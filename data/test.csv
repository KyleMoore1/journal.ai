"i was supposed to be back at the grocery job at 6 am but i traded with another coworker so now im coming in at 2pm. one of the co-workers was provoking so in retaliation i slapped him really hard on his back that took him by surprise. he is nosy and i don't like that. 

the days and times of operation at the pool job has changed so now they only operate on the weekends until labor day but im not working with them this week. i just hope my family don't make another big deal out of it. last time i tried to tell them about the hour changes they accused me of lying.  i really don't want to go back to that place. im so done with that job."
