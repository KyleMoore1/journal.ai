"Time is flying.

Developed my roll of film today. Turned out okay except half of it got exposed when I opened up the back.

I don’t know what I’m gonna write for my college essay in English. Either about how much I love printmaking and how interesting it is, or how art has impacted my life.

I don’t dare write about how mom dying impacted my life.

I wish.

But no.

F doesn’t ever notice me in 5th hour. It really sucks. He only talks to me if he needs something. That’s how it usually is though. I’m just a piece of shit that serves him.

I can’t stop thinking about dying. What if I hung myself in the media lab and F walked in. What would he think? I wish guilt. I don’t though.

I’m a selfish idiot. I keep going to the bathroom and hitting my head or leg because I can’t ducking cut at school.

I said fuck it and went to the media lab to work on shit. Wrote an email to dad and L about how ill pay for the Santa Fe trip. God I’m so excited. It’s gonna be a small group. Ava is a fucking annoying cunt and wants to share a room. I may ask F if I don’t have to. 

I was half way through my email when Mrs. S came in. I really like her. She talks to me as though I was a peer. She’s like married and in her 30’s I think. She’s chill af.

She poked her head in and asked what I was up to. Told her I was crunching some numbers for Santa Fe. 

We talked about the trip a bit. She really wants to come. She might bring her husband. She’s from Albuquerque and kind of wants to go back to visit.

She’s so nice to me. I really like her.

I sent a few emails out when she left and pretty soon class was over. Not any time to do that photo transfer.

Then I went to lunch. I ate with R out in the hall. F got a mini fridge and a microwave so now he eats lunch in the classroom.

I was going back to class after the bell rang. No one was in the room. I wasn’t sure if I could go in or not. I peeked in the door and saw them still eating so I stepped around the corner of the door to wait. I think he called my name and said I could come in.

I said I was sorry. I said I didn’t know if lunch was still going or not. He said I was fine.

I sat down alone. It was awkward.

He made a joke about a panda cupcake he was eating or something.

Then class started and I decided to do a photo transfer. I gave F my file and then I got a pass to go see my counselor.

It was about the ACT. I had asked her a question about how to register and stuff. I sat in her office and she answered my ACT question and then we started talking about college and bullshit.

I still hadn’t talked to F about what I wanted to from Friday.

She was asking me a question about where I would go to find answers to this stuff if she wasn’t around to help me and I started tearing up. Not because I felt like she was attacking me. But because I’m a big dumbass and I hate myself for being so stupid. I started tearing up later again over stress about this whole thing or something and she asked if I was ok. I said I was sorry and I’m just always like this. 

I think she said, that’s not good. I don’t know.

Ughhh.

So I get back to class. It’s practically over. I have like 5 mins. Everyone’s doing their thing. F doesn’t really notice I’m back. I sit down and open my laptop like I’m working or something. I just teared up and stared at my screen.

I just keep thinking of death. Or just cutting my wrist open in class. I can’t and won’t do it.

A minute or two before the bell, Sean notices me crying and being the person he is says are you crying really loud. He hugged me and asked if I was stressed, and I just said. It’s always that. 

I don’t ever know if F notices me.

I got up and went to the bathroom and hit my head and leg.

I came back right as the bell rang. I packed up my stuff, and left.

I calmed down in 7th hour. But then after that we had zine club. It was our first meeting today.

Aug is a great president. He’s really something.

I sat down and was super anxious. The leg bouncing, arm scratching, face hiding kind of anxious.

I sat through the schpeel and stuff. I was sitting there saying how I probably won’t make anything anyways so I won’t fold one up. F asked me if I’d help him coat a screen. We went into the darkroom.

He just needed me to hold the tray. I doubt he really needed me for that. I think he just wanted to talk to me. Maybe. Maybe that’s me being hopeful.

He asked how my Senior year was going. I said some dumb thing probably about how time is flying and how I like it but hate it.

He asked what I was doing 3rd hour tomorrow. He didn’t forget about my message. 

I told him I was sorry. I was stupid. I don’t know. I fucking hate myself.

I had English 3rd hour and couldn’t. 

He said maybe after school but I had work.

Maybe during class?

I don’t know.

I want to die.

I don’t know what to do with myself or my life.

My counselor said she admired me for at least knowing myself and what I want to do with my life.

HA.

Anyways. F really didn’t need that much help.

I left and joined everyone else. He went to the other room to talk with R and her mom about something or another.

I took a pre-folded zine and started scribbling on it and made some stupid thing.

I made another stupid thing.

The front page was just AAAAAAAA
The second page said. “My brain is on fire”
With an illustration of such.
The third spread just said, “TEENAGE EMOTIONS ARE KILLING ME.”
The last page said,
“Why live alone when you can die”

It was super rushed and edgy.

It was my cry for help.

I pay to god someone sees it.

I pray to god no one sees it.

I left and sat down on the steps outside. Dad said he’d be a while.

R offered me a ride. We dropped off Aug at his house. 

I got home and cleaned my room. I felt a random surge of productivity.

I spent the rest of the evening making earrings.

I might have fucked them up with wax paper though.

I should go check. 

But I kind of don’t want to know.

I need to finish my English homework, put a library book on hold, check on my earrings, and bruise my wrist.

I’m such a weird fuck up.

Oh and I cut myself before my shower again. Pretty deep cuts for me. New blade."
"Sometimes I wonder if my ex misses me. I recently unblocked him on Snapchat and Facebook, but he already had me blocked on Snapchat so it’s not like I could see him anyway. I don’t expect him to talk to me. I’m still working on letting go and worrying about myself. I think I tend to focus on other people’s feelings and disregard my own. 

I’ve gotten so much better in the past week or so. Even though I’m still sad, I have moment where I’m a happy person. I finally took a couple good pictures of myself, and a company reached out to me on Instagram to ask if I wanted to be an ambassador for them! No one has ever reached out to me like that, so it’s pretty exciting!

I miss my best friend. I saw her just the other day but it feels like it’s been ages. She was supposed to spend the night on Friday but she ended up working a 10 hour shift so she wasn’t able to. I feel weird about reaching out to her because I’m afraid she doesn’t actually want to see me. 

My twitch channel is finally growing a bit! I only have 43 followers, but I’ve consistently had 3 viewers during my stream. Once I reach 50 followers, people will be able to donate and subscribe to me, so that’s pretty neat. 

I’ve finally had the courage to apply for jobs. I’ve beard back from a couple, but I’m only wanting a temporary postion for now. My school has student positions so I’d like to apply for that at the end of the semester, once my GPA is better. 

I feel so much better with my new medicine. I’ve even started taking sleeping pills, so I (for the most part) no longer have nightmares. I have an appointment on the 20th for a dosage increase on the depression meds, so we’ll see how that goes. I’m currently at 150mg, but it’s necessary. The doctor told me I probbaly won’t be able to go without them for my entire life. That was pretty heartbreaking to hear. 

Anyway, that’s all for today. I know probably no one will read this, but it’s nice to let my feelings out. If someone does manage to come across this, it gets better. I didn’t think it would, but it did. I was at my all time low about a month ago, but I’ve managed to turn it around and become a pretty cool person, mostly. there are still things I need to work on, but I’ve made a ton of progress. 

Thanks for reading :)

p.s. now if only I could get rid of this caffeine addiction....

Edit: I forgot to say this but if you need someone to vent to or if you need help, please pm me. I’m always here to listen and help in any way I can :)"
"i was supposed to be back at the grocery job at 6 am but i traded with another coworker so now im coming in at 2pm. one of the co-workers was provoking so in retaliation i slapped him really hard on his back that took him by surprise. he is nosy and i don't like that. 

the days and times of operation at the pool job has changed so now they only operate on the weekends until labor day but im not working with them this week. i just hope my family don't make another big deal out of it. last time i tried to tell them about the hour changes they accused me of lying.  i really don't want to go back to that place. im so done with that job."
"I am such a wreck right now. My life is actually going so well. I have the best job I could ask for. A new prospective relationship. Round 2 of negative test results. Things are not bad. So why do I have a pit in my chest? Why am I so anxious? Why have I been having panic attacks and sleepless nights all week? 
My best friend is struggling with some mental health issues. And Lord knows I want so desperately to be there and hold her hand through it all and take in every last bit she is feeling if it means she doesn’t have to go through it anymore. But I can’t. And I feel selfish for saying that because it’s more like I won’t. It is too painful. And it’s affecting me so deeply. And it’s not about me and I’m not trying to make it about me. God, I just feel like such a shitty friend. I’m not trying to abandon her in any way. But being around her while she’s going through this has been putting me on edge. My heart pounds in my chest all day every day. And I can’t eat and I just am constantly shaking. Maybe it’s my own issue and has nothing to do with her. But does it make me a shitty friend to say that being around her only makes it worse? Does it mean I’m a shitty friend to put my mental health first? I’m sure most people would disagree. But she is my family. And it kills me to even think about turning my back to family. I just am so tired of shaking and being scared every night. And the one person who I’d run to to talk about it with is my best friend, and I can’t make it about me right now. I feel such pain and sadness for her. But also anger. Anger because I love her so deeply and just want her to get the help she needs but she won’t. Anger because after 12 years of friendship she still doesn’t trust me enough to really tell me what’s happening. I’ve made mistakes in life. But I have always loved that girl like she was my sister and I will always try to do right by her. I just wish I could let go of all of these negative feelings I have. Like I said, maybe it’s not even about her and witnessing her struggle only made me think about what kind of baggage do I have in my life. And what point will that baggage begin to overwhelm me in the same way? And that’s scary.  Our mental health is such a fragile and delicate thing that has to come before every thing, otherwise can we really even live happily? I guess I’m also just tired because I feel like with her ( and everyone else in my life), I’m just stuck carrying other people’s baggage all the time. And it’s too heavy for me. But I have no one to really share it with. And I think part of the reason for these panic attacks is because half the time I just feel like I’m drowning in everyone’s issues around me that they put on me. That I feel constantly. And I just don’t want to burden others with the way I feel so I don’t share it. I’m just going in circles. Point is, I’m tired. And I need to manage how and why I carry everyone else’s issues. Maybe it’s to numb my own? Maybe I like the attention? Probably both. But I feel like I’m dying with these panic attacks so it needs to stop. Anyway, this calmed my heart down some. I should probably sleep."
"I’m 22 physically, but only 12 mentally. 
My mind doesn’t fit in this body and the current situation I’m facing. 
I’m really confused inside. 
Time fly by, I don’t know what should I do. 
Should I do what I love?
Or should I do what I need to do?
I love singing and playing the guitar.
I love speaking English.
But I don’t know anything anymore. 
This seems a dream to me. 
All this is somehow just a dream. 
I want to be a singer actually.
But should I take the time to practice singing instead of study?
I’m confused. 
I’m lost."
