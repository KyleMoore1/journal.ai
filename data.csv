How are you? I am good, just fuzzy in the head.

I miss you so very much, but I don't know how to contact you. I don't know how to contact me either.

Since when did we trip each other, or it's just me? I don't even know if you‚Äôre able to see the world from my eyes, I'm just sitting here with me, confused.  It makes me feel extremely lonely, as my reality aren't there without you.

Let me know if you are hurt physically, OK? I worry way too much sometimes. Have a great day!"

Disgusted and horrified. I just woke up to a cockroach longer than my index finger crawling on me. I was sleeping with the lights on because I had dozed off while browsing on my phone earlier, and I also had the fan on because it‚Äôs hot. My hair is pretty long and the fan causes it to constantly move around and tickle my face, my arms, neck, chest, etc. so I‚Äôm always thinking there is something crawling on me when there really isn‚Äôt, but then on the other hand bugs will land on me/crawl on me and I won‚Äôt realize at first because I assume it‚Äôs just my hair. I think that‚Äôs what happened because I didn‚Äôt realize anything at first, but then I turned over and heard something moving and when I opened my eyes there was a HUGE fucking cockroach right next to my face trying to run away. I literally squealed and jumped out of bed so fast I don‚Äôt even remember doing it, also probably because it was less than a second after I woke up. My vision is really bad and the lighting in my room is pretty dim so I can‚Äôt really see any details when looking at my bed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was still there, so I stood there watching the bed intently for what felt like ten minutes, but in reality was probably only like 2. I started shaking the blankets to see if anything would stir, and then I heard something moving BEHIND ME. The cockroach was in the corner of the room and I could literally hear it crawling because it was so big. I probably looked really stupid, my natural reaction to cockroaches for some reason is to hop around from foot to foot saying ‚Äúew ew ew‚Äù and cursing to myself. I grabbed a shoe and tried to kill it but missed the first time so it started running around all frantically and I was screaming and swinging away with the shoe. I kept smacking it even after it appeared to be dead because I have seen cockroaches play dead, only to jump up and try to run away again. I also grabbed the only bug spray I have which is a raid bug barrier spray and sprayed the cockroach with it a little. Then I sprayed some around the apartment and all the entrances as well. The cockroach is still laying where I killed it but every time I look at it too closely I let out an involuntary yelp and jump back, it seriously gives me the worst fucking heebie jeebies to know that giant thing was crawling on me while I was sleeping. And to think that if I was sleeping with the lights off, I wouldn‚Äôt have even seen it. There have been a lot of weird insects around lately, especially after the recent storm. I have been finding them both inside and outside, huge creepy bugs, but cockroaches I cannot handle. NOPE. I‚Äôm hiding out in the bathroom because I don‚Äôt want to go back in my room and I don‚Äôt want to go back to sleep, or be anywhere inside this apartment right now for that matter. My roommate isn‚Äôt home, I‚Äôm home alone and freaked the fuck out. I‚Äôm so sleepy but I don‚Äôt want to sleep. I think I‚Äôll just take a shower because it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll feel safe and clean right now."

Three weeks into texting with me he revealed his undying feelings of love for me. Well, not undying, but what's wrong with adding a little flavour?

I told him I think he's an utter idiot and should put more tact behind the use of such words, mature.

I was involved in a relationship at that time. For nearly three years, no less, at the time we exchanged our first words. I was commited to make it work, convinced it was endgame.

He said he understands, the lunatic. And should I ever part with the man I was, he addressed me with a plea to give him a shot. I said it's not like that will ever happen, but if it makes you feel at ease, sure. In three weeks it will have been one year since I started officially dating him.

The relationship I had before him fell apart just on the brink of four years. I waited a few months then gave him the promised shot, letting it be known that he's the type I'd bang a few times, but not actually date.

I still don't understand our dynamic to this day. It's a type of love I'm not accustomed to, it cannot compare. I absolutely must analyse this phenomenon with more efficiency. What exactly is it that makes him so dear?

I should probably sleep."

Am I really going to post my thoughts for the whole world to see?

Sh!t

This week has been rough. I am on vacation from my job which is a typically involves going to work before the sun rises and leaving after the sun starts to set.

You may think, hell yeah, this girls out enjoying summer.  She‚Äôs probably soaking up that Sun, floating on some waves or hiking up a freaking mountain .

Wrong.

I haven‚Äôt left my house in days.  I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs keeping me trapped here.


I‚Äôm unhappy with myself. I don‚Äôt believe the world should get to know me.

I have zero friends. I mean zero.  Sure, I‚Äôve gone out to bars,  sang  my heart out at karaoke, even joined a social sports league,

 I found myself sitting alone at table.  No one interested in getting to know me. No one wanting to see how I‚Äôve been. No one wanting to know what‚Äôs new in my life.

I‚Äôd approach someone I‚Äôve met before once or twice, ask them how they‚Äôve been. They‚Äôd politely say good and walk away.

It sure makes a girl wonder? What the f*ck is wrong with me? Am I that terrible.

This takes a huge toll on my psyche. It‚Äôs probably why I don‚Äôt leave the house.  I should probably be in therapy.

I find myself binge eating to fill the void.  Often times it‚Äôs pizza or a burger and fries.  I never reach for the healthy foods.  I do make the effort to buy them. I have decent meals all planned out in my head. But in reality the food rots in the fridge until I inevitably have to throw it away.

I feel like I‚Äôm going through the motions of life but not truly living.

0,"And so it begins
I've never been one to write great introductory words.  *Start at the beginning.* What a cliche and thing to say, the kind I welcome only to eagerly dismiss. Is there ever such a thing? Albeit I might be under the influence of my studies, I feel as if it's the best stance to take, it's disburdening. If I take that time *per se* is a form of measure (in the sense of papa Aristoteles and his musings who seemed to have a huge problem with Timaios back in his day) that measures the distance in between *then* and *now* it would seem safe to say that in a way it's a mere tool we invented for us ourselves, as per habit, to make our living more pleasant by putting it into little organised brackets. Clarity, structure, practicality.

&#x200B;

Sure, it's really handy, I'll admit every *time*. If you want to play God and mix and match some equations in physics, wake up for this or that obscure reason at a certain o'clock (why  sleep anyway?) or set an appointment for whatever dreadful deed you're about to commit in a way that you and the other guy don't miss one another. But honestly, what about those moments when it feels as if time is out of space? In the above mentioned situations it seems to be in that place, exactly where it should be. I used to smoke weed every now and then in high school, it is no untold truth that it makes passing feel very fast, but then you whip out your whatever means of counting time and you realise only 15 minutes had gone and during you went from confused teen to some sort of protophilosopher, a thinker of life and and all things yadayada. I never enjoyed the feeling anyway, I prefer my throat not dry and my thoughts boozed, should they be influenced by anything mind-altering or intoxicated at all to begin with. Then of course, there is an entire collection of #inspirational post friendly sayings and the corny situations you find yourself saying them in (yes, I've been guilty, too) such as ..*time sure flies with you.. time goes fast when you're having fun..* Speaking of an obsession with measure. Pretty jeopardising situations, those are - for said measure, of course. I don't pride in writing Yoda-style, but sometimes it just feels like it fits, does it not?

It happens too often that something vastly applicable to science and day to day routine just doesn't fit into the whole picture and as soon as someone points to that difference they feel as if on the path of a poet in becoming, a dreamer. I've always wished to learn how to write in a less scattered way and a more cohesive one, but that would merely expose me to pretending I am already assured of and oriented towards the outcome. It's not about being indecisive, more so about being infinitely open in all directions. Why forcefully strive for an ending or resolve when there are options as handy as a cute, 'simple' aporia? But halt, silly me -  simple is what makes it all so complex, which is actually a good thing. If only I knew how to trace back through the complex to reattain the simple. Note to self; time to start laying out some metaphorical replacement for breadcrumbs.

&#x200B;

Back to the topic if there ever was one to begin with. I believe that there is and should be no such thing as temporality in the sense of measure. For speaking and referring to that, which *was* before and  declaring that which *will* and is yet to take place, is done always and with no exception within the present. Therefore all manifests itself within said present - future and past. It may sound like the type of knowledge tacky Latin phrases such as *Carpe diem!* stem from, but no. As long as the word *diem* stands for *day,* I won't be fooled. For me there are no days, nor are there years. There's only now, now being the only constant, and the brief sense of passing, the awareness as one now fades into another and so on. Sometimes one now can stretch for a bit longer than the other. Time is all events concentrated in a certain space, all manifesting themselves in the temporary-eternal now in all of their grandeur. That is why I've always been one to carry all things with me through the entirety of my life, willingly or not. It used to be a pain, so I decided to become a student in the art of not recepting feelings.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hard to reboot my urge to write.  It's on the brink of extinction, hanging by a loose thread. And I really need to brush up on my English, it's gotten too rigid. Especially if I am to commence my studies in a foreign country next year. I told myself I'd write about me and attempt at a deep, structured delve into my psyche.. but I just got tangled again. Written words that  start uncontrollably forming longer sentences really are the most comfortable sanctuary.. if you let them go free and assume that role. Perhaps I'll delve into mentioned psyche during another now."

A good book is to me what a freshly dead cow is to a starved coyote.

For the past year, I‚Äôve done nothing.

It was hard getting through to my little cousin.

She doesn‚Äôt like being hugged or kissed or touched.

Not used to it, I guess.

But I was home alone until my aunt and uncle left her with me, so we had hours of uninterrupted time to spend together.

We did colouring.

Played hide-and-seek.

Built a pillow fort behind the couch.

Each time, I kept getting closer.

Eventually, I won her over.

She was tired, so I put on her favourite Disney movie soundtrack and sat with her on the couch while she played a game on my phone.

She didn‚Äôt want to talk, so I didn‚Äôt say anything.

But whenever she looked at me, she saw I was still there, still watching, still interested in her.

So she started showing me the screen, so I could see what she was doing.

She needed help with a level.

So I said: ‚ÄúLet me see.‚Äù

And I patted the spot next to me on the couch.

She scooted over, and held out the phone.

I thought she would pull away again.

But she stayed.

Maybe she caught my surprise, because she looked up at me in confusion.

Her tiny, knitted brow asked: *Is this ok?*

I smiled down at her.

Kissed her ringlet-covered head.

Then wrapped my arm around her and pulled her in even closer.

For a moment, she froze.

Then I felt her little muscles relax, and she snuggled into my side.

She rested her head in the crook of my shoulder.

I rested mine on top of hers.

She sighed.

It was the gentle kind; one you take right when you get comfortable, seconds before you fall asleep.

I took one, too.

And the world slowed down.

And the noise in my mind went quiet.

So much had changed. Especially my perspective on so many things.

Subtle things I can‚Äôt explain.

I‚Äôm in love with freedom. I love my family, but I love freedom in a different way.

I still have a hard time getting to sleep. The dark thoughts creep in. Yesterday I started sobbing reading old diary entries.

It‚Äôs insane to see how much has changed. Good and bad. But the thing I realized the most is how much I miss F.

But then I start wondering if he even gives one shit about me. He gives shits‚Äî lots of them. I just refuse to believe he could give a shit about this piece of shit.

I can‚Äôt wait to see him again.

Being at art school has put a totally new perspective on art. I know I have to learn to be true to myself. My real self, not some projected self. If I want to survive and make real art. I need to be real.

Yesterday I jokingly said I‚Äôm pretty much in the AF fan club.

It‚Äôs kind of true. I wish I weren‚Äôt so obsessive but still. I‚Äôve said this 100 times or more by now.

Speaking of 100, 100 days ago F found out about my self injury.

Sometimes I think he came into my life to give me support during a rough time. I really like how loving he is with me and how we used to listen to podcasts everyday. We don't do that much anymore and I feel like he's less of a friend now and that makes me sad but we talk three times as much. I really miss Greg we just fit together and there's nothing but calm and love between us. I shouldn't be upset but I actually am that j messed up my sleeping schedule a lot.  Should be happy somebody wants to give me this much attention but it's almost turning me off. A couple weeks ago me and Greg talked about how we never have ssx  anymore but really all we had to say was hey our medicine kills our sex drive and we're okay with that and I actually am. J thinks about sex a lot. Ii feel like an object to him sometimes which is gross. My dogs hate him and especially hate his voice. J and I fight quite a bit and I'm really not used to it. Me and Greg never fight and I can only think of mine time and it ended with us both crying and becoming closer. Sometimes I think j just likes to fight and I guess I do too. I've always been the argumentative type that's why I was so close to Doug for so long. It was a bad idea but I did message Doug. He reminds me not j. He does that joking it a loser shut up cute kind of banter but I'm not too into it.  Our washer went out and I literally haven't washed clothes in a month and I'm probably not really that upset BC it's hard for me to get motivated enough to clean. We're going to get grandpas oldnfridge which is actually kind of exciting to me. I don't really have anything left of him. We're getting a new washer soon too. I'm pretty surprised that we're getting both? It feels like forever since we've had both. My dad's bio dad sent him a hundred today and like get those bandz but I still feel weird about him ESP when he flipped the way he did.

Every time I think it‚Äôs finally my turn to lean on her for support, something else comes up.

I thought I‚Äôd already heard her whole childhood.

I thought I was done taking care of her.

I really needed her to be there for me this weekend.

If anything, I have more empathy for her now.

Hearing her story explains a lot.

Hopefully this will make it easier to forgive her.

I called my mom today.

She picked up on the first ring.

She said: ‚ÄúHi, baby.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI just went to Starbucks.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù

That was all it took to get me started.

For the next fifteen minutes, I told her all about my experience with Starbuck‚Äôs.

It was *not* a good one.

(Objectively, the experience was fine. I, on the other hand, was not.)

I‚Äôll spare myself the effort of writing out the details.

It was a long conversation.

But I was angry.

Obviously, I wasn‚Äôt really *that* upset about Starbucks.

It‚Äôs shitty, overpriced coffee.

Whatever.

But something had definitely set me off.

Maybe this was really about being diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.

I‚Äôm pissed I have to keep eating gluten and deal with all these symptoms for *months* while I‚Äôm stuck on a stupid waiting list for an endoscopy.

Apparently, if I stop eating gluten, my intestinal damage will heal and it‚Äôll mess up the results.

They need to see the damage for themselves before they can officially tell me to stop eating gluten.

Why are they making me wait to shove a tube up my ass, so they can tell me what I already know?

It‚Äôs fucking stupid.

It‚Äôs not even like I wanna give up gluten. I‚Äôm not excited to stop eating food that tastes good forever.

But it‚Äôs better than fatigue, intense stomach pain, diarrhea, bloating, migraines, weird rashes, mood swings, hives, puking, and all the other symptoms.

Just let me stop, so I can feel better!

But they won‚Äôt.

The doctor told my mom I need one, and my mom always listens to the doctors.

Which means I‚Äôm getting an endoscopy.

So I just have to keep dealing with all this extra pain, even though I *know* what I need to do to fix it.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry about that.

Or maybe this was really about going to my crush‚Äôs house to hang out last night.

It was me and three guys- my crush, who I barely knew, and his two friends, who were total strangers.

Just me and three guys.

Alone.

And they were drinking.

I got so anxious it‚Äôs unbelievable.

I made a complete and total fool of myself.

At one point, my crush lifted his hand to rub his eye, and I fucking *flinched*.

He noticed.

And I kept making weird jokes about spraying RAID in their eyes or killing them or beating them up.

One of them tried to make it less weird by making a joke about hurting me back.

I got so scared, my reflexes took over and I literally grabbed the can of RAID.

They were pretty fucking weirded out by that one.

Who can blame them?

I left after an hour.

I *hate* PTSD!

I thought I was over this shit.

So maybe I‚Äôm angry at myself, for ruining everything.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry that I‚Äôm gonna die alone because I‚Äôm *still* so fucking broken.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry at the world, for making me this way.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry at that.

Or maybe this was really about my mom.

She texted me the other day out of nowhere, just to tell me she loved me and that everything will be ok.

*That* made me *really* mad.

That was the one thing I‚Äôve always wanted to hear.

The one thing she never told me when I needed it.

But that day, I didn‚Äôt need it.

I had a lot going on, but she didn‚Äôt know *any* of it.

And even if she did, I don‚Äôt want that from her.

It‚Äôs too late for it to ever mean anything.

She stole my comfort!

She took the one thing I‚Äôve always wanted, and ruined it forever.

Hearing it from her, with no context, when she doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs wrong, hurt me more than I can say.

Seeing those texts made me cry, in a bad way.

But I couldn‚Äôt even tell her to stop, because she did something nice! And that would be ungrateful.

She took the thing I always tell myself when I need to feel better away from me.

Now, whenever I think those words to myself, I just see her stupid texts.

And it makes me feel worse instead of better.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry about that.

Who knows?

It could be anything.

But it probably wasn‚Äôt really Starbucks.

And I could only yell about their stupid, overpriced coffee and judge-y barista and pretentious hipster customers for so long before even I felt ridiculous.

(It still felt good, though. I regret nothing.)

(Fuck you, Starbucks.)

Eventually, I felt better.

And I was glad I went to Starbucks instead of Tim Horton‚Äôs this morning.

It gave me something safe enough that I could call my mom about when really I needed to talk.

And I‚Äôm grateful that my mom listened to my angry rant about Starbucks.

She didn‚Äôt have to do that.

There was a time when she wouldn‚Äôt have.

But she did, and it made me feel better. And when I got off the phone, I felt lucky that I could call her at all, even if I couldn‚Äôt *really* talk to her.

I‚Äôm starting to accept that there are certain things my mom just can‚Äôt give me.

Maybe my mom is like Starbucks coffee.

It‚Äôs not Tim Horton‚Äôs.

But at least it‚Äôs coffee.

And their coffee isn‚Äôt *that* bad.

Once I calmed down, I took another sip.

And I texted my mom:

*Actually, I kinda like this coffee now*

*I‚Äôve adjusted to the taste*

There‚Äôs a hole in my heart, one that can‚Äôt be filled with coffee- not even Tim Horton‚Äôs.

It makes me sad that I‚Äôll never be able to talk to my mom about anything that matters.

It‚Äôs hard not being able to get any real comfort.

It‚Äôs harder knowing I‚Äôll never be able to.

But this is my reality.

When it comes to the tough stuff, I‚Äôm always gonna be alone. I‚Äôll never have someone I can rely on.

I‚Äôll never get real comfort.

That‚Äôs just the hand I‚Äôve been dealt.

So I just have to deal with it, and move on.

At least I *have* a mom, one who‚Äôs willing to try.

And she did make me feel a little better.

Maybe my mom is like Starbucks.

I just have to get used to the taste."

I feel better about what happened to me today, because what happened to my housemate was so much worse.

Is that fucked up?

I‚Äôm not saying hers was worse in an insecure way.

It was just... so much worse.

Hearing all the details made me sick.

We had a conversation about that today.

It went like this:

She said: ‚ÄúHey, I just... You don‚Äôt feel bad that I reported my rape, right? Cuz, like, you don‚Äôt have to feel guilty about your choice or anything.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúActually, you reporting yours made me feel way better about my choice. Because yours was *so* much worse than mine. *Yours* needs to be reported. Mine doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that! Yours was bad, too.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo, not in a way to put mine down. Just, like, hearing the details of yours yesterday made me feel physically sick. Like, I thought I was gonna throw up.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat happened to me was a bunch of stupid teenagers who took their fun a little too far and forgot that I‚Äôm a person, too. But they weren‚Äôt *malicious*. They were just assholes, and idiots.‚Äù

She started to say something, but I cut her off.

I said: ‚ÄúWhat happened to you was pure evil.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDo you really mean that?‚Äù

I stared her straight in the face.

I said: ‚ÄúI can forgive mine after hearing yours, because at least mine were human beings. What happened to you... only a monster could do something like that.‚Äù

She had this look on her face.

I really hoped I wasn‚Äôt triggering her.

I continued: ‚ÄúThat shit *affected* me, dude. I can‚Äôt even imagine how *you* feel! Like, *I* was maybe-raped and I can‚Äôt even *imagine* what happened to you! Mine was a mistake. Yours was a crime.‚Äù

Her eyes welled with tears.

She said: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine it, either.‚Äù

She took a deep, shaking breath.

Then she said: ‚ÄúThat is *so* validating. Thank you. And I‚Äôm so glad it helped you! I was worried.‚Äù

I said: ‚Äú*You* don‚Äôt have to worry about *me*. *I‚Äôm* fine. Worry about yourself right now, girl.‚Äù

She smiled.

She said: ‚ÄúI feel so much better now.‚Äù

When she said that, I smiled and said: ‚ÄúMe, too.‚Äù"

My mom sometimes likes to tell a funny story from when I was little.

I was 3 or 4 years old.

We were arguing about something.

My mom doesn‚Äôt remember what it was about.

But apparently, something she said just set me off.

I balled up my little-kid fists, stamped my tiny foot, and told her: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a stupid bitch!‚Äù

My mom did not like that at all.

She bent down and stuck her face right in mine.

She screamed: ‚ÄúWhere did you learn that word!‚Äù

This is the part where my mom starts to laugh.

She usually mimics exactly how loud and angry she shouted, how close she got to my face.

Then she mimics me as a toddler, wide-eyed, shrinking back in terror.

My mom can barely contain her laughter as she imitates how small my shaking voice got.

She says I told her, in a voice barely above a whisper: ‚ÄúFrom you, mummy.‚Äù

At this point in the story, my mom can no longer contain herself.

Sometimes, she laughs so hard she has to sit down.

She says: ‚ÄúI forgot I said stuff like that around you! Oh, god, you should have seen the look on your cute little face. You were *terrified!*‚Äù

My mom loves to tell that story.

Apparently, I look pretty funny when I‚Äôm afraid.

One time, when she told me that, I asked her: ‚ÄúSo what did you do after I said I learned it from you?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI sent you to your room, obviously. You were misbehaving.‚Äù"

I feel like they can all hear my breathing
She left the window open again tonight and I had to close it before I sweat to death.
Sweat dripped down my leg on the bus.
I‚Äôve never sweat droplets before.

And I miss F.

I really do.

I saw a picture of him today with a group of people and he looked so happy. I can‚Äôt help but grin.

And when I was in the hospital,
‚ÄúHey ‚Äî‚Äî-. Are you OK? I saw your Instagram post. You‚Äôre in the hospital?! What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

He cares about me. For real.

Some days he‚Äôs the only thing that reminds me that life is worth living. His smile keeps me from just giving up.

I want to make him proud.

But I haven‚Äôt done a SINGLE thing I‚Äôm proud of this past week. I haven‚Äôt made shit.

Linocuts are not fun. I fucked up big time. I wish I‚Äôd been the hospital a day longer. I‚Äôm so behind. I‚Äôll never catch up.

At least me and my photo teacher bonded over our meningitis hospitalizations. That was cool. I‚Äôm pretty sure she knows F. The subject of their art is vaguely similar, yet stylistically different. Plus being local counts.

Regardless, I miss him.

Maybe it‚Äôs weird to miss a teacher.

But he‚Äôs more than a teacher. He‚Äôs a mentor, and just everything I long to be.

And I was the biggest dumbass yesterday.

I had a mini mental breakdown like 5 separate times and I had to go to the bathroom to wipe my tears.

I was cleaning my space which took me half a hour. And I just stared down and could not stop thinking about how much of a failure I was. I just wanted to take the nearest sharp object and just rip my skin apart and die right there.

And I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking like this. Eventually I got it all cleaned and slowly walked back to my space. R saw me and was like are you okay? I was like yeahhh yeah. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I said I was fine and left.

You can‚Äôt just tell acquaintances that you can‚Äôt stop imagining yourself dead or dying. That you hate yourself and am sorry for existing.

Our RA‚Äôs knocked on our door for a bed check. When I opened the door all four of them were doing some damn fortnight dance. I almost died, it was the funniest thing ever.

They‚Äôre really chill. At first I didn‚Äôt love them, but they are actually cool as fuck.

And I‚Äôm back to cursing all the time again. It‚Äôs kind of nice but I hate it. I always wonder if I do it too much.

The girl in the room next to mine cut off her hair because it was her 18th birthday and she could do whatever she wanted. She also bought lotto tickets.

We played cards against humanity for a few hours, then went to the fourth floor rooms where we weren‚Äôt allowed. Stupid rule. One of the girls room was almost fully decorated and had a mini fridge.

For a 3 week camp.

Then we decided to see if the elevator was haunted. We made an Ouija board and sat in a circle in the elevator and traveled up and down to all the floors.

It ended up with some spirit named Moz and is apparently angry with me for taking my finger off. Moz is 100 years old.

I don‚Äôt believe in this shit but it‚Äôs funny as fuck.

I wish I didn‚Äôt hate myself.

I wish I could just be content with my flaws."

I think I hit my head on the corner of it before I fell.

My head hurt.

I lay there, exhausted, way too drunk.

And I remember hoping they would let me just lie there and rest.

But then the blond one came over.

He said: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

Then the others came, too.

And they lifted me.

And they carried me to the bedroom.

And they dropped me on the bed, face down.

I remember lying there, with my face buried in the blue cotton bedsheets, barely conscious.

And they all stood over me in a circle.

And the blond one said: ‚ÄúAlright. Who‚Äôs first?‚Äù"
0,"13.07.19. Free time
Some of my friends and I were talking about our childhoods the other day.

My housemate told us about hers.

She said she spent her summers roaming up and down the street with her childhood best friend.

They had total freedom.

Once she spent three days making a giant chalk mural on the driveway.

Another time, she got really into vlogging, and spent all day learning how to edit videos.

She made lots of crafts whenever she was bored.

And each day, her parents would ask her: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing today?‚Äù

And she would tell them.

And her mom would be right inside if any of the kids needed anything.

Otherwise, they could do whatever they wanted.

Sounds made up to me.

She said she didn‚Äôt even do extracurriculars during the school year.

She could join whatever clubs she wanted, but as long as she did her homework and one hour of reading a day, her time was her own.

My jaw dropped when I heard that one.

I guess we had different childhoods.

My school was dual-curriculum with 14 subjects, taught in four languages.

We got out an hour later than the other schools, and then it was off to activities.

I did everything.

Competitive dance, pre-Olympic swimming, gymnastics taught by an ex-Navy SEAL, piano lessons, violin lessons, art classes, tutoring at least 3 times a week (daily during exams), and volunteering.

I was even a child voice actor in fifth grade!

My housemate was making crafts after school when she was ten years old.

At the same age, I was going to work.

When I got home at around 7pm every day, I would watch the kids while my mom made dinner.

Then we‚Äôd eat and put the kids to bed, and the day was over- unless I had homework.

During summers, it was more of the same.

When I was really young, I went to day camps, skill-building workshops, volunteer opportunities, or summer school to fill mine and my parents‚Äô time.

Once I turned seven, I was shipped off to overnight camp until school started again.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I‚Äôm very grateful for all the opportunities I was given.

I‚Äôm lucky that I got to do all that stuff.

But looking back, I realized I‚Äôve never had free time.

I‚Äôve always followed a schedule, set by someone else.

Every second of my life was carefully regimented as I got passed from person to person and place to place.

The only time I was allowed to be alone and do what I wanted was when I locked myself away in my room.

It wasn‚Äôt even like my parents cared what I did.

They never pushed me to win awards or get good grades or try my best or even go to school if I didn‚Äôt feel like it- I skipped most of middle school to spend full days sleeping off depressive spirals in my room.

They never asked me what I was doing.

They never asked me how I was doing.

They never really asked me anything at all.

(Unless they needed something.)

They didn‚Äôt care if I slept through my lessons or got straight A‚Äôs.

They just needed me out of the way.

I‚Äôm really lucky that they filled up my time with camps and lessons and tutors and workshops and jobs.

I‚Äôve had a very interesting life, to say the least.

And I learned a lot doing all that stuff.

I always tried my best.

But... I‚Äôm tired.

And I need a break.

This past year has taken a lot out of me.

I think I‚Äôm gonna take some time off from school."

I was in my friend‚Äôs dorm room, sitting on her bed in the dark late at night.

It was one of those nights where you just talk about everything.

I had never had one of those nights before.

Everything was going great.

My grades were good, I had an active social life, I was independent for the first time, and I was having all sorts of new experiences.

But somewhere in the back of my brain, there was this little niggling feeling.

Deep beneath the surface, there was a pressure.

And it was starting to build.

So, when my friend asked me: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your deepest, darkest secret- something you‚Äôve never told anyone?‚Äù

I told her: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember any of seventh grade.‚Äù

And when I thought about it, I realized there was a lot more I didn‚Äôt remember than just seventh grade.

I told her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm missing chunks of time.‚Äù

And then I remembered something my old AP psych teacher mentioned once, about repressed memories.

And I got this pit in my stomach.

I told her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified of what I might be forgetting.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat could be so bad that I can‚Äôt even think about it?‚Äù

I knew I had a choice to make.

I could learn to live with the uncertainty.

Or I could try to figure out what happened, and learn to live with the consequences.

My friend asked: ‚ÄúDo you wish you knew?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I thought that was the end of it.

But I‚Äôm too curious for my own good.

Without even trying, my memories came back.

I started putting the pieces together.

And my life fell apart."

I think about him all the time.

When I‚Äôm doing things, I imagine him being there, doing them with me.

I want to hold his hand.

I want to make him smile.

I want him to force himself inside me.

I want him to make me say I want it.

I want him to make me ask for it.

I want him.

And I want him to want me, too.

I know he likes my personality, because he keeps responding to my texts, and he invited me to hang out with him and his childhood friend this weekend.

But he won‚Äôt like *me* unless I blow his mind in bed.

If I make him wait too long, he could get impatient.

All his testosterone will build up, and he won‚Äôt be able to control himself.

Better for me to take charge, and fuck him right away.

If I don‚Äôt, anything could happen.

He could leave me.

...Or worse.

But if I do, then I win.

He‚Äôll be mine.

I‚Äôll own him.

And he‚Äôll own me, too.

And he‚Äôll keep coming back for more.

And more.

And I‚Äôll get to give him what he wants.

I‚Äôll get to *be* what he wants.

And then, it‚Äôll just be a matter of how much I can take, before I feel too gross and get rid of him.

In the past, I ghosted guys right after I fucked them.

After, I didn‚Äôt want to see them anymore.

My mom thought I was overreacting.

She made me apologize.

I blamed it on the celiac.

Said coming to terms with my diagnosis was making me act out.

...I guess having an autoimmune disease isn‚Äôt that bad, if I can make excuses out of it. Lol.

But I bet he‚Äôs disgusted with himself for even trying.

Who could blame him?

He even got right off me when I told him to the other day when he had me pinned to the bed!

He could have done whatever he wanted.

But he didn‚Äôt.

He just got off.

Without even a fight.

He doesn‚Äôt even *want* me!

He just thinks I‚Äôm an easy target because he knows I‚Äôm desperate and easy and no one likes me.

But I bet since I told him ‚Äúno‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt even like me anymore. I‚Äôm not worth the effort.

That‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt responding to me.

My personality‚Äôs not *that* good.

It‚Äôs enough to make him like me.

I didn‚Äôt even have sex with him!

Why did I make him wait??

Now he‚Äôs losing interest!

He‚Äôs just stringing me along, pretending to want someone he can talk to, because there‚Äôs no one here during the summer he can actually fuck.

He‚Äôs just bored.

But he hooked up with *Kate*.

Kate‚Äôs *gorgeous*.

When all the girls like Kate get back to school, he‚Äôll drop me so fast.

Finally, there will be girls he can have sex with.

Girls who aren‚Äôt ugly and broken.

Girls who want sex right away, who don‚Äôt have to wait.

And I‚Äôll have fallen head over heels for him, and then he‚Äôll break my heart like it‚Äôs nothing.

I‚Äôll be an embarrassing story his friends laugh about.

I‚Äôm just some stupid, insecure girl who was desperate enough to believe that someone like him could ever want someone like me.

But he doesn‚Äôt.

Of course he doesn‚Äôt.

And if he did, I scared him off.

Why did I text him back so fast?

I should have waited longer!

But I responded as soon as I saw it.

And now he knows I‚Äôm a desperate loser who wants him, and I came on way too strong, and he doesn‚Äôt want me anymore.

I‚Äôm gonna die alone.

Who could ever want me?

And how could I be stupid enough to think *he* would?

He‚Äôs so much better than that.

He‚Äôs way out of my league.

It‚Äôs really been crazy. Miles is my boyfriend now. He is an odd guy but I like it. He makes me feel things I haven‚Äôt in a while. It‚Äôs uncomfortable for me. I‚Äôve only had one previous boyfriend who was a good guy. He tells me I‚Äôm beautiful. I don‚Äôt know how to accept the compliments. I‚Äôm pretty much in like with this guy. I feel really lucky to meet someone like him. He makes me feel so confident and instead of always bringing me down he lifts me up. He respects my personal space. We even take days to ourselves. It‚Äôs so nice to date a man and not a man child.

My daughter has been acting out. Everything is changing. Her dad isn‚Äôt really involved or interested. He came to visit and she has been just an absolute terror to me since. I am trying so hard to be patient and understanding but man...  it‚Äôs killing me inside to see her suffer. I really don‚Äôt know how to help her. I can understand how an absentee dad can leave a huge hole in your heart. I wish I had her with someone who wasn‚Äôt him. I hope I can show her how great it can be without him.


I was suppose to go back to work Monday. I ended up stranded on the highway and I even got hit by my own car. I‚Äôm still waiting for my internet for my work stuff at home to be up and running.  Meh. I miss working but I wish I could find what I love. Who knows."

I‚Äôm having a breakdown
I just relapsed in the bathroom of my dream college

My whole body hurts
My throat is sore as shit
My head throbs

And I fucking miss my mom
The RA, K, seems a bit worried. I reassured her I was fine.

I‚Äôm not good at art

I‚Äôm shit

I wanna die

My life drawings were good though

But I‚Äôm just so dead

My roommate is worried
But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because she thinks I‚Äôm sick and doesn‚Äôt want to catch what I have

I can‚Äôt believe I fucking relapsed

It woke me up and calmed me down

I‚Äôm hopeless

I wanna just jump out the fucking window

My last performance piece

I hate monotypes

I hate my self

I hate the way I act

I don‚Äôt wanna be conscious"
0,"09.07.19. Family spats
I went back to school today.

But first, my Bubbie came for high tea.

(Sometimes I forget how much my home life resembles an episode of Gossip Girl.)

I‚Äôm glad she came.

We had a really good time together.

We always do.

I told her I want to drop out.

She said: ‚ÄúNo matter what you choose to do, I trust you.‚Äù

I love her.

As per usual with my family, though, things went south after a few hours.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly when it went wrong.

It started with my parents wanting to put my Bubbie in a retirement home.

Somehow, it escalated.

And suddenly everyone was yelling and upset and accusing each other of being abusive.

...But I had a train to catch.

So we all piled in the car and drove me to the station, giving me about 20 minutes to sort everything out.

Perfect.

I did my best, but I couldn‚Äôt completely resolve everything by the time we got to the train.

So I sent my mom a text:

*Hey, I think bubby‚Äôs problem is she feels guilty about  the accusations and is afraid to admit she was an abuser. If you tell her that everyone makes mistakes and we obviously forgive her and still love her no matter what, maybe she‚Äôll apologize. She‚Äôs probably just afraid and yelling at her won‚Äôt help*

*And you can tell her that of course she did the best  she could as a working single mom in a shitty situation, but that doesn‚Äôt mean no one got hurt in the fallout. It doesn‚Äôt have to all be her fault for him to  deserve an apology*

*I doubt she‚Äôd wanna die without getting that closure*

(Ok, I guess I sent her a few texts.)

My mom responded:

*I do recall having that conversation months ago but she refused to listen*

*Well. One would think but truthfully I think she doesn‚Äôt want to die with people thinking she‚Äôs abuser*

I texted back:

*Hmm*

*Maybe I‚Äôll talk to her next time then* ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*You always sound like you‚Äôre yelling even if you‚Äôre not* üòÇ

*maybe you‚Äôre just too loud*

(That was code for: you screamed at her the whole time, and it accomplished nothing. Get out of my way.)

My mom responded:

üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*But she is sooo frustrating*

I said:

*I think your approach skips the step where you take her feelings into consideration*

*You‚Äôre forgetting how hard this must be for her*

*And he accused her while she was scared about the church thing, which wouldn‚Äôt help*

(Last year, my cousin, Bubbie‚Äôs daughter, had a psychotic breakdown and tried to blow up a church.)

I continued:

*And imagine if YOU were an abuser. You‚Äôd feel terrible!*

(That one was hard to type.)

My mom texted back:

*I did al long time ago! This has need for a year!!*

I said:

*Well she clearly still feels that way*

*You can understand her guilt and her pain and THEN guide her to an apology*

*You‚Äôre a social worker! You should know this* üòÇüòÇ

My mom said:

*I think she feels terrible about the accusations*

(Which was... what I said. But whatever.)

I said:

*Exactly*

*So tell her why she doesn‚Äôt have to feel terrible*

*It wasn‚Äôt her fault she was in that situation*

*Everyone makes mistakes*

My mom said:

*Yes. It all makes sense*

I said:

*And then ask her if it really doesn‚Äôt matter or if she‚Äôs just afraid*

*And then tell her she has nothing to be afraid of*

*We all already forgive her*

*And we still love her*

*And once she apologizes, this will all be over*

My mom said:

*You should go into social work*

I told her:

*I‚Äôm not doing this bullshit for the rest of my life, lol*

*I just want her to feel better*

Then the train pulled out of the station, and I lost cell reception for the next few hours.

Luckily, I was occupied.

Our talk had given me a lot to think about.

Somehow, someone else in my life always ends up having the same problems I do.

And it‚Äôs so *easy* to help other people.

I usually find by the time I‚Äôve solved their problem, I‚Äôve solved my own, too.

Even the hard ones.

...Maybe especially those.

I learned a lot about forgiveness today.

I feel better now.

About a lot of things.

And I‚Äôm grateful I got to be a part of this.

They‚Äôve taught me a lot of lessons I might never have learned on my own.

(Maybe because I wouldn‚Äôt have needed to- lol!)

My family‚Äôs crazy, but they‚Äôre mine.

And I‚Äôm lucky for that.

I love them.

And in their own, fucked up way, they make me better.

I had barely stepped off the train when my phone rang, alerting me I had reception again.

It was my sister.

She said: ‚ÄúMummy just called me fat!‚Äù

In the background, I could hear the screams of an argument breaking out.

I sighed.

‚ÄúBeen there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù"
0,"09.07.19. Moving on
It‚Äôs been six months since I tried to kill myself.

It‚Äôs crazy how much better I feel.

For the past few days, I‚Äôve been stressing about the future. Should I drop out? What do I want to do? Etc.

Six months ago, I didn‚Äôt *have* a future.

I literally couldn‚Äôt picture it.

I was so wrapped up in the past; in all that pain.

That was all I could see.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw someone who hurt me.

Those boys.

My mom.

My dad.

My old stalker.

The guy who tried to kill me.

My old teachers.

The doctors at the hospital.

The man without a face, who molested me.

A friend, who took advantage of me.

Another friend, who only tried.

Other boys.

My family.

Dr. Fisher.

My extended family.

More boys.

So, so many boys.

And so many others.

So many hurts.

My brain was like a salad spinner.

All the memories got thrown in together as they flung around my mind in endless circles.

I couldn‚Äôt think.

I couldn‚Äôt see past the pain.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt even distinguish the thoughts anymore. Everything blurred into one big hurt.

And I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

But in the last six months, something changed.

...Me.

I started facing all the things I thought I couldn‚Äôt.

I reached out for help.

I made lots of changes.

I spent countless hours thinking and learning and trying my best to get better.

I remember the first night I felt it.

It was before I started journaling here.

I didn‚Äôt have an outlet for all the shit in my head.

So I opened a word document, and pretended I was an author writing a book.

And I told my whole story.

That was the only time I‚Äôve ever shared the details of what happened that night.

The night that changed everything.

...For better or for worse.

I cried the entire time.

Not nice crying- ugly, heaving, uncontrollable sobs.

When it was over, I saved the file.

Closed it.

Shut my laptop.

Went right to sleep.

And just like that, it was over.

I haven‚Äôt looked at that word document since.

I don‚Äôt even remember what I called it.

I might never open it again.

It served its purpose.

It‚Äôs over now.

Writing let me get the thoughts out of my head.

And once they were gone, they left space for something new.

For the past six months, all I‚Äôve done it write.

And talk, once I learned how.

(I‚Äôm still figuring that one out, though.)

I‚Äôve been cleaning up the mess inside my head.

It‚Äôs not easy.

And it‚Äôs not over- not by a long shot.

But today, I woke up.

And my head was clear.

And I realized how much space I have in there.

Today, when I woke up, I was stressed about the future.

Then I realized: *I‚Äôm stressed about the **future**.*

I‚Äôm not stuck in the past anymore.

Memories don‚Äôt have the same power over me as they used to. Their grip has loosened a little.

Now, I can breathe.

I can think again.

All that work... is working.

The hardest part is over.

I‚Äôm moving on.

I feel better."

I. LOVE. COLLEGE.

Oh my FUCKING god.

This is the best thing that I‚Äôve ever done.

My roommate is super chill and we‚Äôre kind of already friends... maybe??

I was so worried she‚Äôd be a creep or annoying, but she‚Äôs the most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person in the entire camp.

And I don‚Äôt like calling it camp. It‚Äôs basically college.

I go to breakfast at 8, have class until lunch, then some free time, then another class, then a tiny bit of free time before dinner, then class until 10.

It‚Äôs SO FUN. I‚Äôm learning so much. A lot of people think some of the stuff is boring but this is the stuff I LIVE for.

Today was the first normal day with classes. I feel like I‚Äôve been here a week already and it‚Äôs only the second day.

Most of my classes are kind of dull, but my printmaking course is FUCKING AWESOME.

When we walked in for the first time for class today at 6 I almost had a happy anxiety attack.

I could not stop grinning. The space is GORGEOUS. I‚Äôd share a pic but like privacy and shit. There is beautiful lighting and I get MY OWN DESK. My own tiny studio.

My instructor is SO COOL/CHILL.

F knows him and sometimes teaches a class at the college in the same department. I saw a paper racked up to the wall that was totally from one of his workshops.

When I was texting F, he said to tell (printmaking instructor) hi.

You never know if people mean it or not when they say that.

I didn‚Äôt say that to my instructor tonight. I‚Äôm just gonna call him R.

R is so cool. Printmaking is so cool. I think I am in love with it. We sat down and all said our names and shit and why we picked printmaking/ what experience we‚Äôve had.

I dropped some big fancy words like relief printing, silkscreen, intaglio processes. I saw his face kind of give an impressed look.

So that was cool.

We didn‚Äôt do much, but yet we did a lot. I mixed my inks perfectly and applied them better than everyone else. Kept my paper clean. And OH MY GOD. Working in a print studio is SO much more efficient.

I‚Äôm kind of nervous. I really want R to like me. Especially if I‚Äôm going to be going to school here and majoring in printmaking and he being one of my primary teachers.

If I tell him I‚Äôm one of F‚Äôs students, maybe he‚Äôll be nicer. Idk.

But it seems like I already know how to do what we are going to be doing. I can‚Äôt wait until he lets us go to do whatever we want to make.

My goal is to impress his ass and be the best high school printmaker he‚Äôs ever seen.

Anyways. My RA is doing bed checks so I should probably go turn out the light. The RA‚Äôs are chill

0,"08.07.19. High with my sister
My sister and I held hands as we walked through the ravine with my friend after the three of us got high.

We were talking about how little we see each other.

I said: ‚ÄúWe should hang out more.‚Äù

My sister said: ‚ÄúWe should!‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWant to come up and visit me?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYes! When? That sounds great!‚Äù

I turned to my friend with the dopiest grin on my face.

My friend said: ‚ÄúYou guys are cute.‚Äù

My sister smiled and put her head on my shoulder.

I lay my head on top.

And we walked like that, with slightly crooked heads and our hands intertwined, through the darkness."
0,"Okay.
So we broke up. He decided the nice thing to do was just pack up all my shit and throw it in garbage bags. To ""help"" because I guess I am too lazy to do so myself.

He still won't admit to any of his fuck ups. I deserved it all because I wasn't his little maid following him all around the house cleaning up after him. I'm sorry I thought a 29 year old ""man"" could do that himself.

I really like quotations today.

My daughter and I are spending the night at his place again. And all he has done since I've been here is add little jabs to everything. Yes. I know. My fault for putting myself back into a toxic environment I am trying to leave. But I will not keep my daughter from him.

I'm rambling again.

I guess the moral of this is he is a good dad but a super shitty person (to me at least). I can't believe I allowed all this bullshit to go on for so long."
0,"08.07.19. The kids return
My sister and the two youngest kids got back home today.

We were all pretty excited to see each other.

It was nice to have some time with them before I leave again tomorrow.

Once the baby went to bed, the five year old got lots of special attention, since she was the only kid here.

She *loved* it.

And I loved getting to give it to her.

But like always, I noticed some stuff happening that made me worried.

Like, when my dad walked in the door.

She looked at me, eyes wide, and whispered: ‚ÄúWe have to hide!‚Äù

Then she ran off to hide in the corner, sucking her thumb as she sat silently.

It gave me a pit in my stomach.

...Especially since she‚Äôs the kid who has a lot of the same symptoms I had at that age.

And something bad happened to me at that age.

Then my aunt walked in to talk to my mom.

The five year old burst out with a big grin and said: ‚ÄúHi mom!‚Äù

No response.

She tried again: ‚ÄúHi mom!‚Äù

Nothing.

She said: ‚ÄúMom!‚Äù

That got my aunt‚Äôs attention.

She looked her daughter right in the eyes.

Didn‚Äôt react in the slightest.

Then she turned back to my mom and kept talking.

The five year old‚Äôs shoulders slumped.

I tried to give her a hug, but she didn‚Äôt want one.

...Or at least, not from me.

Then all the adults left for dinner.

The five year old said: ‚ÄúBut you went out last night! Can‚Äôt you stay here with me?‚Äù

My uncle told her: ‚ÄúSometimes grownups like time alone. Stop whining, and be good for your cousins.‚Äù

Then they left.

And my sister, my cousin and I were alone.

We had a good time.

She‚Äôs a really cute kid.

I taught her how to play guitar.

She said I could write her a song if I wanted.

(I‚Äôm working on it now.)

And my sister is joining me later to get high with my friends, which will be fun.

But, it just makes me sad sometimes.

I wish I could protect them forever.

But I can‚Äôt."
0,"08.07.19. Those high talks
Last night, my friend and I went to a weed caf√©.

We bought edibles and some fancy dispensary bud.

The we got some regular ice cream bars from the corner store across the street, and found a quiet place to sit and smoke under the stars.

We sat on the steps outside a high school.

It was a specialized art high school, so there were all these gorgeous strips of glowing light that changed colours built into all the concrete structures.

(Those were *awesome* once we were high.)

Then we just stayed there, and talked.

My friend told me her parents love me, and don‚Äôt mind having me over all the time.

That was really nice to hear.

I figured I‚Äôd overstated my welcome- last summer, I spent almost every night on their couch.

But it turns out, they like having me around.

We talked about lots of other things, too.

She told me all about how miserable she is in her program. How little she has figured out.

(There was more, but I won‚Äôt write about it here. It‚Äôs not my place to publicize her story.)

I told her about how unmotivated I‚Äôve been, too.

How I was passionate and excited about coding, but my degree has turned into mostly math.

I told her how much I fucking hate math.

She said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking all night about your old job at that charity place. Your face lights up when you mention volunteering at the cat shelter.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with non-profit work... other than the lifestyle! Haha.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. And if it was just for me, I don‚Äôt really care about money. But my dad...‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYour dad cares about how much money you‚Äôll make?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs the thing. He doesn‚Äôt, and neither of my parents have ever expected me to be successful the way they are. So... that‚Äôs it? I don‚Äôt want them to be right. I don‚Äôt want to be the failure they think I am.‚Äù

She raised her eyebrows.

She said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone is ever going to be as successful as your dad.‚Äù

I had never thought about that before.

She said: ‚ÄúNo one expects you to be the CEO of an international, multi-billion dollar company.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs million.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúGod, who gives a shit? You‚Äôre not a failure if you don‚Äôt end up a multi-billion or million-aire.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI kind of am, though. Usually, kids in my place don‚Äôt go to school. They just work for their dads and eventually take over the family business. If I did that, I would be successful, too.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThen do that.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to do that! I already turned my dad down. Now he‚Äôs trying to snag my brother.‚Äù

She giggled, exhaling smoke through her nose.

She said: ‚ÄúYour life is ridiculous.‚Äù

I giggled, too.

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with following your passion, even if it‚Äôs riskier. And it‚Äôs not a bad thing that you want to build your own future instead of just abusing your privilege forever.‚Äù

I took a harsh hit, and coughed.

When I could breathe again, I said: ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre kind of blowing my mind right now.‚Äù

She laughed.

She said: ‚ÄúYeah, dude, you don‚Äôt have to want lots of money. It‚Äôs ok to want to help people.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúBlech. Is that really all I am - nice? I don‚Äôt want the only thing I‚Äôm good for to be putting others before myself! What a stupid job.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúOh nooo, being *nice*. Devoting your life to helping others- gross! What a horrible way to live.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúIt *is* a horrible way to live! And at family reunions everyone else will be staring down at me from their mansions that they bought with their good, selfish, high-paying jobs while I roll up from my one-bedroom studio apartment that I share with six cats!‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be a good person.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a poor person.‚Äù

She took a puff from the pipe.

On the exhale, she said: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll love it.‚Äù

As she spoke, the smoke curled out her mouth, the pale tendrils contrasting against the darkness.

She said: ‚ÄúAnd at the end of the day, when you get back to your rundown studio apartment to feed your six cats, you‚Äôll be satisfied.‚Äù

I watched the smoke drift up towards the stars, her words blowing away with the wind.

She said: ‚ÄúYou might be broke, but...‚Äù

She paused to take a hit.

She breathed it in, leaned back, and gave a long exhale, a thick cloud flying out her mouth into the air.

Then she turned back to me.

‚Äú...You‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù"
0,"07.07.19. Holy shit, I met a boy
It was an accident, I swear.

This was never supposed to happen.

My housemate has a crush on a different boy, a boy who likes her back.

So she planned a ‚Äúgroup date‚Äù.

It was really just an excuse for the two of them to go on a date without having to admit that‚Äôs what they wanted or be alone together.

I didn‚Äôt want to go.

But she really wanted me there, so we came to a compromise.

We would invite this guy - the least likely kind of guy to like me like that - to be my date.

He‚Äôs the kind of guy that has a reputation.

I‚Äôm the kind of girl that doesn‚Äôt.

So I agreed to go.

Why wouldn‚Äôt I?

I had nothing to worry about. I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be interested in me.

And our town gets pretty boring in the summer.

My housemate wasn‚Äôt even being serious when she suggested him. But it was just ridiculous enough to work.

We thought it would make for a funny story in case things didn‚Äôt work out between her and her date.

I couldn‚Äôt even ask him myself- I didn‚Äôt have his contact info.

My housemate had to ask if he‚Äôd be willing to tag along as my date for one night.

He said sure.

Why wouldn‚Äôt he?

He had nothing to worry about. He knew I wouldn‚Äôt be interested in him.

And our town gets pretty boring in the summer.

He probably thought it would make for a funny story to tell at work.

My housemate promised: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt leave you alone with him. You‚Äôll be safe.‚Äù

But I was still nervous.

I made it very clear I had no interest in him.

When he got there, he asked me and my housemate: ‚ÄúSo... is this a real date?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

My housemate said: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

(Her date was standing nearby.)

I said: ‚Äú*No.*‚Äù

She said: ‚Äú*Yes!*‚Äù

My date said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused.‚Äù

I motioned at my housemate and her date, and told him: ‚ÄúThis whole thing is an excuse for these two to get together. We‚Äôre NPCs. So... grab a balloon.‚Äù

(The first part of the date was a water balloon fight.)

He said: ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre just wingmen?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúPretty much.‚Äù

And I popped a water balloon right in his face.

He said: ‚ÄúHey! I thought we‚Äôre supposed to be on the same team!‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

And I popped another one.

The look on his dripping wet face was priceless.

But after that, I got the message.

I figured if he was nice enough to accompany me, I should be nice enough to make sure we both had a half-decent time.

I am a bit of a pessimist- I knew I should at least *try* to go in with a good attitude.

What was the point of going if not to have fun?

So I said: ‚ÄúTruce?‚Äù

And he shook my hand.

Then we tag-teamed my housemate, pounding her with water balloons from every direction... except the one leading directly to her date, of course.

It ended up being a lot of fun.

Turns out, we have the same sense of humour.

At some point, one of our jokes turned into fake-flirting with each other, since we were fake-dates.

We thought it was funny, and it kept us entertained.

But then my housemate and I went off by ourselves to ‚Äúget something‚Äù and debrief.

I told her: ‚ÄúI have a pit in my stomach.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThen stop flirting with him!‚Äù

And I realized that somehow, our fun little joke had stopped being a joke.

We were flirting for real.

But I knew he was just toying with me, so it didn‚Äôt stress me out as much as I thought it would.

It wasn‚Äôt like he really wanted to do anything with me.

He was just bored because he was on this stupid group date with us and had nothing else to do.

Plus, it was fun.

I haven‚Äôt flirted in forever.

Especially not with someone like him.

And up close, he‚Äôs a lot nicer than his reputation gives him credit for.

So when we wanted to get high, and no one else in the group wanted to come, I didn‚Äôt think twice about going off alone with him.

We were only supposed to stay out in my backyard for a few minutes to smoke, then go right back in with the group.

But we stayed out so long, the others made dinner without us, and had to send someone out to get us.

We said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right in.‚Äù

But then we forgot, and just kept talking.

Eventually, the group gave in, and brought a table and folding chairs out to the backyard.

And we all ate together, under the stars.

But then the weed wore off.

So him and I went off on our own again, to the front yard this time.

But then he got too high, and needed a few minutes alone before he could socialize with everyone again.

And just like that, we were alone in my room.

He sat in the chair, and I sat on the bed.

There was lots of space between us.

We just talked.

He told me he doesn‚Äôt do hookups anymore, that he‚Äôs taking time to work on himself.

I told him I‚Äôm doing the same.

He asked me why, and I told him about the sketchy situation I got in last year, and how it gave me anxiety.

He took it better than I would have expected from a guy like him.

We called it ‚Äúmy tragic backstory‚Äù.

Then my friend came in to grab something.

(Later, she told me it was actually just to check on my safety, because of his history. She‚Äôs the best! <3)

On her way out, she left the door open.

(In hindsight, probably on purpose.)

So he got out of the chair and closed it.

Something about wanting to keep the fan air in the room, instead of blowing out.

...Like I was gonna believe that.

When he came back, he sat on the bed.

Right next to me.

My heart started beating, in a good way.

Our arms were touching, and we would playfully lean up against each other as we talked.

I added him on Snapchat.

He sent me a picture.

I sent him one back- an ugly one that I caught of him, really zoomed in. I drew a pedo-stache on it.

As I giggled, he looked over and saw it.

He said: ‚ÄúOh, no way!‚Äù

Then he pounced, wrestling to get the phone out of my hand.

And I started to understand his reputation a bit more.

He was strong, and he didn‚Äôt hold back.

He pinned me to the bed, hard.

Then he straddled me.

He leaned in.

I could feel his whole weight on top of me.

He had one of my arms held over my head.

My heart was beating- not in a good way.

Suddenly, I was reminded of another time I was pinned to the bed.

I could feel a different boy‚Äôs hand pressed against my wrist, holding me down.

My mind went blank. I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I said: ‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù

The smile left his face, but he did.

And we sat up, and I muttered: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hook up. Sorry. I just... sorry.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt- I was just playing around, I didn‚Äôt- uh, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean to completely ruin this relation- uh, friendship. We should still hang out!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ruin anything.‚Äù

Then, we stayed and talked some more.

...It was more awkward this time.

And there was less touching.

But he said: ‚ÄúWe should definitely still hang out again. I‚Äôd be cool as friends or something more.‚Äù

And I said: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we start off as friends and see what happens?‚Äù

He said that sounded good.

Five minutes after he left my house, he sent me a Snapchat, and we immediately started flirting.

We‚Äôve been Snapchatting all weekend.

We have plans to go the gym together when I get back from home.

How did this happen?

He‚Äôs *dangerous*.

Not in a hot, clich√© way.

(Well, kind of exactly in that way.)

My friend asked me what his reputation is, and all I knew to say is: ‚ÄúHe hits women.‚Äù

We have a lot in common. He‚Äôs been in sketchy situations before, too, just like me.

...But he‚Äôs usually on the other end of them.

But he said he‚Äôs trying to change.

And when someone offered wine, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drinking tonight.‚Äù

(He only gets violent when he‚Äôs drunk.)

And he got off me when I told him to.

He even said it was fine that I didn‚Äôt wanna hook up.

He‚Äôs still talking to me even though I didn‚Äôt do anything with him.

(...But did that just make him want me more?)

My friends told me to go for it... but to stay in public.

I can‚Äôt believe I like a guy who I can‚Äôt even be left alone with.

I can‚Äôt *believe* I fell for the one guy I thought I could never, ever fall for.

But rumours aren‚Äôt always true.

He didn‚Äôt give me any reason to believe he‚Äôll hurt me, and I‚Äôm literally always looking for them.

It seems unfair to not even give him a chance.

I‚Äôm still nervous, obviously.

I don‚Äôt know what he wants from me, or what he‚Äôs capable of.

But we had a really good time together.

He got off me when I told him to.

And he‚Äôs *cute*.

(I haven‚Äôt been able to feel attracted to anyone for a while. I wasn‚Äôt even attracted to him, at first.)

When I think of him, I start grinning like a schoolgirl.

And I haven‚Äôt stopped smiling all weekend.

I can‚Äôt get him off my mind.

I *hate* that I like him.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt.

...But I do."

Something weird is going on.

...I think my parents might love me.

I went home this weekend, because my mom was worried about me and wanted to take care of me.

(Weird.)

All the kids are away at summer camp, except my sister, who‚Äôs staying at her boyfriend‚Äôs, and the two youngest ones, who are up north with their parents.

So I‚Äôm the only one home.

It‚Äôs just me and my parents.

(Weird.)

They spent all day paying attention to me.

(...Weirder.)

My dad even took me to the mall for a shopping spree. He said I could spend as much as I want as long as everything was in my size.

(That one‚Äôs actually not weird. My dad always shows how much he loves me with money and presents.)

Usually, I size up two or three sizes, or just buy men‚Äôs clothing. But my dad said I have a good figure and I should show it off more.

(Weird.)

That made me a little uncomfortable, since I don‚Äôt like to be too exposed. But he was nice about it, and didn‚Äôt make me buy anything too revealing.

(...Weird.)

My mom wanted to come, too, but my dad didn‚Äôt let her. He told her: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll make it all about you.‚Äù

My mom agreed, and decided not to come.

(,..Weirder.)

Apparently, today was supposed to be all about me.

(*...Weird!!*)

So I bought a whole bunch of new, well-fitting clothes.

My dad and I even got lunch together.

We spent an hour just talking, catching up and getting to know each other.

(...Weird.)

Turns out, I like my dad.

(Weirder!)

When we got home, we showed all the clothes to my mom. We spent an hour in my room just hanging out and looking at my clothes.

(Weird!)

Both of them kept telling me I looked good.

(Weird!! What the fuck?)

They gave me lots of hugs.

(Weird.)

My dad didn‚Äôt even touch my back! He almost did a few times- but stopped when I flinched. Every time!

(WEIRD.)

Then we ate dinner together.

(Weird.)

Just the three of us.

(Weirder.)

I did most of the talking.

(WEIRDER.)

It was... really nice.

(WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.)

Later, my mom wants to watch TV with me, since she missed out on spending time with me today.

(Weird!!!)

And then I‚Äôm going out to get high with my friends.

(That one‚Äôs not weird. I‚Äôm just excited.)

My parents were so nice to me, all day.

There were no kids around to take care of or worry about or get in the way of my plans.

Nobody tried to hurt me or make me do anything I didn‚Äôt want to or touch me when I said no.

They just listened to me, and paid attention to me, and acted like they cared about me.

It was weird.

But, good weird.

I feel... loved.

(Weird.)

...By my *parents*.

(WEIRD.)

Is this what my whole life could have been like?

(Fuck- talk about weird.)

I know better than to get used to this.

I know how quickly things can fall apart.

And the kids won‚Äôt be gone forever.

Everything will be back to normal soon.

But they‚Äôre trying, and that means a lot.

I‚Äôm not going to forget my parents‚Äô kindness, or take their effort for granted.

I had a really nice day.

...At *home*.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been so lazy in writing.

The last three days have been 50% sleeping, and 50% trying not to fall asleep from heat exhaustion.

I still feel like I‚Äôm not awake. But I‚Äôve got three more hours in the car until I get home. Thought I‚Äôd update my diary a bit.

I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to my great grandma. I feel so guilty. I told my dad we did so we didn‚Äôt have to turn around.

I can‚Äôt imagine being 93. She still walks around her little ‚Äúhouse‚Äù just fine. She hates using her walker but she will when she goes out. She‚Äôs a bit hard on hearing but she still talks up a storm.

I helped her with a computer thing. She couldn‚Äôt figure out how to close out tabs. When I showed her she looked at me like I was a hero.

I hope this wasn‚Äôt the last time I‚Äôll ever see her.

I‚Äôve been listening to the Black Keys new album ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Rock‚Äù on repeat this weekend. I LOVE it. I don‚Äôt know if I love it because it‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs not my favorite of their albums, but I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre back together after 5 years.

I watched a YouTube video months ago that said they had disbanded with little hope for new music.

It‚Äôs not as hardcore as I expected but I kind of like it. It‚Äôs kind of peaceful.

Anyways I spent the last three days at our families little town in the middle of nowhere. It‚Äôs not OUR town, but my grandpa grew up there and so did his parents and their parents moved there I think. My dad spent time in the summer there as a kid.

It was nice to spend time with my second cousins and their dad. They‚Äôre a lot friendlier than I remembered. The kids aren‚Äôt as hyper as I remembered. It‚Äôs kind of sad because I see myself becoming more boring as the years go on too.

Today before they left I got his number, and his wife and the oldest boy. Hopefully we will spend more time together in the future. It‚Äôs nice knowing I‚Äôve got other kids in the family.

My grandparents weren‚Äôt as annoying as I expected. They were a bit but it was okay.

They made me draw a picture of an old photo of a tire shop that belonged to someone in our family a while back. It sold at the fundraising auction today for $125. I can‚Äôt believe it. I wish everything I spent time on could make $125.

Sadly I don‚Äôt get to keep any of the money. Not even to reimburse me for the frame. Oh well. Guess that was my contribution.

The sun is beating down on the back of my head. My flat hair is hot. I hope I don‚Äôt get sunburnt.

There are so many cows. It seems like every time I look out the window there is a beard of cows. The plains out here are pretty flat. No y‚Äôall trees. Fields of wheat and corn. The corn hasn‚Äôt been doing good this year because of the rain.

As we drive east the land gradually gets a little less flat and some more trees. Less cows too.

While driving around town yesterday we drove by a huge cattle farm with over 70,000 cows. It was literally cows as far as you could see. Big rectangle dogs.

Cows are hilarious.

We‚Äôre not supposed to get back home until 9:00 ish.

I‚Äôll have to shower, and do my skin routine because my skin has just soaked in bug spray, sweat, and dirt all weekend. Fix my nails. Spray my sandals clean from the dust and mud that‚Äôs caked in the crevices.

I have to finish packing. I leave tomorrow morning for my art camp. I seriously can‚Äôt wait to be gone for three weeks.

AND OH MY GOD.

I rarely think about F. I‚Äôm glad my obsession wasn‚Äôt too bad. But I messaged him out of the blue yesterday because I wanted to see if there were any updates on the Santa Fe trip.

I‚Äôm really worried it‚Äôs not going to happen at all, or at least in October. Anyways. I also mentioned if he wanted the details for the exhibition at the end of the camp.

‚ÄúOf course! I‚Äôd love to come to the show. Please let me know. Have fun!! And say hi to (art professor) for me.‚Äù

I said ‚ÄúI sure will. He‚Äôll probably be there on the exhibition night too‚Äù

Then he said ‚ÄúYeah I will really try to go. I want to see what you make!‚Äù

Then I jokingly said ‚ÄúThe pressure is on haha‚Äù

To which he replied, ‚ÄúNah. No pressure! Just do your thing, don‚Äôt compare yourself to anyone else, have fun and soak up as much as you can. F. U. N. is the word. It‚Äôll be awesome!‚Äù

I hope he didn‚Äôt think I was being too serious although I do feel a lot of pressure.

But the biggest pressure is to do good in front of the college. I need to make a good impression so I can get better scholarships.

Oh my god I‚Äôm so excited. He said he actually wants to go and is excited to see what I make. He is too good to me. I don‚Äôt know where I would be without his support. ‚Äî certainly not going to the camp in the first place.

I can‚Äôt wait to see him on the 26th. A whole 20 days away.

I need to text him and tell him more details regarding the date and time and place of the exhibition. I figure I‚Äôll wait till I‚Äôve gotten to campus.

I am SO excited aaaaaaah.

The land is so beautiful out here. Overall it looks kind of bland but the beautiful mixtures of wildflowers and tallgrass is breathtaking. You can see forever and the sky is so vast.

0,"06.07.19. Not what it sounds like
Right when I got back the next morning, I got a text from one of my friends wondering where I was.

I was late to help clean the dorm room we had trashed the night before. They told me to get my butt over there ASAP.

When I got there, they asked me where I had gone after I left them last night.

Laughing, I told the details I remembered.

I wondered if they would be proud of me, for getting so much action. At the very least, I hoped I had enough details to make for an interesting story.

But no one laughed.

Everyone just kind of looked at me.

Then one of them said: ‚ÄúThat sounds like gang rape.‚Äù

And another said: ‚ÄúYeah, are you ok?‚Äù

I scoffed.

I said: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt *rape*, guys. Don‚Äôt be dramatic.‚Äù

And we never talked about it again.

But when I went back to my room later, I thought about what my friend said.

And I remember feeling so relieved.

I thought: *Thank god. That one was finally bad enough- I can stop now.*

How can it be rape if I felt relieved after?

It wasn‚Äôt gang rape.

It was just an excuse for me to stop having sex.

But it wasn‚Äôt *rape.*

I was just tired of getting hurt all the time.

But I was lying.

It wasn‚Äôt really rape."

Ever since me and the girl broke up, I‚Äôve needed to recharge my emotions and get back into a good path. Had a 4 day, got invited to Croatia and denied it. Friday night a friend came over we smoked some hookah we had good laughs and ended up cuddling in bed. I didn‚Äôt take it any farther because I knew what I was doing. I was just trying to distract myself and get the ex outta my head. Got invited to Milan today and I also denied it. Making a stupid excuse. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to be social right now. It takes a lot keeping a fake smile on my face. I‚Äôve been watching friends all weekend and it makes me laugh but after a couple moments I go back to my sad little hole. This is really the only place I come to, to express how I truly feel. I don‚Äôt want any of my friends back home thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with me. There is but I don‚Äôt wanna worry them. 10 more days until I go back home. Best friends wife is having a bbq. Which doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea until you realize her bff is my ex girlfriend. So bbq should be awkward. I won‚Äôt drink because I know how I get when I do. I know it‚Äôs gonna hurt seeing her again. In the back of my mind tho, there‚Äôs this stupid hope that we might talk things out and work on us. But I know from prior experiences that that‚Äôs not how it works. Just hopeless hope.
Going back to friends now. Hope y‚Äôall had a good weekend!"

I‚Äôm so annoyed with Greg. I never get annoyed with him. We talked about it because we really do have great communication but I‚Äôm still mad. I‚Äôm almost wondering if cigarettes are contributing to my poor attitude about the situation or if i actually feel this way. I‚Äôm so hurt. He constantly has to nap and it‚Äôs because he literally just wants to. But you know I get that. We have the same mental illness‚Äô and I get that you have to have a depression nap sometimes I do too. But when you sleep 12 hours a day and stay up till 3 am it‚Äôs hard to spend a lot of time with you without me having to stay up SUPER late or have to nap to spend time with you and it hurts it fucking hurts so bad I just went from angry to sad and I guess that‚Äôs what i really feel.

I got interested in all the things you are, you even showed interest in things I really like recently but I‚Äôm still hurting so bad. So what? Am I just depressed?

Ok, so I *do* have PTSD.

But I don‚Äôt think I was gang raped.

*Something* happened.

I didn‚Äôt try to kill myself for fun.

I did it because I was sent into a depressive spiral after what happened.

But... what happened?

I‚Äôm not comfortable saying I was raped.

That feels like lying.

Really, I don‚Äôt know what happened.

I don‚Äôt remember most of it.

But I‚Äôm missing chunks of time from all throughout my life. And I‚Äôm missing chunks of time from that night, too.

The internet said that‚Äôs a symptom of repressed memories.

Repressed memories are a sign that something bad happened.

But... what happened?

I‚Äôve always said it was gang rape, like I was so sure.

But that was just me covering up my insecurity.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt know what really happened.

And that scares the shit out of me.

Because what if I said yes and I just don‚Äôt remember?

What if I liked it?

And if I don‚Äôt even remember it, why did it affect me so much? I shouldn‚Äôt have PTSD from something I don‚Äôt even know really happened.

If I‚Äôm gonna be this messed up from it, I figured I might as well act like it really did happen.

But it didn‚Äôt.

*Something* happened.

But probably not something that counts as gang rape.

Am I a bad person for lying?

This all started because of something I heard on a podcast.

I really need to stop listening to stupid fucking podcasts until I get all my shit worked out.

There was a girl on this podcast who lied about being gang raped as an adult because she was molested as a kid and didn‚Äôt know how to deal with it.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I did, too.

Maybe I exaggerated what happened on St. Patty‚Äôs to seem worse than it really was, because I had never told anyone about what happened when I was little.

And I finally had a way to get my feelings out, and to get the help I needed.

I lied when I said I‚Äôve never been raped.

I have.

But I also lied when I said I was gang raped.

It was just one person who used those words to describe it, when I told him the details I remembered from that night.

And I let his words get in my head and shape my opinions and feelings of what happened.

But it makes me feel like a liar to say it.

I *was* raped.

But the real story is too hard to talk about.

It‚Äôs too hard to even *think* about.

And I wonder how much of what I felt towards the ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù really had to do with what actually happened that night.

It‚Äôs not like I reported it or told anyone other than a few close friends about what happened.

But I wonder if maybe those boys got the brunt of some strong feelings that maybe they didn‚Äôt deserve.

It might have just been group sex I couldn‚Äôt handle.

And I‚Äôm sorry I called it rape before I was certain.

Because I‚Äôm not certain.

I‚Äôm not certain about anything.

Some days I feel like everything is real.

But some days, I feel like I made everything up.

My entire life feels pretend.

So much shit has happened.

How can it all be real?

It can‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs too much.

And I think what happened just pushed me over the edge, and that‚Äôs why I broke.

But it wasn‚Äôt *really* gang rape.

I just can‚Äôt believe I got PTSD from a lie."

It didn‚Äôt happen.

I don‚Äôt have PTSD.

How can I?

I‚Äôve never really experienced rape.

Well, I guess I was molested.

...Unless I just made that up, too.

And even then, being molested isn‚Äôt like being raped.

And making it all up *definitely* isn‚Äôt like being raped.

I can‚Äôt imagine what being raped is really like.

I don‚Äôt have any memories of it happening.

I‚Äôm just a selfish, privileged, spoiled, sheltered piece of shit who made stuff up for attention and excuses.

I‚Äôve had it easy.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really like to be broken.

I haven‚Äôt suffered the way a real survivor has.

How *dare* I say that happened to me?

What the *fuck* is wrong with me?

Yes, I tried to kill myself.

Yes, I cut for months.

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for a year.

Yes, I was dependent on drugs.

Yes, I engaged in reckless behaviour.

Yes, I put myself in dangerous situations.

Yes, I felt too unsafe to leave the house.

Yes, I had nightmares.

Yes, I felt pretend.

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

Yes, I had panic attacks.

(But they weren‚Äôt *bad* panic attacks. Nothing like the one my housemate had.)

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying.

Yes, I isolated myself from friends and family.

Yes, I was afraid of men.

...I was afraid of everyone.

Yes, I didn‚Äôt feel safe- no matter where I went.

Yes, I stopped going out.

Yes, I was afraid of groups.

Yes, I can‚Äôt get turned on anymore.

Yes, sex makes me feel disgusting.

Yes, I don‚Äôt like people touching me anymore.

(Especially my back.)

But that was all just regular anxiety.

I wasn‚Äôt *raped*.

...But I don‚Äôt have an anxiety disorder.

The testing lady said so.

Could it all be just regular depression?

I thought it was caused by undiagnosed ADHD- that would explain the impulsive behaviour and why I couldn‚Äôt focus and my strong emotions.

...But I don‚Äôt have ADHD.

Can depression explain all that, too?

It probably can.

I probably just have regular depression.

The part that doesn‚Äôt make sense is that I have all the symptoms of PTSD.

So what caused all those symptoms?

I read PTSD can be caused by false memories in rare cases. Is that what happened to me?

...No, that can‚Äôt be it, either.

Because false memories feel real, and this feels fake.

It *is* fake.

I made it up.

I don‚Äôt have PTSD.

How can I?

There‚Äôs a lava lamp in my room.

It‚Äôs almost always on. At night, it illuminates everything with its bright blue glow.

Light bugs my eyes when I‚Äôm trying to sleep.

So tonight, I walked over to the lava lamp.

Fumbled for the power box on its cord.

Turned the little wheel ‚Äòtil it clicked.

And my room went dark.

For a second, I just stood there, in total darkness.

Then I clicked the wheel again, and my room lit up with that familiar, brilliant blue.

I was busy pitying myself when my housemate came into my room, just curious how I was handling the heat.

(Not well.)

Even though he just had one question, he ended up staying for half an hour, just rambling on about anime.

He‚Äôs nice to listen to.

Sometimes, he just goes on these extended rants about anime I haven‚Äôt seen, or video games I haven‚Äôt played, or anything about Dungeons and Dragons.

(I just don‚Äôt like Dungeons and Dragons. No hate, it‚Äôs just not for me.)

But even though all I can do during his rambles is smile and nod along, I still like hearing them.

Once he realized I‚Äôm actually listening, he lets his excitement get the better of him.

He just comes alive.

He could talk about all that stuff forever if I only had the attention span.

I asked him if he wanted to watch anime with me downstairs where it‚Äôs air conditioned, even though we didn‚Äôt have plans to watch TV together today.

So he made popcorn and I grabbed a bowl of raspberries and my unicorn pillow, and we settled in on the couch.

We watched for hours.

By the time we were finished, I felt way better.

Like, even my leg hurts less.

He brought me back, and he didn‚Äôt even try.

He didn‚Äôt even know!

We don‚Äôt talk about stuff like that, which I prefer.

This was just a good time, simple as that.

When we were finished, my other housemate came downstairs and sat with us, too.

She went on her phone, and the other opened his laptop, and I lay down on the couch to rest.

And I realized my head didn‚Äôt feel so foggy anymore.

The horrible feeling that I thought was unfixable had lifted. I felt way better than I did only a few hours ago.

With my eyes closed, I listened as we each got lost in our own little worlds, sitting around the coffee table.

And I thought: *This is how it should be.*

All of us together.

It‚Äôs easier to lose yourself when you know someone will be there to find you.

With them around, I can let go a little.

They keep me here.

They ground me."

I‚Äôm tired.

I was up until 3am last night.

Couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I got high- which triggered one of the worst anxiety attacks I‚Äôve ever had.

I walked all the way to the hospital before I realized what a bad idea that was, and went back home.

I literally thought I was going to die.

For hours, I stayed up, panicking on and off.

There was just this feeling that if I went to sleep, I would never wake back up again.

Going to sleep felt like deciding to die.

But then, I stopped caring.

And I almost slept right through my blood test today.

This one was worse than last time.

One of my veins blew out because it was still fragile from the last needle.

Then the nurse flipped me upside down with no warning so I wouldn‚Äôt pass out.

I freaked out and made her put me back up.

Then I got a whole battery of needles.

I needed lots of tests.

There‚Äôs a lot wrong with me.

By the time it was over, I was drained- literally. (Lol!)

I was calmer this time, but I think it‚Äôs just because I was too woozy and tired to fight back.

Then I had to walk back home with those stupid cotton bandaids on both arms.

She said I had to keep them on for 15 minutes.

*So* embarrassing.

Everyone could see I needed tests in both arms!

I bet they could tell how pathetic I was.

I wish I didn‚Äôt need stupid bandaids.

We stopped at Tim Horton‚Äôs so I could get an ice coffee and some food before I passed out.

I wonder if anyone thought I was wearing the bandaids for attention.

The guy I rejected yesterday found something on the internet about how I used to self harm for attention.

He also dug up some other stuff about me, like how I got an impulse tattoo.

He sent me a text about it calling me an idiot.

Then he told me to ‚Äúget fukked‚Äù.

What a dumbass.

He was probably just hurting.

But I wish he hadn‚Äôt violated my privacy like that.

Not that anything he did was out of character.

I should have known better than to give him enough information to find that stuff in the first place. It just didn‚Äôt even occur to me that he would look.

God, he‚Äôs such a nuisance.

I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over now.

...I hope.

I bought my housemate a donut for coming with me to the doctor.

She said it was nothing, and to stop thanking her.

I‚Äôm so grateful she puts up with me.

We saw a dog outside the coffee place, which was fun. We got to pet it.

It was so cute!

Then we went home and I collapsed on the couch with my unicorn pillow.

My stomach hurts from cramps.

My head hurts from the heat.

My arm hurts from my stupid vein collapsing.

Even my leg hurts, from my injury flaring up a few days ago. Ugh. Sometimes I wish I could just cut it off.

I took Advil but it didn‚Äôt help.

I hate being like this.

I feel broken.

And useless.

Stupid fucking blood test.

I *hate* the doctor!"
0,"03.07.19. Just a normal diary entry
Man, I had a full day today!

I had four online quizzes due that I forgot about, so the first two hours of my day were rough while I did those.

Then, I rejected someone.

(That‚Äôs a story that deserves its own post. It‚Äôs still too complicated for me to put into words what happened yet, but when it‚Äôs completely over I‚Äôll be able to put the story together- and behind me.)

My housemate and I ordered fast food for lunch and ate it on my bedroom floor while we had an extensive talk about rape and mental illness.

I‚Äôm so grateful to have someone like her, who I can talk to about all this shit. It really helps.

I finally did my laundry!

I‚Äôve been putting it off for an obscene amount of time. I literally didn‚Äôt have a single shirt left in my closet.

Putting on a fresh t-shirt straight out of the dryer is the one of the best feelings ever.

Then I went to my math tutor‚Äôs house, since him and his wife invited me over for dinner again.

It was so much fun!

We ordered sushi and smoked a few bowls out on their plant-covered balcony and watched anime and played with their cat.

His wife even made raspberry cheesecake!

...From scratch!!

They‚Äôre such good, interesting people.

(Not because of the cheesecake. But that, too!)

I hope they invite me over again- I really enjoy their company. I hope they like mine, too.

I can never tell if people want me around or if they want me gone, especially when I like them.

But I hope I was a good guest.

(Or at least a neutral one- I don‚Äôt want to be rude!)

They were really good hosts.

I accidentally stayed until 10:30pm!

So I had to walk home, alone, in the dark.

Through places full of everything that scares me.

Shadowy corners, strange rustling noises, the occasional man wandering by.

(I always cross the street when I see one.)

Through *campus*.

Bleh.

Going onto campus always fills me with a sense of dread. I feel it everywhere; through my whole body.

I‚Äôve been working really hard on my anxiety, so I‚Äôm a lot calmer than I used to be when I go there.

But the pit in my stomach doesn‚Äôt leave until I do.

Even after I get home, the feeling stays with me sometimes. I have to force myself to relax.

Anyways, now I‚Äôm home and in bed and exhausted.

But not exhausted in my usual, depressed way.

I‚Äôm just worn out, because I did a lot.

It feels good.

It feels *normal*.

I wish every day could feel like this.

And hey- I finally made a normal diary entry!

Now that I have people who always ask me how my day was, I‚Äôve gotten better at sharing the details.

I used to not know how.

But it gets easier with practise.

I‚Äôm so grateful to have people who taught me how to share. I can‚Äôt believe how lucky I am!

I hope I‚Äôm worth listening to."

My life is about to be insane

I woke up at 7 and worked on a packing list all morning. I started gathering all my things together.

Even started on that stupid drawing.

I showed my dad and he was very unimpressed. It kind of hurts sometimes.

I went out to lunch and went to shop for last minute camp stuff at target with grandma.

And I did two loads of laundry. Packed some more.

Went to church, I recorded the sermon for Ali because she was gone.

I didn‚Äôt want to talk in small groups but it didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt want to be there. I just am shy. I had to force myself to talk towards the end so L didn‚Äôt question me.

I feel so loved today. People keep telling me how much they‚Äôre going to miss me while I‚Äôm gone. It‚Äôs only three weeks, but that‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve been away from home ever.

My stepmom told me that my dad cried because he missed my sister and I so much while we were at camp. He just acts like he doesn‚Äôt care all the time but I guess he really does love us.

My grandma said she‚Äôll miss me too.

My whole small group, and even my older friends as well.

Even M and L said they‚Äôd kind of miss me.

I‚Äôll have my phone so I‚Äôll be able to contact anyone but still.

I promised SO many people I‚Äôd face time or call them or text them while I was gone. I really don‚Äôt know if I can keep up with it all.

Ughhh but I finished packing. I‚Äôll have to do some last minute packing Sunday morning/Saturday night but it‚Äôll be fine!

These family reunions are so BORING. I really struggle with liking my grandparents and I hope they aren‚Äôt too critical of my art/ ME.

I just plan on chilling out in our lawn chairs the whole time. I‚Äôll bring my sketchbook. I‚Äôll hopefully get some time to hang out with my ‚Äúcousins.‚Äù

They‚Äôre so different. The older one is this little know-it-all who thinks he‚Äôs the smartest kid ever, and while he IS super smart, he lacks in maturity and wisdom.

The younger one is a lot of fun and tries to live up to his brother but doesn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs still pretty young. I remember when he was just a tiny baby. I remember before he was even born‚Äî dang.

I‚Äôm going to listen to podcasts all 5 hours there and 5 back. That reminds me, I need to download them tonight! I‚Äôll bring a book just in case if I remember.

Stranger things comes out tomorrow and I‚Äôm sad I won‚Äôt be able to see if for four more weeks. Ughhh.

Also this may be the last time I see my great grandma. I feel so much guilt for not knowing her more. I know I‚Äôll feel guilty when she dies, but if I‚Äôm honest with myself, I don‚Äôt feel like taking on the task to know her more.

Maybe that‚Äôs a horrible thing to say but whatever.

Maybe I‚Äôll have a couple more times to go out to see her. She‚Äôs pretty resilient.

I should go download those podcasts now and go to bed."
0,"I don‚Äôt want help
I don‚Äôt ask for help or advice when it comes to being happy. It‚Äôs like I know what advice I‚Äôm gonna get. It‚Äôs just the fact that I don‚Äôt want to get better. So I could know everything and still not feel any different because I‚Äôd rather sleep for 24 of the day than actually improve. Kind of sucks that it feels like my human drive to thrive has been destroyed."

Im pretty sure I forgot to post yesterday but meh. These last few days have been amazing. I‚Äôve been putting myself out there. I didn‚Äôt realize that men actually want to date me.

She thinks it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm out having casual sex since I‚Äôm not the type to do so. She said I continue to keep my walls up and I‚Äôm going to end up where I was when Josh left. To be honest I haven‚Äôt really thought of falling in love. My ex husband was in town and it was a shit show. He told me that I should stop trying to fill the hole in my heart. He is kind of right. I don‚Äôt like the guy but he knows me better than most people do. I don‚Äôt ever want to feel that emptiness when you fall in love. When Josh left it was a very hard lesson. I was so broken and toxic. Ugh, I don‚Äôt want to go down the rabbit hole. I‚Äôm going to continue to put myself out there."

Yesterday

I moped around and did nothing

Went with my sister to the Apple store to get her phone fixed at 4

Ate dinner at schlotzskys. Split a pizza with my sister and bought a Cinnabon for desert.

After that my dad and sister dropped me off at the movie theater. I sat around waiting inside for someone else to show up that I knew.

I saw K walk in. He stood on the other side of the lobby area looking at his phone. I stood up and called to him. He didn‚Äôt hear. Then I awkwardly stood in front of him until he looked up and was like oh hi.

We talked together for a little bit. Then finally B&B showed up so we went outside to wait for the others. We divided the tickets and went inside and found seats.

I sat on the isle next to B & E.

We saw Spider-Man: Far From Home.

It was AWESOME and hilarious.

The end scene was CRAZY. It‚Äôs too bad J had to leave just before it. The end scene changes everything for spider man.

Anyways I won‚Äôt spoil because it only came out yesterday.

But today is gonna be a crazy nightmare.

I need to shower, do my laundry, go out to lunch with my grandma and get something from target, stop by the bank, pack for family reunion, also pack for art camp, do that stupid ass drawing for the family reunion, have dinner sometime, go to youth group.

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I wish I had one more day. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to go to this stupid reunion. It‚Äôs not the reunion I hate, it‚Äôs my grandparents.

At least I get to see my chill grandma today."
0,"02.07.19. Life insurance
The life insurance lady came today.

It went better than I thought it would.

I lied, obviously, which is *technically* insurance fraud. So... we‚Äôll see how that goes, I guess.

But I told more of the truth than I planned to!

I think it helped that the nurse liked me- she went a lot easier on me than she could have.

...And that she came an hour early, so I didn‚Äôt have time to clean. She sat at my desk and put her forms right next to the used pipe sitting there.

So it wasn‚Äôt exactly like I could say I‚Äôve never smoked.

Plus, she took my blood and urine. So I guess it‚Äôs better I told her up front rather than getting caught.

But I lied when she asked me if I have any suicide attempts.

And when she ran through a checklist of mental health diagnoses, she didn‚Äôt ask if I have PTSD.

After all, why would she?

I‚Äôm just a regular college kid.

So I didn‚Äôt tell her.

And I told her I only smoke ‚Äúsocially; a couple times a month,‚Äù and that I rarely drink, and that I‚Äôve never done any other substances.

Of course she believed me.

She asked when I last smoked and I said Sunday.

That was the truth.

(Because I was too depressed yesterday to get out of bed at all, even to smoke. But I didn‚Äôt tell her that.)

So hopefully my medical records really are private, and my parents can‚Äôt see the results of my tests.

Because weed is definitely going to show up.

And so is depression.

(That one was on the checklist, unfortunately.)

When she was finished asking questions, she pulled out a scale and told me to get on it.

The number was lower than I thought.

Like, a *lot* lower.

I made her double-check it.

But that was really the number.

I calculated my BMI after she left.

It was... normal.

Really scraping the upper limit of normal, obviously. I‚Äôm like 0.4 points away from being overweight.

But I thought I already *was* overweight.

I feel like a fat, disgusting blob.

But apparently, I‚Äôm... not?

I‚Äôm just a regular, disgusting blob.

Weird.

I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you starve yourself. I only started eating again a few months ago.

So even though I‚Äôve gained a *lot* of weight, I guess I was just catching up.

It‚Äôs definitely time to stop now, though.

I hope I can.

I‚Äôve been binging a lot lately.

This is like when I got my assessment results back and they said my scores were too high to be learning disabled.

I was *shocked*.

I truly thought I was stupid.

I remember walking out of one of the appointments and thinking: *Well, at least they‚Äôll definitely give me accommodations now. I really fucked that one up.*

I even apologized to the testers during the assessment for being so bad at it!

...They wrote that in the report.

Said I have ‚Äúpoor self-concept.‚Äù

Whatever *that* means.

But numbers don‚Äôt lie.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always liked about them.

I‚Äôm not learning disabled, and I‚Äôm not fat, either.

I still *feel* stupid.

...But I also still feel fat.

(I mean, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm skinny. I could stand to lose 15lbs or so. But I felt like a balloon before.)

God, what else don‚Äôt I know about myself?

I almost had a panic attack when it was time to take my blood and the nurse pulled out this giant needle.

I had to run and get my housemate, who‚Äôs a nurse too, because I‚Äôm a pathetic little bitch who‚Äôs afraid of the doctor. Well, the nurse. Anyone with big needles, really.

At least she wasn‚Äôt a doctor!

That made it a lot less scary.

I *hate* doctors.

But they were both really nice to me- my housemate and the nurse.

(And they‚Äôre both nurses! Yay nurses!)

My housemate asked, ‚ÄúCan I hug you?‚Äù

And I nodded, so she held me while the lady put the needle in. I really appreciated that she asked first.

That helped so much!

And she had me look right at her and talked about funny, distracting things so I wouldn‚Äôt be as scared.

And I squeezed my unicorn pillow really tight.

When it was over, the nurse even gave me a compliment for holding my arm so still!

So that was nice.

I did a good job! :)

I‚Äôm still not looking forward to doing this again on Friday for the autoimmune tests.

But my housemate said she would come with me.
And she really helped today.

I don‚Äôt think I could have done it without her.

And after, she even got me a glass of water and went upstairs to get my unicorn pillow for me when I was too woozy to get it myself.

She‚Äôs so, so good to me.

I don‚Äôt deserve her.

(But I‚Äôm really grateful that she thinks I do. Lol!)

When the nurse was packing up, we made idle small chat while I tried to calm down.

She commented on how anxious I was.

So I told her: ‚ÄúI think that was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever been through!‚Äù

The nurse laughed and said: ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

She took one look at me.

Me, with all my privilege.

Me, with my cheerful demeanour.

Me, with my big, pink unicorn pillow that I needed to because I was so afraid of a stupid blood test.

People like me don‚Äôt have real problems.

So I shrugged and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a very easy life.‚Äù

And the nurse said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù"

0,"02.07.19. My mom is worried about me
Yesterday, my mom asked me how my course is going and I said I‚Äôm tired of it.

So she thought that meant I needed to find a new career, one I would be less tired of.

She said: ‚ÄúIf you can picture yourself doing anything, what would excite you?‚Äù

I thought about it for a second.

Then I said: ‚ÄúHonestly, I can‚Äôt picture anything exciting me.‚Äù

Later, my mom referenced back to that.

And she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about you.‚Äù

What the fuck?

Why did she say that?

It‚Äôs confusing, because I thought that was what I always wanted.

But now it‚Äôs happened, and it doesn‚Äôt feel the way I thought it would.

All I could think was: *Oh, **now** you‚Äôre worried?*

Where was she last summer, when I needed her?

She was there.

She just wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

She once came into my room and the whole place stunk of weed, because my friend and I were smoking in there.

My mom said: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù

We said nothing.

Then my mom noticed a bowl of food I‚Äôd left on my desk from dinner. It had been sitting there for two hours or so.

She wrinkled her nose and started screaming at me.

‚ÄúYou disgusting pig, what the fuck is wrong with you? You‚Äôre stinking up the entire house with your filth! Why do you do this? Honestly, you even have a guest over! God, you‚Äôre so disgusting. How can you treat her like this? Take that downstairs and wash it right now! God, you disgust me. Did I really raise you like this?‚Äù

So I took it downstairs and washed it.

And that was the end of that.

When I went back to my room, my friend said: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck just happened?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

My mom wasn‚Äôt worried about me then.

I was doing drugs in my bedroom to cope, and she was only worried about what my friend might think of a dirty bowl on my desk.

Or when I was staying out of the house all night, sometimes for days on end. Bouncing around from couch to work to a different couch back to work.

On Friday afternoons, I would disappear for the whole weekend. I‚Äôd stay wherever I could, as long as I was out of the house and able to get high.

One time I stayed at a McDonald‚Äôs tripping my balls off until 4am. I don‚Äôt even remember what I took.

I stumbled home around 7:30am.

My hair was a mess, my eyes were glazed over, and yesterday‚Äôs rumpled work clothes reeked of booze.

My mom asked: ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúOut.‚Äù

And I went upstairs to change.

My mom wasn‚Äôt worried then, either.

Or what about during winter break, when my dad trapped me in an elevator and touched my back after I told him not to?

He set off my flashbacks and made me cry.

Trapped, in that stupid fucking elevator.

Where was my mom then?

Oh right- she was in the elevator, too.

Laughing right alongside my dad.

She told me to stop being so dramatic.

That I‚Äôd never had a problem with anyone touching my back before, so stop making up problems.

I tried to kill myself a month later.

She never once worried.

Or what about when I was 12 years old, and decided to stop going to school?

I would sleep for 3 days in a row - just like I did this weekend - and my mom wouldn‚Äôt even notice.

She wouldn‚Äôt make me go to school.

She never even tried to get me out of bed.

On the second day, sometimes she would come check to make sure I was still alive, and she‚Äôd bring me a glass of water or slice of toast or something.

She would say: ‚ÄúDo you feel like going to school today?‚Äù

From under the covers, without moving a muscle or even opening my eyes, I would mutter: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

And she would leave again.

She wasn‚Äôt worried then, either.

Not until I tried to kill myself a year later.

And even then, she wasn‚Äôt worried until the doctor told her she‚Äôd better be.

Where was she when I needed her?

Why wasn‚Äôt she worried?

I needed her then.

I don‚Äôt anymore.

I went through two suicide attempts, countless drugs, self-harm, depressive spirals, reckless behaviour, and even went on medical leave after failing out of school.

She never even noticed.

Occasionally, she would get mad at me for being moody or misbehaving.

But she *never* worried.

And now, I‚Äôm just a little tired.

*Now* she chooses to care?

*This* is when she decides to show up?

My mom doesn‚Äôt *get* to worry about me now.

Now that I‚Äôm easier, now that my problems don‚Äôt scare her or make her feel like a bad parent.

Now, all of a sudden, she wants to step up?

*Now* she wants to be there for me?

It‚Äôs too late.

I don‚Äôt want her anymore.

And I fucking *hate* that she thinks she has the right to insert herself where she doesn‚Äôt belong in my life.

When we got off the phone, my mom sent me a text:

*Love you*

I didn‚Äôt even notice it for 20 minutes. When I did, I wrote back:

*Don‚Äôt be clingy*

She sent me a laughing emoji.

I never responded."

I kind of went overboard yesterday.

But I don‚Äôt take any of it back.

I went to the doctor for the first time in like 4-5 years.

It was strange.

The office hadn‚Äôt changed much in all the years I‚Äôd been going.

I sat next to my dad in the waiting room.

I heard a nurse call my name and I followed her into the back where we stopped at a scale.

Not the scale. Anything but the scale.

It said I weighed 10 pounds more than what my scale at home says.

And I was one inch shorter than I had thought.

Then she led my dad and I into a small room with a table I had to sit on and a chair for my dad.

The nurse was going over my dad/I's info. We had to update our address. She asked if Melinda was still my mother and my dad paused and says no, she is deceased.

The lady went ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I almost teared up but I didn‚Äôt.

She left and the doctor came in.

The doctor asked me questions about any medications I was taking, how my period was going, if I was exercising, eating healthy, etc. and then she was asking my dad about family medical history.

She asked my dad if the info they had on my mom was correct. The woman said she had a history of alcoholism, anxiety and depression, bipolar, etc.

I didn‚Äôt know about the alcoholism. This was news to me. My mom had never told me she‚Äôs had a drink in her life, but I didn‚Äôt ask.

My mom was a wreck. My mom was just like me.

I miss her.

Now that we were on the subject of my dead mom the doctor asked me how I was doing. She asked if I‚Äôd been experiencing anxiety or depression. I said no. What was I supposed to say? My dad was right there.

She asked if I‚Äôd ever talked to a counselor and I said no. She asked if I wanted to. I said not really.

My dad was there. Watching me.

Then she started talking about the HPV vaccine and how it can prevent sexually transmitted diseases etc.

My dad said he was going to hold off on it. Apparently my mom once told him that she never wanted the girls to get it.

Eventually she left and another woman came in to give me my meningitis shot. It was quick and didn‚Äôt hurt. I got a bandaid with roller skating dinosaurs.

We left and got in the car and never said a peep.

I emailed the lady from the college and told her I got my vaccine.

Now I can go.

I‚Äôm excited and nervous.

I‚Äôm so excited about the possibility to see F again.

I really am starting to miss him. Although I feel extremely guilty for not having made much, but I still miss him.

I sat on the toilet looking at my thighs.

I ran my fingers over the scars.

I hate my body. I hate what I‚Äôve done to myself.

I want to make art.

I want to be free,

I need a break.

My sister is progressively getting more cruel with each passing day.

I should pray for her."
0,"01.07.19. The Giving Tree
Once there was a tree...
and she loved a little girl.
And everyday the girl would come
and think of all the things she would like to do:
she would gather the tree‚Äôs leaves
and make them into crowns
and play queen of the forest.
She would climb up her trunk
and swing from her branches
and eat apples
and they would play hide-and-go-seek.
And when she was tired,
she would sleep in the tree‚Äôs shade.
And the girl was so excited to do it all.
And the girl loved the tree...
very much.
And the tree was happy.

But when the girl tried to gather leaves
and make them into crowns
The tree said: ‚ÄúYou look stupid.‚Äù
And when the girl
went to climb up the tree‚Äôs trunk
and play in her branches
the tree said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too heavy.‚Äù
And when they would play
hide-and-go-seek,
the tree would get distracted
by a phone call
and stop looking for the girl.
So the girl ate apples by herself
while the tree was
busy with
more important things.
And when the girl was tired
she would curl up to sleep in the shade
but the tree was tired too
and had worked very hard
much harder than the girl, who was lazy
and the tree
was just under a lot of stress right now.
So instead of sleeping
the girl would use all her might
to hold up the tree, so the tree could rest.
Because the girl loved the tree...
very much.
And the tree was happy.

But time went by.
And the girl grew older.
And the tree was often alone.
Then one day the girl came to the tree
and the tree said, ""Come, Girl, come and
climb up my trunk and swing from my
branches and eat apples and play in my
shade and be happy.""
""I am too big to climb and play"" said
the girl.
‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre a selfish, spoiled bitch,‚Äù said the tree,  ‚ÄúStop acting like a brat and be grateful.‚Äù
And the girl did nothing.
And the tree said,
‚ÄúI gave you everything
and this is the thanks I get?
I let you gather my leaves
and climb on my trunk
and play in my branches
and eat all my apples
and sleep in my shade.
I love you more than anyone.
Why do you treat me this way?‚Äù
Then the tree said nothing else,
and neither did the girl.
Until the girl left
and the tree was alone.

But then one day the girl came back
And the tree shook with joy.
And the girl said,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, tree,
I‚Äôm sorry.
I should have climbed
on your trunk and swung from your
branches.
Not everyone has a tree,
and I‚Äôm very lucky to have such a good one.
You always give me apples
when I‚Äôm hungry and
shade over my head when
I need somewhere to sleep.‚Äù
And the tree was happy.

‚ÄúI want you to buy things
and have fun,‚Äù said the tree,
‚ÄúBecause I am such a good tree.
Take my apples, Girl, and sell them in
the city. Then you will have money and
you will be happy.""
The girl said, ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want money.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave I spoiled you that much?‚Äù said the tree.
‚ÄúNot everyone has a tree
who gives them money.
Some trees don‚Äôt love
their little girls the way
I love you.
Show some respect and be grateful.‚Äù
And so the girl climbed up the
tree and gathered her apples
and carried them away.
And the tree was happy.

But the girl stayed away for a long time...
and the tree was sad.
And then one day the girl came back
and the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak.
And she said, ""Come, Girl,
climb up my trunk
and swing from my
branches and be happy.""
""I am too busy to climb trees,"" said the girl.
And the tree said
‚ÄúOh, *you‚Äôre* so busy?
And how do you think I got
you all those apples?
By sitting around doing nothing?
I gave you everything
and this is the thanks I get?‚Äù
So the girl promised to call more.
And the tree was happy.

But then the girl stayed away
for a long time again.
And when she came back,
the tree was less happy
and she hardly spoke.
""Ungrateful girl,"" she whispered,
""Why should I love you
when you clearly don‚Äôt love me?
Why don‚Äôt you
play with me anymore?
We always used to play
when you were little
and you loved it so.‚Äù
""I am too old and sad to play,""
said the girl.
‚ÄúYou know nothing
of age or sadness,‚Äù
said the tree. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand
what real pain is
when you have a little girl
of your own someday.
See, this is why
you still need your tree.
You clearly don‚Äôt know
what‚Äôs best for you.
Now be a good girl
and come play in my branches.‚Äù
But the girl did not want to listen
to the tree anymore.
""I want a boat that will
take me far away from here.
Can you give me a boat?""
""Cut down my trunk
and make a boat,"" said the tree.
""Then you can sail away...
and be happy.""
And so the girl cut down the tree‚Äôs trunk
and made a boat and sailed away.
‚ÄúGood riddance,‚Äù said the tree.
And the tree was happy
... but not really.

And after a long time
the girl came back again.
""I am sorry, Girl,""
said the tree,""but I have nothing
left to give you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for anything,‚Äù said the girl.
‚ÄúI am sorry,"" sighed the tree.
""I wish that I could give you something...
but I have nothing left.
I am just an old stump.
I am sorry...""
And the girl knew then
that she had a very special tree.
Hers was a Giving Tree-
one who, for better or for worse,
could only love
by giving her everything.
""I don't need very much now,"" said the girl,
""just a quiet place to sit and rest.
I am very tired.""
""Well,"" said the tree, straightening
herself up as much as she could,
""well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting.
Come, Girl, sit down. Sit down and rest.""
And the girl did.
And the tree was happy."

Happy [Canada Day](https://imgur.com/gallery/QKNMeBo)!

My housemates burst into my room and DEMANDED that we go outside and take group photos RIGHT NOW.

I was still in bed.

I told them to go without me.

But they, dressed in bright reds and summer clothes, dragged me out to the backyard, with my grey sweats and black t-shirt and unwashed hair.

They said, if I didn‚Äôt want to be in any pictures, I should at least be the photographer.

(Also, one of my housemates was in a hurry and they didn‚Äôt have time to set up the tripod.)

So I did a photo shoot with them, under the bright sunshine, while they ran around laughing and posing.

It was fun to watch them enjoy themselves.

And we got some good pictures.

I‚Äôll enjoy editing them later, now that I‚Äôm back in bed.

I‚Äôm grateful that my friends still want me there, even though I‚Äôm just a dark cloud hanging over them.

But I wish I wasn‚Äôt so tired.

I wish I was that carefree.

They *wanted* to celebrate.

I wish I wanted to do anything.

But I don‚Äôt.

I just wanted to go back to bed.

...

Update:

My housemates are downstairs playing ‚ÄúSweet Caroline‚Äù on the piano and singing along.

I‚Äôm *still* just in bed.

And honestly, even though I can hear how much fun they‚Äôre having, I just wish they would stop.

I find all the sunshine and happy music and celebrating annoying. I want it to stop so I can sleep in peace.

...What the *fuck* is wrong with me?

A few years ago, on Canada Day, I painted my entire face to look like the flag, and ran around covered head to toe in a red jumpsuit with a flag draped around me like a cape.

I‚Äôve always *loved* celebrating.

I once put together a calendar that had a national holiday for every day, so I‚Äôd always have something to celebrate.

I‚Äôve always been the one running around screaming and laughing and dancing without a care in the world.

I was always the person who wanted to get in the spirit.

And I hated people who brought down the mood.

After all, why couldn‚Äôt they just be happy?

Now, I feel like the Grinch.

This isn‚Äôt me.

Something is wrong.

The mental illness is winning.

And I don‚Äôt know how to stop it.

...God, that music is so fucking irritating.

Why can‚Äôt they all just shut the fuck up?

0,"01.07.19. The giant cat wheel
My mom once bought a five-foot-tall wheel for the cat to run on because she felt like he was getting too fat.

So we lured my cat into the basement, dangled a toy in there, and held it over his head while he jumped on and started jogging in a fruitless attempt to reach it.

He lost interest pretty quickly.

So now we just have a massive, useless hamster wheel in our basement.

People always find it funny when they come over and ask what it is and I explain to them that it was for our cat‚Äôs exercise regimen.

One time I even tried to crawl in there and run in it, too-  the cat‚Äôs not the only one who needs more exercise!

(I almost broke it, and myself. Guess I should have paid more attention to the 30-pound weight limit.)

But even though I didn‚Äôt fit, sometimes I still feel like the cat running in that ridiculous wheel.

All the effort I put into changing - everything I did to pull myself out of the hole I dug myself into - it was all so exhausting.

I kept telling myself it would be worth it in the end, because I would be better. Everything would be.

Was I just wearing myself out with all that work?

I tried as hard as I know how and I‚Äôm still failing.

Still skipping school.

Still can‚Äôt get out of bed.

Still miserable and stressed and sad.

I gave it my all and it didn‚Äôt make a difference.

Now I‚Äôm too tired to keep going, and I‚Äôm still right where I started.

I wonder, was I ever going anywhere at all?

What was the point of trying?

I‚Äôm gonna be stuck in that same spot on the wheel no matter what. I could sprint, jog, walk, cartwheel; nothing would change.

The wheel just keeps spinning, with me at the bottom.

It doesn‚Äôt go anywhere or do anything.

It just wastes time and energy.

So why bother getting up at all?

I‚Äôm going nowhere.

And I‚Äôm so tired of running."

I don‚Äôt want to be the same anymore.

And get ready for a cheesy, girl just got back from summer camp and is going to change her life.

But I think I mean it this time.

I had a long talk/walk with L the third night at camp.

I‚Äôd been really depressed and just couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone until she asked me what was wrong.

I opened up to her about how I felt about my mom dying. How angry I am and was towards God. How totally distant I‚Äôve been.

And I‚Äôve never talked to anyone face to face about that.

But I‚Äôm really glad I did. Because at the end of the day, I need Jesus.

I‚Äôve struggled to hard trying to do it on my own the last few years, and I just forgot how good it was to trust Him.

And being with my church all week and hearing truth, I just felt such peace knowing that this world is not my home. That God has a plan.

And a week ago I was so far removed from God I would have laughed at myself.

But I know in my heart of hearts and even from experience that following my heart leads me no were good and I can‚Äôt rely on myself.

The only time in my life I‚Äôve felt at peace is trusting God.

And something happened today I didn‚Äôt expect in the least.

Alex shared her testimony of how the Lord had worked through her at camp this week. And she‚Äôs decided to place her trust in Him.

And she wrote this beautiful speech she said to our small group. And after it was done, I have never felt such joy.

I know her so well. I got her a job where I work. I keep up on all her drama with boys and everything. But a week ago she didn‚Äôt claim to be a Christian.

I related to so much of what she said I started bawling, and so did a half dozen other girls. I was so 100% not expecting it.

And I just thought. If God can change her heart, He can change mine.

And it‚Äôs true. I know he can. I have a hard time trusting though. I‚Äôm just so used to relying on myself.

I finally feel like my life isn‚Äôt heading downhill and praise God for that.

It‚Äôs going to be hard. I really struggle with what people will think of me.

Even writing this is hard. I‚Äôm terrified of losing the respect of the people in my life.

But like Philippians 3:8 says;

‚ÄúMore than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,‚Äù

And I wish my heart desired it to be true. I pray that God would change me.

I‚Äôm sick of wallowing in my unworthiness and helplessness.

I need Christ."

I got attacked by a cat today during my volunteer shift, then missed my bus and had to walk through a really sketchy, isolated area.

...Plus, I missed my housemate‚Äôs birthday.

So by the time I got home, I was pretty stressed out.

All I wanted to do was curl up in a ball in bed and pity myself until it was late enough for me to get high.

But the second I stepped through the door, my housemate said: ‚ÄúOh good, you‚Äôre home!‚Äù

She had 300 water balloons, a wiffle ball, baseball bat, and apparently, a boring day.

She wanted to do something fun, with all four of us.

First, we tried playing baseball outside.

...We hit a car.

Luckily the owner was super nice about it, and wasn‚Äôt mad at all.

Just kidding!

We ran.

(The car was fine; I checked when I grabbed the ball.)

Then, once we were safely back inside, my housemate thought it would be funny to throw a water balloon at me. It splattered all over the kitchen.

So I did the mature thing, and dumped a glass of water over her head.

...And all over our wooden floor.

We ended up having a water fight in the kitchen.

Our only responsible housemate was not impressed.

(Worth it.)

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt just get high and go to bed.

It‚Äôs been harder lately, because my depression has really kicked in. I‚Äôm sort of just drifting through life.

I don‚Äôt really feel anything except anxious and empty and irritated.

I‚Äôve mostly just been passing time, waiting for all this to be over one way or another.

But I‚Äôm grateful to have housemates who drag me out when I want to stay in.

They give me a break from all the shit in my head.

I don‚Äôt deserve it, but I‚Äôm too selfish to let them go.

They make me happy, even if it doesn‚Äôt last long.

And they remind me that in the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm really lucky.

I have friends who support me emotionally, and parents who support me financially.

I have a second chance at school and a really fun volunteer job and a nice house and enough money to buy takeout when I‚Äôm too depressed to cook (which is often) and as much weed as I want.

I have a family that loves me, even if sometimes they have funny ways of showing it. Not everyone has that.

(My family‚Äôs not malicious. They‚Äôre just idiots. But they don‚Äôt hurt me on purpose- I got really lucky there.)

And I have other people that I genuinely care about, who care about me, too. Not everyone has that, either.

I don‚Äôt want to take any of this for granted.

Things could be a whole lot worse.

I‚Äôve always wished that I could turn off my heart and just navigate life.

I am in a constant state of feeing not good enough for anyone.

Pep talk- remember to smile and text the ones I care about today. Let them know how important they are and that I appreciate them. Remember to look down at the flowers and up at the sky to remember how incredibly lucky I am to be alive regardless of how much my heart tells me I don‚Äôt want to live. Remember to have an open heart and an open mind. Healing takes time. It‚Äôs ok to be sad.

Then I just closed my eyes and listened to her play.

She couldn‚Äôt believe I actually wanted her to continue.

I couldn‚Äôt believe she thought I wanted her to stop.

Maybe it was the drugs, but I thought it sounded nice.

Eventually, the food arrived, and we moved to the kitchen table to eat.

I thought about other topics of conversation, when I realized we had nothing left to talk about for the day.

I thought about how awkward it was to eat in silence with someone, until I realized she was doing it too.

And I thought about how neither of us really felt the need to talk at all.

It was just nice to have each other‚Äôs company.

Then our other housemate got home.

My housemates hung out in my room last night.

...Which is *insane*.

No one ever hangs out in my room.

People barely even come into my room at all.

Some people like having friends in their room. One of my housemates even sometimes asks me to come into hers, because she enjoys hosting!

Not me.

If my housemates need to ask me something, they‚Äôll come in for as long as it takes to get the answer, and then leave.

Everyone knows it‚Äôs not personal, I just hate having people in my room.

It‚Äôs *my* room.

If I want to hang out, I‚Äôll go downstairs.

Or go into one of their rooms, if they say it‚Äôs ok.

(They‚Äôve told me to stop asking, but I still do.)

I already thought it was pretty crazy of me that I left the door open the other day.

In my family‚Äôs house, doors are always closed - all of them, all the time.

And I‚Äôve always liked it that way.

It feels safe.

Like a fortress.

When I‚Äôm in my room, with the door closed (and usually also locked), I can let my guard down.

Because everything in my room is exactly the way it always is, and it‚Äôs all how I want it, too.

Plus, it‚Äôs totally safe from other people, who can change things and do whatever they want to my stuff.

Until yesterday.

I was high, eating pizza and hanging out as usual when two of my housemates barged in with a ridiculous idea they wanted to tell me about.

Next thing I knew, one of them was curled up in my comfy chair, arms wrapped around the stuffed unicorn pillow I keep there.

The other was flopped across my bed, moaning in comfort and asking where I got my mattress topper.

The weirdest part was, I was fine.

I didn‚Äôt mind them being there.

I was a little worried it would smell weird or they would notice a stain or something else that would give away how disgusting I truly am.

But if they thought it was gross, they did a good job hiding it. Not that I think there actually was anything.

I just get anxious.

But they weren‚Äôt.

They were just having a good time.

...In my room.

With me.

And all my personal stuff.

And they liked it!

They were relaxed.

And once I got used to it, so was I.

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would touch or break my stuff.

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would see how disgusting I am and not want to be my friend anymore.

...One of them even commented on how clean it is.

(Probably because she saw my bedroom in the last house, when I was too depressed to even clean broken glass off the floor. That room *was* gross.)

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would stay too long, or refuse to leave if I got tired and wanted to be alone.

...Probably because my housemates were as confused that this was happening as I was.

(They‚Äôve never not been allowed in my room. It‚Äôs just sort of an unspoken rule.)

But I trusted them to respect my space.

I trusted them to come into my space.

I trusted them enough to want them there.

...Then one of my housemates wondered if we should switch rooms and I was at the door in a second.

So I definitely still like having my own private space.

But... they were in my room."
0,"Rebound or eye opener?
Recently met a new guy through my best friends boyfriend. I don't know if I'm excited to meet someone new or if I'm excited to get out of this.

I do know I do not want any sort of relationship at this point of my life. I don't even want to get married. So there isn't much sense to start to build a relationship with someone just to have it go nowhere.
I'm rambling. I just do not want to make someone a rebound or idk. I just don't know and I think too much and then I get confused.

I don't love him. I don't even feel bad about this new guy.

Should I? Or am I just being a spiteful bitch?"

I think I was staying up late because I was unsatisfied and wanted something more. Like the night wasn't over yet because there was something more I hadn't done yet. A feeling, a *craving* that just hadn't been filled.

I felt good today though hanging with my brother, eating with good company, and feeling sweetness from my coworker. I think I'll sleep alright."

Didn‚Äôt do much today. Woke up, watched a movie, ate lunch, got my braces taken off.

That was painful and required a whole lot more drilling than I thought. I can still hear the drills ringing in my ear. It won‚Äôt stop and it‚Äôs kind of scaring me.

May have to put on some music to sleep.

I face timed A for a while and I packed all of my clothes for camp. I‚Äôm all packed except for some stuff I need to throw in the bag in the morning.

I‚Äôm taking a video camera. It‚Äôs not mine, I just forgot to return it to F before the school year ended. It‚Äôll be fine, I know he probably doesn‚Äôt mind.

I don‚Äôt want to look like one of those vloggers though. That‚Äôs the last thing I want to be seen as.

After dinner I FaceTimed P. We talked for a while. I can tell she‚Äôs really excited. I‚Äôm really excited. I hope she can sleep tonight. She‚Äôs been suffering from insomnia lately.

I got a call from the lady in charge of organizing things for the art camp I‚Äôm attending. Or ‚Äúresidency‚Äù as she calls it. Bullshit. It‚Äôs kind of a residency I guess but don‚Äôt make it fancier than it is.

Apparently I hadn‚Äôt turned in some immunization paperwork and I found out I was missing a vaccine.

My dad was just like, I‚Äôll schedule an appointment for next week. And just like that.

I hate getting shots. Oh god I hope they don‚Äôt look at my arm too much. My dad will be there. He‚Äôs never really stared at my arm. Maybe they‚Äôll do it in my right I hope. The scars have faded but sometimes when the light is right they are noticeable if you‚Äôre looking at them.

I‚Äôm okay with opening up to my dad about me cutting my arm. I‚Äôll just tell him it was a thing I went through. Just a phase. The scars on my arm aren‚Äôt bad and they look really old.

They‚Äôre all on my outer arm though. Except for the pale symbol I made on my forearm.

Anyways. I don‚Äôt need to be worried. I‚Äôm just making up problems that aren‚Äôt even there really.

I tried to watch another movie to kill time but it didn‚Äôt work. I can‚Äôt believe how fast today went by.

Well,

I leave for church camp tomorrow.

6 hours on a charter bus with 50 odd students.

Going to learn about God and literally break each other in extreme games.

Ironic maybe?

But we can‚Äôt bring phones.

Which makes me really paranoid. I know I‚Äôll have friends close.

But what IF. What if I have some sort of emotional crisis. Having internet access is one of the only things that have helped me with my anxiety the last few months.

Just knowing that help is out there. Anonymous help.

I‚Äôll probably be okay.

I hope Alyssa isn‚Äôt on my case too much.

At least she won‚Äôt be on the bus. She‚Äôs already there.

I‚Äôm really tired.

I hope I can sleep though. I had a hard time last night.

So goodbye dumb diary for 5 days.

I‚Äôll be sure to write all about it either Sunday or Monday.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll lose my streak but I haven‚Äôt been keeping track.

Bye for now."

My mom makes me so mad sometimes.

She called me today out of nowhere, just to talk.

Which was fine.

Until she asked if I was coming home this weekend.

I said probably not, since my housemate got reconcussed and it‚Äôs probably best I stay nearby.

Then my mom started asking me 10 million useless questions about that.

She told me I should take her to the hospital.

I said I already did.

She told me we should hire someone to get all the puke out of the carpet.

I told her I already cleaned the carpet.

She said: ‚ÄúI really think you should hire someone. You can‚Äôt just walk around with puke-y carpets.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt fucking ask you!

We don‚Äôt *have* puke-y carpets.

I cleaned them *twice*.

With carpet cleaner!

I took my housemate to the hospital, at 3am.

I bought her sunglasses and gave her medicine and watched her symptoms and sat with her while she was in pain and did everything else you‚Äôre supposed to do for someone with a head injury.

I fucking DID all that already!

Why does she always assume I didn‚Äôt?

Everyone else said I did everything right.

But my mom always assumes I did it all wrong, if I even did it at all.

She always thinks I‚Äôm completely fucking useless, no matter what I do.

I ended up telling her my housemate‚Äôs mom cleaned the carpet.

Then she was satisfied.

Other people can do things right.

It‚Äôs just me who‚Äôs a useless failure.

If she thought I had done it alone, she would have hired a carpet cleaner to my house, and I wouldn‚Äôt have even found out until the guy rang the doorbell.

But I *did* do it alone.

And we don‚Äôt *need* a fucking carpet cleaner!"

My Spotify premium ran out today :-(

I can‚Äôt afford to buy premium till tomorrow, but there would be no point because I won‚Äôt have my phone for 5 days starting Wednesday.

I JUST REMEMBERED 4 DAYS TILL THE BLACK KEYS RELEASE THE NEW ALBUM AND IM FUCKING STOKED!

I‚Äôm pissed as hell I‚Äôll be singing about Jesus 288 miles away from home without a phone.

At least I still have podcasts. Until they find a way to integrate ads into podcasts, on top of the ones already in the podcasts.

I cleaned my room and finally washed my sheets for once. They were gross as any unkept teenagers bed is.

When I took off the sheet there was this other fitted sheet underneath I‚Äôve had to protect my mattress. All over it were like these lines of dried blood.

Probably from when I passed out after being satisfied with my cuts and just bled into my sheets. I don‚Äôt know HOW my step mom has not questioned me.

She‚Äôs washed that towel that had the bloody lines all over it. She literally returned pencil sharpener blades that were in my pants pocket when she did laundry. Probably has even seen the bloody tissues in my room.

I‚Äôm more careful now but how can she be so dumb. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm such a convincing actor?

And it‚Äôs not like she has the slightest clue I was sad/ am sad.

Anyways.

I changed my sheets and they‚Äôre all different shades of beige. With a knit throw on top. I‚Äôm testing which blanket to bring to camp since it‚Äôs not wise to bring my entire comforter.

I got my hair dyed. It doesn‚Äôt feel any different really. Just more saturated than it was this morning. Then I got my nails done AND DAMN.

I hadn‚Äôt had my nails done since before I got a job, and I rarely wear nail polish‚Äî in fact, I choose not to wear it because it‚Äôs just extra hassle no one gives a shit about.

But I picked out this deep purple. And they told me to go sit down in this chair, and this cute boy sat down and started prepping his stuff.

I‚Äôve never had my nails done by a guy, but that‚Äôs not saying much because I‚Äôve only had them done twice.

But having a young, attractive guy hold your hand was the most amazing feeling in the world. I was super self conscious about my hands and fingers‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt care. It was just so nice having a cute guy hold my hand I wanted to melt into the chair.

I‚Äôve never held anyone‚Äôs hand for long‚Äî especially not a guy. Maybe in that square dancing unit in 5th grade‚Äî but that‚Äôs been it.

I‚Äôve never even kissed someone. I‚Äôm 17 and haven‚Äôt kissed a boy, meanwhile I overhear conversations of girls my age laugh at someone for not trying anal yet.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want physical affection‚Äî it would just be too stressful. First of all I‚Äôm a fat piece of shit, and even if someone liked me enough not to care, I couldn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm too paranoid of my parents. I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll find out. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I broke up with my fucking online boyfriend. There were more but that was one of them.

My dad has NEVER talked to me about boys. Not even a sex talk. Nothing. Nada. He just assumes I don‚Äôt care. Which is partially true, but I‚Äôm almost mad at him for ASSUMING I don‚Äôt care.

But for now, I‚Äôll settle for the cute guy at the nail salon holding my hand and clipping my dead skin and filing my nails. How romantic.

Ugh and I don‚Äôt know why but I broke my clean streak. I literally had ZERO reason to do so today. I found the pencil sharpener I‚Äôve been looking for while cleaning and it was just right there. Waiting for me.

If I want to be clean I can‚Äôt have blades in my room. Not even in the house‚Äî and if so, an inconvenient location. I want to throw it away but I can‚Äôt. I need the reassurance that it‚Äôs there in case I need it.

Even if it‚Äôs a stupid ass pencil sharpener blade.

But damn. Tomorrow is my last day home for a while. I‚Äôll need to pack for camp.

But I get my braces off.

At least my whole day won‚Äôt be boring."

Also, discovered a game called ""Dead by Daylight"". I fell in love with the game but I'm broke. (=w=)I'm watching some playthroughs and welp, some are disastrous and some aren't.

I (also) went out with a friend today. He needs help in finding a part-time job and so I helped him. Afterward, we went to enjoy ourselves in a mall.

I finally have more than two fucking bras and I am so happy. Maybe that‚Äôs a bit TMI, but I‚Äôve shared worse on this fucking subreddit.

I got to church at like 7:10. No one even came downstairs until 8:15. But I got to lay down on the couch for a while with the lights off so it worked out.

I was my usual old goofy self until Alyssa came in. I felt like she was watching me. I was reminded of Friday and felt nervous.

K bought 90 Capri suns and is gonna carry them around in a backpack at camp. I can‚Äôt believe he actually did it lmao.

Sometimes I look at him and feel like he‚Äôs smiling at me. In this weird way that is only him. I kind of like him. It‚Äôd probably never work, but I really enjoy his company. I wish we were better friends.

And suddenly since Friday, N actually knows I exist! I‚Äôm really proud of that, since we‚Äôve been going to church together since I started going when I was like 6.

Boys aside, rest of the day was smooth. It was long though. After lunch my stepmom took me to return some clothes and we ended up buying some much needed bras and she even bought my a pair of pants.

I really like her, she‚Äôs grown on me a lot in the last year. I feel like she‚Äôs been around forever sometimes.

Damn, I forgot to return my library books.

Also I had this FUCKING WEIRD DREAM LAST NIGHT. I was like roommates with Mr. Beast?? Like we shared a house? And all of a sudden I felt like I had to tell people who would know. And I told PewDiePie????

I don‚Äôt even really watch them. I sound like a 9 year old boy right now but I literally have no idea how that made it into my dreams. I did watch a little bit of his videos the other day but damn.

CG was crazy tonight. It was just my sisters friend and her little sister who came. We messed around, and played geo guesser for a while.

After they left we all sat down as a family at the dinner and had ice cream. It was nice in a weird way. My sister looked emotionally worn out.

But suddenly she became nice?? I went into her room and we started talking about camp and shit. We talked for an hour or two.

I don‚Äôt want to think about school. She got me thinking about school and I‚Äôm so over it. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being a socially anxious cunt. I‚Äôm sick of all my inner drama with F. I‚Äôm tired of school.

Anyways. School isn‚Äôt even on my radar rn.

I‚Äôve got damn church camp Wednesday and I‚Äôm excited as shit. I love my friends so much. Me and God got shit to work out, but in the meantime I‚Äôve got good friends.

I cleaned my face really well and did a face mask with my sister and I feel really clean.

Tomorrow I get my hair dyed and my grandma offered to do a manicure with us afterwards. And then Tuesday I get my braces off!!!

I hope she doesn‚Äôt do it too dark! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine.

I definitely failed my midterm.

What if I failed the whole course?

All I‚Äôve done so far is fail.

I‚Äôm wasting my parents‚Äô money and I‚Äôm not even trying to do better.

I‚Äôm not even in the major they think I am- my grades got too low, and I had to switch.

I‚Äôm lying to them, about a lot of things.

They would be so disappointed in me if they knew who I really was.

I‚Äôm a drain on them.

I‚Äôm a drain on everyone.

I have nothing to offer, and I‚Äôm lazy, and I‚Äôm stupid, and I‚Äôm useless, and fat, and unreliable, and a failure.

My date is gonna see how disgusting and useless and awful I am when he sees me today.

Who would want to be with me?

I‚Äôll never amount to anything.

I can‚Äôt decide what will be worse: if he rapes me, or if he‚Äôs too turned off to even want to.

My housemate‚Äôs parents came up to take care of her.

Are they gonna take her home again?

This head injury is worse than the last one was, plus she still has the last one.

I wonder how long she‚Äôll be gone for this time.

I‚Äôm alone again.

Even my therapist won‚Äôt text me back.

And the new one is going away for two weeks after my first appointment with her.

But that doesn‚Äôt even matter, because I won‚Äôt be able to trust her or know what to talk about. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs gonna be there for me.

No one is.

I have to be able to take care of myself.

work been a living. 2 weeks ago this manager in training humiliated me in front of customers and employees and i spoke to my boss about it.things went ok but my boss spent a whole week giving me the cold shoulder. i noticed she gave me a closing shift with the manager in training this week.

I want to rip my emotions out.

Purge them from my brain and body.

You know, sometimes P makes a lot of suicide jokes and I get worried. I know she would NEVER, but I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs in a dark place right now.

But I know something she doesn‚Äôt. Her asshole manager that‚Äôs been giving her hell is best friends with a girl who hates her.

And the girl who hates her is (kind of) a friend of mine. It‚Äôs complicated but anyways, she quit and I‚Äôm so glad. I knew she would soon. I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt sooner.

But sometimes she kind of looks dead inside, when she‚Äôs not joking around and being herself.

It‚Äôs probably nothing, but maybe she‚Äôll tell me stuff at camp. We are sitting together on the bus for like 6 hours there and 6 back.

But god. I really hate myself. I woke up and there was this thunderstorm. At 7 in the morning! I saw the transformer blow across the street and the power went out.

I lit a candle and laid in my bed for a long time. I was absolutely exhausted. I‚Äôm mentally drained.

Then I remembered I had to have lunch with Alyssa today. I freaked out. She was 100% going to ask me what I‚Äôve been reading in the Bible and I haven‚Äôt read shit. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I just read on my own time.

I freaked out and read through Philippians once and a half. And watched a short summary video.

She picked me up and we went to this new chicken restaurant. Her two kids were in the car with her. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Being a mom is HARD. I kind of miss when she didn‚Äôt have kids. But her little boy is the sweetest kid on the planet.

When we were eating she asked me what I‚Äôd been reading. I told her and I just could NOT come up with the words to talk.

My brain was empty and I really just wanted to go home and cry. I can‚Äôt believe I put myself in this situation.

She talked the whole way home.

At least I didn‚Äôt have to do the talking. I said nothing. I was embarrassed and anxious. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs obvious. That maybe I‚Äôm not saved anymore.

I know I can‚Äôt lose salvation but like, it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve felt close to God.

And being totally honest I‚Äôm mad at him. For fucking up my life and killing my mom.

I got back in the house and just wanted to actually die. I turned off the lights and got into bed and just stared at the ceiling for a while.

I turned on a podcast. I didn‚Äôt want to think. I‚Äôm scared of being totally alone with my brain when I‚Äôm not feeling well. It has a habit of making things worse than they probably are.

I wanted to slice up my legs but I was so tired and useless I didn‚Äôt. At first anyways. Later I found that old exacto knife and drew a little blood but it just isn‚Äôt the same since the sharp edge broke off.

I felt guilty. Especially after last night. I know Milla told me that I could always talk to her when I had urges. But I just couldn‚Äôt.

It wasn‚Äôt something I could talk about to anyone at all.

But I got mad at my dumb knife and just laid there and kind of dozed in and out of consciousness for a couple hours.

Eventually I had to get up and get ready for work. I felt a lot better after having some resting time.

I went to work and found out that my new manager I don‚Äôt really like may have quit/got fired.

I may never work with S again. He‚Äôs probably going to quit in the next few weeks when I‚Äôm gone.

I debated not going to work tomorrow but I really fucking need the money bad.

We‚Äôre probably going to be understaffed too.

But after tomorrow I don‚Äôt work until the end of July. Woo hoo.

After work my sister and I went to a T-shirt decorating party for camp at a family from church‚Äôs house.

P and I made shirts that say, ‚ÄúIf lost return to P‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf lost return to (me.)‚Äù

They‚Äôre cute and I love them.

N commissioned me to draw this funny picture of J on his T-shirt for 5$.

Finally I got to impress everyone with my drawing skills.

We all talked for a while and I never usually talk to the guys. I really love my youth group. They are seriously the best people in the world.

I‚Äôm excited for camp.

I‚Äôm not excited about being confronted by Alyssa.

I just could NOT talk today. And it was obvious I was lying partially. I was exhausted and I told her that. I said I was sorry a bunch.

I think I should pray.

For once in my life.

Because the truth is, I wish I hadn‚Äôt strayed.

But if I hadn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd have built some of the friendships at school I have.

I really want to sleep."
0,"21.06.19. A nice night
I‚Äôm in a good mood.

It‚Äôs 10pm on a Friday night.

I‚Äôm smoking a bowl, nestled into my favourite spot on the steps in the backyard, right up against the railing.

There‚Äôs no one out except me and the stars.

My housemates are inside, waiting for me to come back in. We have plans to watch TV.

But that‚Äôs not for a few minutes.

 For now, I can stay right where I am.

Warm drafts of early-summer air breeze by, chilled just the right amount by the darkness of nighttime.

I can feel it brush past my skin; its coolness perfectly contrasts the heat sitting in the air.

I can smell it wash away the scents of yesterday‚Äôs sunshine as a new night sweeps everything clean.

...Maybe even the insides of my soot-soaked lungs.

Who knows?

They definitely feel clearer.

So does my head.

I feel like smiling, even though I don‚Äôt have anything in particular to smile about.

I just want to smile.

...God, I‚Äôm so extra when I‚Äôm high.

But I like how I feel right now."

Is this what the patriarchy is?

The grey one even has more buttons.

At 9:30 grandma picked up my sister and I, we went to her house, she made us French toast.

At 11 we drove down to this park downtown that has a beautiful view of the skyline and is right on top of the river.

I went to Lilah‚Äôs at noon. He lives in this very normal house for the downtown area. Not the nice ones, but it‚Äôs not shit. It‚Äôs beautiful in its own way.

It‚Äôs the kind of house I‚Äôve always dreamed of having.

I didn‚Äôt say to my dad or grandma or sister that Lilah was a guy. Lilah isn‚Äôt even gay, he‚Äôs just what you‚Äôd call a metrosexual. He‚Äôs straight and cis but gets mistaken for gay because he dresses in a certain fashion.

I‚Äôve never heard Lilah talk about romance or anything, he‚Äôs always thinking about art and design all the time. He‚Äôs the hardest working kid I know.

Milla was there already when I got there. Lilah has the cutest dog. And I‚Äôm not really even into dogs. She was so soft and small.

We stood around awkwardly in the kitchen until his parents left to go do something or another and then Lilah and Milla loosened up a lot.

We talked about art and school and shit like we usually do.

Eventually we went on a tour of the place. It was a crammed three story house. The stairs were super loud and creaky. His bedroom was small and his bed was a pullout couch. It‚Äôs well decorated totally to his style.

The entire attic area was painted white with plenty of natural light from a sliding glass door. The whole place was an art studio. There were paintbrushes on the floor. An empty bottle of vodka. Guitars and charcoal. Paint everywhere. It was a messy dream.

I felt like I had stepped into a real version of all the studios I‚Äôve ever imagined.

The sliding glass door was open and there was a small mat on the roof. Milla had already been there for a while it looked like. She had markers laid out all across the mat.

I stepped out onto it and I was fine until I looked around and realized I was three stories up and there was no railing. I started to feel my heart beat hard and fast so I stepped back inside.

Lilah mentioned possibly going somewhere or doing something, so I suggested we go to the art store. I don‚Äôt know why I did because I really didn‚Äôt have any money to spend.

But we did. We went out and hopped in his car and went to the store.

I bought a mini version of the sketchbook I currently have, and a couple pens and markers. Lilah bought like one pen. I realized I could use a student discount even though I‚Äôm a high schooler and I‚Äôve never been more shook.

I could have saved so much money over the years.

We left and went back to his house. We sat down in the living room and watched a documentary on Meow Wolf. The trippy art exhibition/funhouse in Santa Fe.

THE same Santa Fe that F wants to do a trip to. I mentioned that and Milla and Lilah realized they couldn‚Äôt go because they had to go to some concert.

I was fucking mad but I didn‚Äôt say anything.

F needs 10 people to make the trip work. Right now there‚Äôs like none.

I‚Äôm praying it works and if it doesn‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs going to be okay. I won‚Äôt get too upset.

But we watched the movie for an hour. Lilah sat on the other side of the couch. Milla sat in a chair on the other side of the couch facing the other wall.

After a while she was laying in it sideways and upside down with her head looking directly upside down and at me. I realized my shorts weren‚Äôt sticking to my thighs from that angle and were probably exposing my scars if she was looking.

I really didn‚Äôt think she saw anything though and I didn‚Äôt move. Eventually she got up and sat back normally.

Then grandma picked me back up again because Lilah had to leave to take Milla home. We drove past them on the way back. I took a picture of them and sent it to Milla.

I still cannot believe that happened. Never in a million years would I have expected dad to be okay with it. I didn‚Äôt tell him that Lilah wasn‚Äôt a girl but it doesn‚Äôt matter. He looks and sounds as gay as you‚Äôll get but he‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs closeted or anything.

And his house was totally what my dad would classify as the ‚Äúhood.‚Äù But it‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs just a really old area of downtown.

But he said yes! I feel like a total rebel. I love it.

After that grandma picked me up and we went to eat at the place I work. We went though the drive thru. My manager was the one who brought the food out to the car, but he didn‚Äôt know I was in the car. When he gave us the food I rolled the window down and said hi.

He looked confused like I scared him and he was like damn I was scared haha.

He asked if I was working tonight and I said no, but I was tomorrow.

Then my grandma took us home.

I played Minecraft for a little while and went to my room to just lie down.

I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôve never had this much socializing in one week ever. I actually have friends who want to do things with me and I‚Äôm kind of addicted.

After dinner we went to this new toy store that opened. It sells a lot of different things and we went because they moved locations and my dad was curious.

But when we got home I was absolutely dead. It was only 8:30 but I felt like I was going to die.

And I‚Äôm not done socializing yet! I‚Äôve got lunch with Alyssa tomorrow, work, and a party at these people from churches house at 7-9.

Damn I‚Äôm gonna die.

I have to spend all my spare time Sunday Monday and Tuesday being totally alone.

And I had planned on just listening to this podcast and falling asleep an hour ago but then I got a text from Milla.

She said,

‚Äúcan i talk to you about something serious?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like duh of course I‚Äôm always here for ya in my head. I figured she was going to tell me something about Lilah or the guy she‚Äôs been kind of dating.

Then she said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm kind of nervous about bringing this up, but i was really concerned when i noticed it and wanted to check in with you.‚Äù

And I LOST IT.

My heart froze and I had to put my phone down. I was paralyzed with fear because I knew exactly what she was going to say.

She did see. When we were in the living room at Lilahs house today. She saw my scars up my shorts.

I really regret her seeing. I know she‚Äôs completely trustworthy, but I just didn‚Äôt want her knowing. I don‚Äôt want her thinking worse of me.

But we talked about it very briefly and I said I was doing okay.

Things are fine, but I feel so weird.

Especially after talking to Aug about it last night. Now they both know. F knows. My sister vaguely knows but I threatened her not to talk about it to anyone.

So many people.

I didn‚Äôt tell Milla that F knows. I did tell Aug.

I just said a teacher knows. I kind of wish I would have said who, since we both have his class. But Lilah and Milla were talking about him today and were saying how I‚Äôm HIS student. The go to person for him. And I‚Äôm like yeah you‚Äôre right. But they weren‚Äôt being judgy at all.

They understand I worked to be close in his little world, just like they do with their passions and interests. It was really nice to know they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a total kiss ass.

Ugghhhhhh I just can‚Äôt believe she saw.

It‚Äôs one thing to know. Aug knows. He didn‚Äôt see.

Milla saw, she barely knows.

It was easy to talk to Aug because he understood. He deals with the same shit.

But Milla is so different.

Ugh. I‚Äôm a wreck. I‚Äôm trying to hold it together without crying and I just want to finish this damn diary entry and finish yesterday‚Äôs which I didn‚Äôt do hardly.

...

But the worst thing about this is, I have two friends who know. I told them both I‚Äôm doing a lot better and have stopped.

But I don‚Äôt want to stop. I crave it every day.

DAMN I SHOULDVE BOUGHT A FUCKING BLADE!!!! SHIT.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do, after my hair appointment I‚Äôll be flat broke until the 28th.

I wonder if I‚Äôll actually get my money back if I return those clothes or if they‚Äôll give my like coupons or something.

I really could use like 40$ back."

But now, they‚Äôre just gone.

I‚Äôve been pretty anxious lately.

I‚Äôve been finding it hard to focus.

During my lunch break, I went over to my housemate‚Äôs room to chat and get myself out of my own head.

We ended up talking about panic attacks, and what the right things are that we can do to help each other is when we‚Äôre having one.

It was really nice.

Now I don‚Äôt have to worry if I‚Äôm doing the right thing or not- I know exactly what to do for her.

And she‚Äôll be there to support me, too.

Then she let me bring my school stuff to study with her so I could focus better, since being alone for too long makes my thoughts (and heartbeat) race.

It‚Äôs been interesting for me to realize that I don‚Äôt actually like being alone.

I always thought I preferred to be by myself.

It turns out, I just needed to find the right people to be around.

I didn‚Äôt know you can let your guard down when you‚Äôre not alone. I thought you always have to hide yourself from others, so they don‚Äôt hurt you.

But I can be myself around my housemates.

I can let my guard down, and breathe.

We went down to the kitchen, and my other housemate was there, too.

All of us sat together in the kitchen studying quietly.

They even let me talk out loud while I was thinking. One of them even asked me to talk out loud again when I stopped to think in my head.

She said it was soothing to hear my voice in the background while she did other things.

Which is crazy, because I find it soothing to hear them in the background while I do other things.

With them there, I could relax.

I could focus.

And even though I have a midterm tomorrow (that I am *not* ready for, RIP), I was happy."

Woke up at 7, showered and played Minecraft until 9:00.

I waited upstairs half an hour for L to pick me up. We drove to the museum and talked. We sat in the coffee shop. She bought my hot coca even though I said I‚Äôd pay for it.

We talked about the youth group, upcoming camp, art and stuff.

We could have sat there a lot longer but we got up and decided to actually go look at art.

We moved through the contemporary section making comments and me sharing my very limited knowledge of some of the paintings.

I noticed things I hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

We finally got to the photography section and I wanted to stay forever. The prints were beautiful. Breathtaking. I thought we had another hour or two but she was like,

‚ÄúOh btw we‚Äôve gotta leave in 30 mins because I remembered I‚Äôd have lunch with someone.‚Äù

Go figure. So we zoomed through the rest of the photography, then I showed her some old impressionist artists and we stopped in the works on paper room.

There were the most BEAUTIFUL PRINTS. I‚Äôve never seen such beauty. Looking at those prints reminds me why I love printmaking so damn much.

I wanted to stay but we had to head out.

On the way to the car she asked me this really big question, how do you deal with art and nudity and such a worldly subculture while being a believer.

I told her it was hard. But that was a lie. I don‚Äôt even give two shits about my art and my beliefs. Maybe I should.

But I tried to explain that God made the human figure and our bodies and that being around nudity is highly personal. I said I would obviously never be okay with nudity in a sexual way in art, but things like that are highly personal.

It was a weird subject and I thought I made a good answer, it‚Äôs hard to write it out again.

... I was tired when writing this.

Long story short, went back home, messed around for a couple hours.

Went out to dinner with P and A.

Went to youth group.

Went home and had a mild crisis talking to Aug. It consisted of me crying on the concrete floor of the storage room in the basement and holding my stuffed animals from when I was a kid.

I talked to Aug and he made me feel a lot better. We talked about SH a bit.

And I slept well."

0,"19.06.19. My grandfather
My grandfather was in the holocaust.

My mom used to tell me stories about him.

He refused to ever talk about it.

But they both thought it was important I knew.

He had to sneak out and spend all night scouring the ground for cigarette butts to collect enough nicotine that he could sell it for food because the Nazis wouldn‚Äôt feed them.

I‚Äôve been told by those who knew him that he shared everything with the others in his camp.

He would always eat last, even though they were all starving the same.

He had to hear his friends‚Äô and family members‚Äô numbers called out, and watch them be lined up in front of a big hole in the ground and shot.

He had to watch them fall into a ditch full of dead bodies. Then, he had to watch more nameless corpses fall on top of them.

He had to share a bunk with fifteen men, because that was all the space they were given.

...But it wasn‚Äôt even that bad, because they were stripped naked and shaved bare and given no blankets in the middle of winter.

They needed to sleep in a pile for warmth, to survive.

He had to walk in pitch black darkness through a sewer drain for three days to escape.

When he reached the exit, the first thing he saw was the barrel of a Nazi‚Äôs gun staring him down between the eyes.

But that Nazi had never looked a Jew in the face before. He didn‚Äôt have the heart to kill my grandfather.

I guess he‚Äôd always just been able to look the other way before. He‚Äôd never had to see what he was doing.

It must be harder when you have to watch them die.

So he just sent my grandfather back through the sewer drain instead.

And my grandfather had to walk another three days in the dark, right back into Hell.

Jews don‚Äôt believe in Hell the way Christians do.

Jews know you don‚Äôt have to die to get there.

We know it‚Äôs really called Auschwitz.

My grandfather‚Äôs dead now.

Sometimes, I think of how ashamed he would be if he saw who I‚Äôve become.

If he saw how weak and pathetic I am.

Because he was really strong.

He survived something really, really bad.

And he never complained.

And he never let it stop him from moving on.

He had a good life, after the war ended and he escaped Poland.

I‚Äôve never been through anything that bad.

I‚Äôve never really been through anything at all.

I just made stuff up, because I‚Äôm pathetic.

He would hate me, if he knew me now.

I don‚Äôt know if Jews believe in Heaven.

But if he‚Äôs there, I hope he hasn‚Äôt been watching me too closely. I hope he hasn‚Äôt seen who I am.

I‚Äôve let him down."

**The Memories**


It's been a struggle being on ""summer vacation"" with no job lined up. I can honestly say the past year has been the hardest of my life.


Not only was I a new mom but, my work environment became extremely toxic. Me and one other coworker were badly taken advantage of, increasingly given impossible amounts of work to complete. While the other two team members got more surmountable workloads.


All part of the school district's latest paradigm shift that accompanied our campus becoming a 1:1 technology campus.


The digital materials Crystal and I created will be used by future teachers for generations and no one will ever know how much time and effort it took to create.

I'd been looking forward to summer because I just needed to get out.

But, without a new job lined up, summer brought little relief. Out of the frying pan, into the fryer, as I prepared for interviews at a different district.


I didn't get a summer vacation last year, either. I've had very little time to myself since I had my son last year. I've been constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY on duty. Not a single moment of rest. Always making lessons and online test materials or taking care of the baby.


I just...yearned and longed for a little bit of free time.


Previous summers I would take a ""nostalgia tour"" and spend some time visiting places that had once been significant to me. Visiting my past self, I suppose.


I usually like looking at the past from the vantage point of the future. I normally visit places that were somewhat stressful to me. Maybe I'm trying to give hope and comfort to my past self.


**The Dream**

Maybe five years ago I had a job, a really stressful job, right across from a church. I didn't know how to drive at the time. My husband would drop me off at work (super early) and pick me up from that church (super late) every day.


I'd wait either in that church or in a nearby fast food restaurant.


Both were awkward places for me to wait, because I'm a- not Christian and b- vegetarian, so there weren't many options for me in a fast food place.


I dreamt that I should visit that church. Like a Salmon returning home I kept longing to visit that part of town but I had one job interview after another (not complaining).


**Adam's Academy**


After applying to the other, massive, local school district, I got calls for interviews at several places both near and far. I applied for both science and art positions (both of which I am certified to teach). Mostly I've been trying to break out of English since the whole subject seemed to be going in a really stressful direction.


I interviewed at Adam's Academy and got called back to do an example lesson. They asked me to do a cross curricular Science-Art lesson.


My lesson took a lot of time to prepare and I was very nervous the day of but they absolutely LOVED it! Said I was an amazing teacher.


Adam's Academy was a bit of a commute but, it would be so worth it to finally teach art.


And I loved the principal. Looked her in the eye and told her that her school was my top choice.


**C. Darwin Elementary**


The day after my Adam's Academy lesson demonstration, I went to my interview for a science position at Darwin.


They could not find any record of having called me for an interview. They sort of acted like maybe I'd made up having been called for an interview as some sort of weird Art of the Deal esque strategy. They said they had no science interviews scheduled for that day but awkwardly offered to go ahead and interview me anyway.


I declined. Back in my car, I tracked down the phone number from the day I'd gotten the call.



**E. Darwin Middle**


""Thank you for calling Darwin Middle, if you know your party's extension, you may enter it now.""


Now it all made sense. I hung up my phone and considered just returning home in shame. It was about half an hour into my scheduled interview time. But for some reason, I called back and explained the situation.


""I'm sorry. Apparently I've gone to the wrong Darwin. I understand if you don't want to interview me now, but I can still come in if you'd like.""


""...Please hold. ...Yes, come on in.""


So, I showed up to my interview about 45 minutes after the scheduled time. I was surprised to find that Darwin Middle was extremely close to my home. I must have passed it a million times and it was tucked just out of sight.


Trying to walk in from the parking lot, I realized I couldn't figure out where the front office was. I saw a man with a faculty badge and asked for his help.


He was headed up to the office and invited me to accompany him.


""Are you here for an interview?"" He asked. ""Yes, but it's already off to a bad start.""


""Oh? Are you late?"" he asked


""Not just late, I went to the wrong Darwin. So embarrassing.""


We continued to chat and that's when I first felt it. A sense of familiarity. This was my coworker, my friend. I felt it so strongly.


*Ah. So this is the story of the first time you met me. The infamous funny story of me going to the wrong Darwin.*


I walked into the school to see, unlike Darwin Elementary, Darwin Middle was adorned in theme colors that matched the dress I was wearing. I probably would have tried to play it up as intentional if I hadn't so obviously been confused my destination.


Waiting in the lobby I asked to use the restroom and as I passed the employee mail boxes I got this weird feeling. Like I saw an apparition of my future self strolling passed.


I apologized profusely for the mix-up. The interviewer was a good-natured science teacher who seemed to take the attitude of ""shit happens"" and didn't judge me too harshly (such an attitude could never have been found at my previous place of employ.)


The interview seemed to be going well. The science teacher was impressed with my answers and with my teaching portfolio (which I'd put a lot of time and money into creating at Office Depot).


When she heard about the work I'd been doing, the work Crystal and I had been doing, she acted like she thought it was insane. At this school district, curricula and lessons are already mostly created.


""Hey, I know you applied for a science position but... Would you be interested in teaching English again? The way we do it here is completely different from how it sounds like they did things at your old school.""


I came back two days later for an interview with a panel of teachers and specialists from the English department.


**The Phone Calls**

After the Darwin Middle interview I headed home. Maybe now, finally a moment to relax.


I began doing some laundry when the phone rang. With one laundry-detergent-contaminated hand aloft, I answered the phone.


It was the principal from Adam's Academy! She was calling to tell me that she'd been extremely impressed with me but would I be willing to take a science position instead of an art position?


I was a little deflated but told her I was interested. She asked me to sit tight and promised she planned on offering me a position today or tomorrow.


I hung up with her and went to go wash my hands. I'd barely applied the soap when my phone rang again.


The secretary at Darwin. I thought I must have forgotten something in the lobby. But, she said the principal was emailing me an offer right away.


Now I was in a conundrum. But it was short lived. I decided to do one more practice drive to Adam's Academy and didn't even get half way there before I decided...


Can't beat the commute to Darwin. Accepted the offer and sent a contrite email to the Adam's Academy principal.


Finally safe. Can finally rest.


**Nostalgia Tour 2019**


Next day...


Visited that church. And the fast food place.


In the restaurant the 17 or 18 year old kid behind the counter asked me ""Are you a teacher?"" ""Yes! How did you know!?"" I asked.


He just stared at me and blinked with angsty teenage sardonicism. ""Do I look like a teacher?"" I asked.


""Yeah."" He said.
He asked me what school I taught at. It was a relief to be able to name one.


At the church I prayed that the Adam's Academy principal would forgive me and find a better candidate.


When I returned home, I had a nice email from her saying that she understood my decision and wished me the best.

Hoping to visit more past places before the summer's out. It feels...deeply relaxing, mesmerizing. Surreal. Threading my future and past together on a string. Leaving future selves for my past self to cross paths with."

I told him about my self harm.

Just a quick reply to his insta story.

I always knew he dealt with self harm, but I didn‚Äôt know when and to what extent.

I told him I was there if he ever needed to talk to someone who understands. And I told him that I‚Äôd been dealing with self harm badly for a while now.

Didn‚Äôt say where when what how why.

He said he appreciated it, and that he wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone.

Now he knows my secret.

I want to protect him but I just don‚Äôt know how and I‚Äôm not close enough. We don‚Äôt come from the same walks of life.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to deal with gender and body dysmorphia like he has.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be gay or trans.

But I want him to do good in life. It‚Äôs this weird instinct. I look up to him for being so brave, and he looks up to me, well, maybe because I‚Äôm older and giving him attention.

I don‚Äôt think his self harm was ever really bad. He‚Äôs posted pictures of his DIY stick and poke tattoos he does over some of the scars. They‚Äôre pale a white, old.

There probably aren‚Äôt many scars‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean he hasn‚Äôt hurt as much.

There are so many scars on me. Scars on top of scars on top of scars.

I still have hope they‚Äôll fade. But I don‚Äôt have hope I‚Äôll ever stop any time soon.

I don‚Äôt have any blades. I found a pair of scissors from a manicure kit and drew some blood with them.

The rubber band shit just makes my wrist swell up for some unexplained reason.

I feel so alone.

I know I can always turn to people online.

But for once in my life, I‚Äôd like to talk to someone about it face to face. With my voice.
My shitty, unreliable voice that never says what I want it to. I just want to talk. For real.

I wish I had more confidence.

But if I had more confidence I wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.

When I feel confident enough to tell someone, I also feel confident that I can stop by myself, so I never tell anyone.

I‚Äôm a failure.

I made SOME progress this year. At least F knows. At least I got that far. At least F knows that my mom died.

But he‚Äôll never know to what extent I struggle. No one ever will. Not my own family. Not any friend.

Not even strangers who read these dumb entries.

I want to write and make art.

That‚Äôll ever be the only way I can capture what I feel. Or at least do it justice.

I just need to be good at it first.

But that takes time. And I hurt NOW.

Fuck."
0,"18.06.19. Feeling good
I didn‚Äôt smoke weed last night!!

I was going to, because I felt like shit. I packed a bowl, got everything ready, even put my shoes on.

Then I looked at myself.

It was a Monday night.

And I remembered what I wrote a few days ago about feeling my feelings.

And I thought: *I could numb myself out.*

But then I kept thinking.

I wasn‚Äôt having flashbacks or nightmares.

I wasn‚Äôt having a panic attack.

I wasn‚Äôt feeling anything so strong I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

So I figured, *Why not just try to sleep this off?*

So I did.

I wrote out all my sadness, felt all my hurt, put on a soothing podcast, and let all the shit just drain out until there was nothing left.

And then, I slept through the whole night!

No nightmares.

No restlessness or waking up.

I just slept, and rested, and recovered.

And then, something else happened that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.

I used to think no one would ever be nice to be if they didn‚Äôt want something from me. That I‚Äôm only worth as much as I can give.

And yesterday, I had nothing left to give.

I was overcome with pain, and when I let that drain out, I was left completely empty.

But I still woke up to nice, supportive messages from kind strangers who didn‚Äôt want to see me suffer.

And my real-life friends told me they wouldn‚Äôt leave me either, even though I‚Äôm a total nut job.

And my math tutor even invited me to dinner tonight, to meet his wife and cat.

(We‚Äôve become friends. It‚Äôs not *that* weird.)

And I realized people like me, even though I don‚Äôt know why.

They want me there, even when I have nothing to give.

And I realized I‚Äôm not alone.

When I‚Äôm empty, there are other people who will fill me back up.

I thought I could never let myself break, because no one would be there to put the pieces back together.

But I was wrong.

Now, I know I can get through this.

And maybe, *just maybe*, everything really will be ok.

...Today, at least, it feels true.

I‚Äôve been telling myself that for ages.

Now, I can finally believe it.

I got 100% on both my practise tests. I might even pass my midterm this week!

And I officially started my volunteer position at the animal shelter yesterday. I got through training.

I‚Äôm officially a Cat Cuddler!

(But I‚Äôm allowed to cuddle all the animals that need socializing. Which is even better!)

I‚Äôve learned a lot this past little while.

I‚Äôm smarter than I think.

I‚Äôm stronger than I seem.

And best of all, I‚Äôm not alone.

I‚Äôve always loved people even when they won‚Äôt love me back. I treat them the way I wish they would treat me.

Because I know what it feels like to be hurt.

I know how bad people are capable of being.

For a long time, it felt like the world was full of only darkness. I assumed everyone would hurt you if you didn‚Äôt give them a reason not to.

I didn‚Äôt want to live in a world where everyone was bad.

But everyone else‚Äôs actions are out of my control.

People will hurt me if they want to, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.

The only way to guarantee to myself that there‚Äôs at least one person who doesn‚Äôt like hurting people is to *be* that person, and hope I find others like me.

So I‚Äôve always tried to be good to others, and do my best to bring out the good in them.

Even when they were bad to me.

...Even when I was bad to myself.

I was good to them.

Or at least, I‚Äôve tried my best to be.

It‚Äôs the only way I can think of to deal with the pain.

Sometimes, being good is the only way to prove to myself that not everyone is bad.

Even when I hate myself for it, for being such a pushover.

Even when I wish they would get a taste of their own medicine, just once, so they could see what it‚Äôs like.

I don‚Äôt want to be the one who gives it to them.

And that helps, to a certain point.

It eases some of the guilt from all my past mistakes.

And it‚Äôs nice to see the people you care about do well.

But it could also get lonely.

Because no one ever cared how I was doing.

I always wondered how long I could keep loving others without them loving me.

I wondered if I was even doing it right.

How could I know how I was actually making them feel, if I‚Äôve never felt it myself?

What if I was hurting them without realizing, and that‚Äôs why they were so awful to me?

...Maybe I was actually a bad person, and that‚Äôs why no one cared about me.

But all I know how to do is keep trying.

I wanted to be good.

At the very least, I wanted to be better.

And trying is better than not trying, even if you‚Äôre bad.

So even though I felt like a failure, I had to keep trying.

But my mind always spun with questions I didn‚Äôt know how to answer.

How many times could I open my heart to others, only to have them rip it right out of my chest?

How many hits could I take, without getting to heal?

What‚Äôs the point of trying to break the cycle if nothing ever changes?

Why do people always still just want to hurt me, no matter what I do?

Sometimes, the questions won.

It made me want to close myself off completely.

And I would give up.

It‚Äôs easier to be alone than constantly beat down.

But I‚Äôve never been able to stop trying for very long.

I can‚Äôt help myself.

I love people.

Even when they don‚Äôt love me.

It makes me happy to see them happy.

And I like being able to help them feel that joy.

I like getting to see their face light up with a smile.

I like getting to see their chest puff out with pride, or their eyes illuminate with passion.

I like getting to see them act like themselves, once they realize I really do like them as they are. People are so fascinating when they start being themselves.

Even if it makes me feel like a pathetic loser so desperate for human connection that I‚Äôll keep letting them hurt me forever.

I‚Äôll still keep doing it.

I don‚Äôt know how to stop.

Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt know that I want to.

I‚Äôd rather be pathetic than hurt people.

Even if it means I just keep getting hurt.

But today, I learned that not everyone just wants to hurt me, even when I think they do.

Today, I learned that it‚Äôs worth it to keep trying.

And I‚Äôm so grateful that I never stopped loving.

Because now, I finally get to feel it, too.

People love me back.

Not all people.

But it only takes one.

And, can you believe it?

I have more than one!"

I wrote a whole entry and deleted it. It was inconsistent and weird.

I went through a roller coaster of a day.

First I woke up and felt worthless because I didn‚Äôt have any ideas for my drawing to etch.

Then I watched this movie that made me cry a shit ton about this girl dying from cancer. It was an awfully directed movie but the story and writing made me cry.

It took me a while to recover after that. I was mad about how I didn‚Äôt get to experience death like the movies. I didn‚Äôt get to hold a dying hand in a hospital. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to watch the life leave them. I never REALLY knew what happened. I didn‚Äôt get a grave to visit and cry over.

It was all not fair. I never even got to say goodbye. Not an I love you. Just fucking nothing.  Maybe that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt been able to really heal. I‚Äôm bitter.

Well enough of me talking about mom for the hundredth time.

I recovered and did some other stuff. Made lunch, watched more tv. Played Minecraft. Usual time killing shit.

I decided I wouldn‚Äôt make some rushed drawing and bring it to school tomorrow to etch. I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself more than I want to see F.

And that was a huge step I think for me. I put what was best for me over my desire to see/talk to F.

I can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs been many if any times I‚Äôve done that this year. I need to take care of my self image sometimes.

At 7 there was a thing at our small group leaders house with all the junior/senior girls. On the way there, we go the same route as F and I did when we drove to the other high school to hang up art for the district show after school that day in April?? May? Idk. I think it was May.

I almost started crying. I really owe a lot to him. I feel like nothing ever changes. I say the same things over and over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù And ‚ÄúThank you so so so much.‚Äù

And you know what? He‚Äôs not perfect, no one is. And that‚Äôs okay!

I‚Äôm worried about next year. It‚Äôs going to be very different. But I hope it‚Äôs a dynamic year like this last one. I feel like things got so much better.

Anyways, next year aside, I‚Äôm here and NOW.

I just gotta make it through each day. I‚Äôm happiest when I can make others happy, I need to start being that person again.

I texted Petra and told her how much I care about her and how thankful I am for our friendship.

We have this semi serious joke that we‚Äôll grow old together as roommates forever living the single life. Men are overrated.

And we‚Äôre both kind of dead serious. I can‚Äôt believe someone actually appreciates my friendship enough to want to live with me.

I always complain about not having a ‚Äúbest friend.‚Äù I have a lot of potential candidates, I just need to put my part into the friendship.

I‚Äôm really lucky to have people. I just wish I had someone I could tell almost everything to. Someone I could be serious with, etc.

Oh, and while I was at the thing at Alyssa‚Äôs house, F texted me to tell me he couldn‚Äôt make it to school this week because he had stuff to do because he was leaving town on Thursday. He said he‚Äôd be back next week though.

I said it was totally fine because I was just about to text him and say I was busy this week and couldn‚Äôt make it.

He said he was glad I wasn‚Äôt disappointed, and that hopefully it would work next week.

I should have told him I was gonna be gone for the next four weeks, but Oh well.

If he tells me later this week/early next week that he‚Äôs going to be at school, I‚Äôll just tell him that then.

I was reading about teachers vs mentors in this book I was reading about art. F is somewhere in the middle for me.

First and foremost, he is my teacher, but all those in between times he‚Äôs been a mentor to me.

Not a mentor as an apprentice is to a master, but more like a student and a role model. It‚Äôs so hard to explain. I wonder if he thinks about me and a mentoree (if that‚Äôs even a word.)

I know I‚Äôm one of his more favorite students, but saying favorite might be pushing it. I know I‚Äôm his most reliable for most things, but I don‚Äôt know about favorite.

I wonder if he‚Äôs scared of me. I do tend to be more emotionally open around him, and let a lot of dark stuff out.

But he can appreciate that sometimes and not think of me as weird. Like that poem I made in the fall semester. ‚ÄúHow to Brainwash the Feeble.‚Äù He thought the poem was really awesome, and he doesn‚Äôt even like poetry that much.

I remember him being genuinely interested in it and asking me questions about it and saying that he didn‚Äôt know I had a talent for writing.

I was amazed.

Maybe I should write more.

It‚Äôs hell of a lot easier than drawing.

I think I‚Äôll make a book. Maybe.

A short book of poems and prints.

OOOOOO
SHIT MAN

That‚Äôs a good idea!!!!!

But I don‚Äôt know if I can top that one poem.

I am proud of the one I wrote recently, but it‚Äôs kind of about him and I can‚Äôt let him read that.

I like this idea. Poems and Prints. A book by me.

I‚Äôll probably call it something else though. Something more serious.

I‚Äôm so excited.

I wish I had someone who loved me unconditionally.

Or even just liked me unconditionally.

But no one does.

Not even if I pay for it - even my therapist ghosted me.

I wish she hadn‚Äôt.

And I wish I had someone to talk to.

Someone who would always be there.

Someone who cared.

But no one cares about me.

I can‚Äôt say I blame them.

I‚Äôm hard to love.

I don‚Äôt have many strengths.

And I have a *lot* of weaknesses.

But I wish someone loved me anyways.

I wish I didn‚Äôt have to get better.

I wish I was already good enough."
0,"Hi! Day 1
Hello! I'm student from Russia. I study in college as a programmer. As my hobby I study C++ and English. I think my English level is about A2. Also I like read book, manga and ranobe, watch films, TV series and anime. I'm bad at communicating with people.

About ganers. I don't like violence, dismemberment and blood, but if it's book I can read that (if there's a bit of it). For example I could not watch the first series of Goblin Slayer, but read manga. I like works that makes me think, but often I look for something lighter like comedy and romance, for example Love is War and Senryuu Girl.

For improve my C++ skill I read math book and implement things from there. I just started and implemented solving linear equations through a matrix, but it works wrong. Need a fix.  Also I think to work on MUD.

Why do I want to keep this diary. I think daily reports will help me to better manage my time and more often study programming and English and not watch TV shows or just waste my time on YouTube.

About today. Today did very little useful. I didn‚Äôt study English or C++, I didn‚Äôt prepare for exams(I have one on June 25 and the second on 27!), I just did ""homework"" (not sure about the correct use of the word) for the college, but I still have to do a report for it, and I didn‚Äôt do it either (I need to do this to 21!).It's a very bad day because of me."
0,"16.06.19. I‚Äôve made a horrible mistake
Back in the day, I was a pretty proficient Tinder-er.

Fastest I ever got from match to mattress was right around 15 minutes.

And I used to fuck a new guy almost every night. It was almost like a bedtime ritual for me.

Get in bed, get on tinder, get a match, get over there, get fucked, then get out before they can find a reason for me to stay the night.

Then I‚Äôd shower away my sins when I got back to my dorm, and fall right asleep.

I never fucked the same guy twice, no matter how many times they texted.

So... I‚Äôve ghosted a *lot* of people.

I‚Äôm not proud of it.

But I always got so worried about what they would say or do if I directly rejected them.

I always thought if I told them ‚Äúno,‚Äù that would make them angry, and then they‚Äôd just take what the wanted by force.

I‚Äôd rather have regretful sex because I couldn‚Äôt say no than get raped because I did. At least then it would be my own choice.

In the end, I got both.

But before that, I didn‚Äôt know how to say no to people.

So when I lost interest, I would treat those boys the way I treated any other problem in my life: ignore it ‚Äòtil it goes away.

I felt pretty bad about it.

But admitting I didn‚Äôt want them anymore felt worse.

So I ghosted.

Then, I got a taste of my own medicine.

My therapist ghosted me.

And it made me feel like fucking garbage.

To All The Boys I‚Äôve Fucked Before:

...Sorry.

(I‚Äôve never loved a boy. But I liked that movie!)

I‚Äôm not gonna hunt down all the guys I‚Äôve ever ghosted and pour my heart out to them about how my shitty past made me do fucked up things.

Not all of them deserve it.

Plenty of them did fucked up things, too.

And honestly, some of them I just don‚Äôt respect enough to bother texting again.

But there‚Äôs a couple boys I‚Äôve reached out and apologized to. They usually take it well.

...So there‚Äôs this guy.

I met him on Tinder last year.

We went on two dates.

The first one was the stuff of fairytales. I honestly can‚Äôt believe it even happened.

He picked me up, and wanted to take me to this secluded hiking trail by the water.

But I knew that was how girls get murdered.

...So I told him that, and he took me somewhere public instead.

We got coffee.

And then we finished getting coffee.

But I was having a pretty good time. So I let him take me to the woods.

For a while, we just walked around in nature, talking and getting to know each other.

We found a hole in the fence and cut under it to climb down the rocks so we could sit by the lake shore.

Then we stayed there, just enjoying each other‚Äôs company while the sun set over the water‚Äôs horizon.

That‚Äôs when I realized I was alone with a strange man in the woods after dark.

Not even on an official path!

I panicked.

So he took my hand, and said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll protect you from the murderers.‚Äù

What a sweet idiot.

He didn‚Äôt even realize it was him I was afraid of.

But I had no choice, so I grabbed his hand and let him hold me close as we walked back through the shadows.

He thought it was cute how jumpy and nervous I was.

I thought it was cute how he hadn‚Äôt raped me yet.

By the time we made it back to the car, I knew I could trust him. If he was gonna do anything, he would have done it in the forest.

So when he drove me home, and he actually got out of his car to open the door for me, I leaned up against the hood and said, ‚ÄúThanks for tonight. I had fun.‚Äù

And he said, ‚ÄúSo did I.‚Äù

Then I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in.

He was a good kisser.

But on the second date, he took me back to his motel to watch a movie.

And when he got hard and climbed on top of me and tried to take my shirt off, I freaked out.

I managed to hold myself together until I left.

But I never texted him again.

And once my therapist stopped responding to me, I realized how awful I must have made him feel.

Especially because I *specifically* told him I wouldn‚Äôt ghost. I said it was rude, and I wouldn‚Äôt do that to him.

So yesterday, I sent him a text to apologize.

And we started talking.

And then today, *he asked me out!*

And *I said yes!*

What the fuck did I just do?

I haven‚Äôt been on a date since that guy pulled a knife on me and I finally deleted my Tinder account.

I haven‚Äôt had sex in almost a year.

I haven‚Äôt had sex without also having a panic attack in even longer.

And I haven‚Äôt worked through any of my shit.

The assessment lady said I have ‚Äúattachment issues‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm qualified to date.

Am I just gonna hurt this boy, again?

...Is he gonna hurt me?

I shouldn‚Äôt have said yes.

But I‚Äôm just so fucking sick of being broken.

I want to be normal.

And normal 19 year olds go on dates.

Normal 19 year olds have boyfriends.

Normal 19 year olds fall in love.

Normal 19 year olds don‚Äôt feel too disgusting to be touched by another person.

So when he said he‚Äôd like to see me again, I didn‚Äôt let myself recoil in fear and tell him ‚Äúno‚Äù.

I used every excuse I could think of to scare him off.

I told him I haven‚Äôt been on a date since last October.

He said he hasn‚Äôt, either.

I told him I‚Äôve gained weight since the last time he saw me.

He said he didn‚Äôt care, he just liked my personality.

I told him I was raped, and that we would need to take things slowly.

He said he‚Äôll always stop when I say ‚Äústop‚Äù.

I asked him out on the spot.

We‚Äôre getting coffee next week."

I don't know. I think I am the problem. I get bored too easily. Maybe it's me not putting enough effort in?

He's not that bad of a guy. He is an amazing dad, he's helped me with so much. But I don't know.

Maybe we fell out of love? Maybe we were never in it.

Love is a feeling that I really don't want to experience.

Yeah yeah yeah everyone gets their heart broke and blah blah blah. But seriously. I'll like/love someone but it's never the way I see other people feeling it.
It's so much easier not feeling anything at all.
That's why I am always there for everyone.
Their problems first and hopefully I'll forget mine.

I'm okay. I promise. I'll always always always be okay."
0,"16.06.19. Father‚Äôs Day
It‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day today, which means I watched the kids while my dad watched basketball.

Seeing them makes my heart hurt.

It‚Äôs the little things.

Like when someone grabbed the two year old and started tickling him and didn‚Äôt stop when he said, ‚ÄúNo! Stop!‚Äù

...But that‚Äôs a personal one.

When I was molested, it started with tickling.

He didn‚Äôt stop then, either.

I know that‚Äôs not what was happening to the baby. But I always have to stop myself from puking when I watch it happen. Even writing about it now makes it hard to breathe.

Why don‚Äôt adults ever stop?

There were other things, too.

Like when the four year old casually mentioned she hadn‚Äôt eaten yet today. It was 3pm.

I asked one of the adults to feed her.

She responded: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Like when the seven year old asked why I wanted to give her a hug. Usually no one does.

I gave her so many hugs today.

Like when the eight year old was told by the adults to stop complaining about her tummy hurting, instead of being looked after.

I kissed it better for her.

That was all she wanted.

Like when the eleven year old got so excited that I *wanted* to listen to him talk about his interests.

When the thirteen year old swelled with pride when I asked to see the photography she put on Instagram.

When the fourteen year old was so grateful that I ate dinner and watched TV with him.

When the seventeen year old stayed in my room until 3am telling me why she can‚Äôt sleep at night.

When my mom came into my room to berate me because she stepped on something and hurt her foot.

...She‚Äôs gotten better since our fight, though.

She only yelled for 30 seconds before she stopped herself and left.

It‚Äôs confusing, because we‚Äôre happy.

No one‚Äôs really in danger.

No one‚Äôs actually starving or in dire need of medical attention or any other kind of attention.

We‚Äôre looked after.

There‚Äôs just a certain disinterest in our well-being.

You can hear it in the way my dad mindlessly says, ‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù when the kids try to talk to him.

You can see it in the way no one watches when they run outside. The older ones just watch the younger ones, and everyone trusts each other to stay on the property.

You can even see it in how the dog lights up when I pet him. Usually everyone just ignores him.

How the cat has started biting more since I left, and shies away from being pet now.

It makes me sad, because there‚Äôs nothing I can do except love them as much as I can and hope it‚Äôs enough.

Our home is the best place for them. CPS wouldn‚Äôt do anything except disturb us and anger the adults.

Social workers never get that, though.

They just think I‚Äôm a bad person for refusing to tell them the details I know they would report.

But if I‚Äôm the bad guy, then so be it.

What they want to do is worse.

They don‚Äôt really care about doing what‚Äôs best.

They just care about following procedure, no matter what that means for us.

Sometimes, I still wish I could tell someone. Just to bounce my stories off of, to see if they‚Äôre even bad.

But there‚Äôs no one.

The seven year old is going to camp for a month.

She asked me to send her letters.

Last year, no one sent her any."

I‚Äôm a new father and have an amazing wife and one year old son but I feel so empty right now. I miss my friends. I miss my mom. I resent my father. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. It‚Äôs been that way for far too long. I have no desire to do things I used to. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I miss my mom so much. There‚Äôs too much old pain inside. The abuse I took from relatives as a child. The ridiculing and bullying during school. The lack of direction and focus I‚Äôve had since my mom passed just won‚Äôt go away. I love my son. I love my wife. I haven‚Äôt been the same me that she signed up to spend the rest of her life with. I feel like I‚Äôve let her down by not being able to overcome my issues but for some reason I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to her. I used to tell myself that everything would end up ok because I had been through so much that I was too strong to be brought down. Now I feel like the weight of everything is becoming to much for me. I feel exhausted all the time. I feel alone. I feel withdrawn and depressed. I‚Äôve been battling depression for years and it always seems to come back around any holiday. Mother‚Äôs Day reminds me of my mom and how much I miss her. Christmas reminds me of the family that I had that doesn‚Äôt speak to each other anymore. Father‚Äôs Day just reminds me that I‚Äôm not loved by my father and that I have nobody to look to for help. Nobody to turn to when things get tough. I know I can talk to my wife but she has so much on her plate already that I feel bad bringing my past shit back around because we‚Äôve gone over it so many damn times. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Am I ever going to be happy and myself again? What happened to all my friends? My best friend is now homeless and a drug addict. My older brother that I looked up to for so long won‚Äôt talk to me anymore because I stopped answering his drunken phone calls at 2 am. Now he‚Äôs moved back to Ohio and I feel like we may never be brothers again in this life  like we used to. I miss my sister. Sometimes I feel like running and being by myself but I can‚Äôt because I love my son and would never do to him what my father did to me which is abandon me. I‚Äôm unhappy but I can‚Äôt give up. I feel like all I do is work then come home and hangout with the baby then go back to work again. I have no hobbies. I have no passion. I have no dreams. I have what I have and I‚Äôm grateful for it, but it‚Äôs simply not enough right now to overcome my past and all that pain. I feel like it hurts too much to look at the past but I‚Äôve been through too much to let go of it. It‚Äôs a part of me. It‚Äôs how I became what I am. How can I let go of the pain if its who I am? How can I become a better person? How can I find my old passion, my old dreams, my joy in life again? I always find ways to fuck things up that are good for me. Like I‚Äôm so used to suffering that I don‚Äôt know or even want to live without it. I see people all together with their family and I think that I can bring that to my life if I keep trying, but what to do till then? My lack of desire and energy has had an affect on my relationships to the point that I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre all just gonna fall apart. They always seem to. I literally have no real friends left that are within 1000 miles of where I live. Nobody seems to ask me to do anything anymore. Am I that bad that nobody has any interest in being my friend? Can they see the pain in me and just would rather not deal with it? Is it because I‚Äôm too withdrawn? Even at work where I have people I supervise they don‚Äôt seem to care much about me. I feel insignificant and lost. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore or remember who I wanted to be and how to become that person. I‚Äôm truly lost and lonely. My son brings me the only joy I find in life anymore. The only things I look forward to are what he‚Äôs gonna do with his life. I want to be the father he deserves. I want to be the husband she deserves. I want to become the person I deserve to be. I just don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Nobody seems to take me seriously anymore and I‚Äôm afraid my son will see it. I‚Äôm afraid he won‚Äôt look up to me when he gets older. That he‚Äôll see me as a failure and a bum. That I‚Äôm just another boring old dad with no dreams, no ambition and no fun to be around. I‚Äôm more afraid of that than anything. But how do I turn things around when I have no direction nor do I have the energy to accomplish anything I do set my mind to? I don‚Äôt feel whole. I feel like a shell. Like I‚Äôm just going through the motions of life waiting for the end. I need help. I need someone to talk to. I need to have some release of all this. I haven‚Äôt had real fun in years.

I haven't posted here in a while. Honestly, I'm choosing to post here because I went through my subs trying to figure out which one would be best for what I have to way, and it was either this one or r/casualconversation, and the thought of posting there just gave me anxiety because I worried that maybe 50+ people would respond and I think I'd feel obligated to reply to a certain number of them or something, and I've been getting into an increasingly internet-quiet/typing-quiet mood over the past year.

Anywho.. It just occurred to me that I feel like it's crazy that we spend our whole childhood supposedly preparing for adulthood, but I've been here for a whole year now and I feel like I'm still going ""The hell is this?"", ""The hell is that?"", and ""That is not at all what I thought it was.""

And I know I'm far more prepared than a lot of people at this time. I have money management skills and a college education, a job, and some home economics know how. Beyond that though, I've been starting from scratch.

It took the whole year, but I *think* I just about understand how romantic relationships are supposed to work.

At the moment, I feel like the most unfortunate thing is that I explicitly remember my parents mentioning when I was a child that it was weird to stay friends with people from high school or college after the fact. But here I am, post-college realizing that the ability to meet people once you're no longer in school drastically decreases because you're no longer forced to go to a place that has hundreds of people who are your own age every day. So it probably would have been beneficial to have picked up a few more friends or to have had some better friendships during high school and college so that I would have been inclined to make them a bigger part of my life now. It wouldn't have been weird or inappropriate like they said, it would have been a fantastic idea. *rolls eyes*

Unrelated to that, I keep feeling like my brain is too tired for everything I want to do, and I find that particularly annoying.

I feel like there's a super long list of stuff that I got wrong as I was growing up that I want to remember to tell my children one day, but I'm really worried that I'm going to forget it all, so I'm going to have to write it down. But this is one of those things. I do want my kids to take their education very seriously, almost as seriously as I did, but friends are so important. Being friends with specific people who dress a certain way isnt important and being friends with everyone isnt important but have somewhere between one and a few really close friends is really important."

It‚Äôs so late. I need to get off the fucking toilet and shower.

The clothes I ordered came in the mail today while I was at work. When I got home and opened it the first thing that fell out of the big white bag was the blue dress.

God that dress, it‚Äôs slightly different in person but not too noticeable. It‚Äôs the perfect length, and fits me pretty good for being a fat ugly bitch.

If curl my hair and put on my new sandals, I‚Äôll be the most beautiful I‚Äôve ever felt.

Everything else I ordered fit except for two pairs of shorts. I got the wrong style on accident. I‚Äôll have to return those sometime this week and order new shorts tomorrow.

I‚Äôm so happy!!!!

It sounds so materialistic of me, but I RARELY ever am able to find this many clothes that fit me and are cheap and comfortable.

I think I‚Äôll send the sweat shorts back. I‚Äôd rather spend the money on a better pair of black shorts.

I feel so good. Today was good.

I can‚Äôt wait to wear my dress to church. I hope the spaghetti straps won‚Äôt be an issue.

Maybe I‚Äôll wear a jacket."

I had a breakdown last night.

I was at home, though, so I couldn‚Äôt make any noise.

I couldn‚Äôt smoke any weed.

I couldn‚Äôt drink or cut or kill myself.

I couldn‚Äôt do any of the things I usually do when everything starts feeling like too much.

So I went on one of those free online counselling chat services, where you text someone anonymously.

I had no choice.

I had to do something.

And I knew I couldn‚Äôt do it myself.

I started off fairly calm and reasonable, just saying I needed help calming down.

But the counsellor didn‚Äôt get everything I was talking about, because I started my story in the middle.

So she asked me for some background info.

Why did I get diagnosed with PTSD?

Why did I need help with school?

Why couldn‚Äôt I talk to my parents about all this?

Why was I so upset tonight?

And I just fucking lost it.

I told her everything.

It started off kind of coherent, and then it quickly descended into one long emotional ramble.

I was a mess.

I don‚Äôt even know when I started crying. I didn‚Äôt even notice it until I tasted tears that had dripped down my face into my mouth.

It all just flowed out of me.

Tears, feelings, snot, pain, memories.

I sat on the floor in my dark bedroom for an hour.

(I had to keep the lights off so my family would think I was asleep and not bother me. They bought it, even though it was only 9pm.)

Everything hit me all at once.

And illuminated by the dim, lonely glow of my laptop screen, I fell apart.

I sat and I cried, because there was nothing else for me to do. There was no way for me to stop it.

So I poured out my soul to this random, apathetic stranger on the internet.

She barely said a word, and I ignored what little she did have to say.

(‚ÄúHave you tried picturing a calm ocean breeze?‚Äù)

(Fuck you, bitch.)

And when it was over, I didn‚Äôt feel any better.

I just felt drained.

But I had no tears left to cry.

And I was sick of sitting on the floor.

So I brushed myself off, put on my coziest pyjamas, grabbed a few soft stuffies, and went to sleep.

And today, when I woke up, I felt better.

I think I finally understand the point of talking about your feelings.

Terrible timing, since my therapist just ghosted me.

But I‚Äôm taking this as a new beginning.

...No, not a beginning.

The story would have to end for me to start a new one.

And I‚Äôm far from the end of this.

But I‚Äôm turning the page.

It‚Äôs a new chapter.

My demons will keep chasing me forever if I keep running. I‚Äôve always been so afraid of what will happen if I let them catch up to me.

But last night, I couldn‚Äôt run.

I couldn‚Äôt hide.

I thought if I ever stopped running, the demons would catch me and drag me down and destroy me.

But then I had no choice but to give in. So I let my demons overcome me and do what they wanted.

And something unexpected happened.

They had their way with me. They made me feel unbelievable pain, helplessness, despair.

But then, they let go.

And I was fine.

I thought you let go of the past by trying to escape it.

I thought facing my demons would be giving up.

I‚Äôve been running as fast as I can, trying not to let them win. Trying to be strong enough to always outrun them, to never let them get close enough to hurt me.

I thought they were too strong, and I‚Äôd have to run far enough that I could avoid them, so I wouldn‚Äôt lose.

I never thought I could fight back.

I just assumed there was no point.

I thought they would break me in a second.

That wearing those wounds would be a failure on my part, for letting them hurt me.

I thought if they caught me, they would drag me down forever, and I would be stuck with all that pain.

But I wasn‚Äôt.

And they didn‚Äôt.

It turns out, they never really wanted to fight at all.

They were only chasing me because I‚Äôm *their* escape.

Once I let them out, they were free.

And so was I."

I dream of art camp.

It sounds cheesy to call it that, although that‚Äôs what it essentially is. A better name would be like, ‚Äúhigh intensity three week fully immersive college credit art course.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt call it by it‚Äôs name here. So for now, it‚Äôs ‚Äúart camp.‚Äù

Three short weeks doing some of my favorite things. I‚Äôll take Printmaking, where we‚Äôll dive into silkscreen, relief carving, lithography, intaglio, and more.

Life drawing where I‚Äôll do tons of drawings of still lives, live models, other people, sketches and doodles galore.

My mystery elective, which will probably be either photography or experimental painting. I hope I‚Äôll learn a lot from either of those. I don‚Äôt know what to expect.

Creative writing and art history! I‚Äôm not 100% sure on the art history though.

On top of that they have professional practice seminars and talks and will teach us practical ways to get into college.

I‚Äôm so excited. I can see myself sitting in the printmaking department at my own little table. Working away at some print or drawing.

I can see myself sitting alone in the grass against some building sketching or talking with people.

I can see myself sleeping at night wondering if my roommate is asleep.

It‚Äôll probably be totally different from what‚Äôs in my head though.

Oh but most importantly, I can see myself at the exhibition night on the last night. A small section of the white walls in the gallery space entirely devoted to my artwork. I can see myself nervously standing around in my blue dress. Wondering if I hung up my art the right way, wandering if my family will think my art is stupid. Waiting for someone I know to wander into the gallery. ‚Äî hoping it‚Äôs F.

I PRAY I won‚Äôt be socially awkward the first couple of days. I PRAY I make a good impression upon teachers and the adults there. I hope I make friends, not weird ones, but chill ones.

Ahhhh I‚Äôm so so excited I just had to gush a little.

I really want to impress people. Just a little."

I set a deadline for myself. Tuesday.

I texted F and asked if he would be at school any days next week. I need to get two plates beautifully etched before I go to camp.

I want an etching or so I can be really, truly proud of and in love with.

He said he‚Äôd be there Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday. But Wednesday I‚Äôm already going roller skating with P and A.

And Alyssa wants to get together. Fuck. I don‚Äôt have time for another breakdown like last time. I‚Äôll just lie. Tell her my bible reading has been good.

But that‚Äôll have to be Thursday or Friday.

I can‚Äôt do Monday because I need a day to draw my plates. And I need the weekend to come up with ideas.

... Wow I‚Äôm so busy.

I wish I weren‚Äôt. I wish I had one more week to relax, think, draw.

Camp is the 26th. I‚Äôll probably spend all of the 25th packing and working and being all excited.

I really wanted to get together with Lindsey like we had talked about. But that‚Äôll have to be in August if it works with her.

After church camp I have three days to rest/get ready for a family reunion and my 3 week art camp.

At the end of the art camp, there is an exhibition  where we get to show off a bit of the work we‚Äôve made at the camp.

Obviously I‚Äôll invite my parents, maybe grandparents, although I wish I didn‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôll invite F, I know he said he wants to come. Or at least he SAID that. I‚Äôm thinking about inviting Lindsey or Alyssa, it just depends.

I bought this beautiful dress from H&M. It hasn‚Äôt arrived yet, and I really, really hope it fits. It‚Äôs just beautiful in its own unique way. It looks like a cyanotype and I love it. [https://m2.hm.com/m/en_us/productpage.0744893005.html](https://m2.hm.com/m/en_us/productpage.0744893005.html)

...

I remembered I was also going to play D&D with the gang on Thursday night so I texted the group chat to see when and where and found out S was in a bad car accident and is in the ER.

There‚Äôs an awful bruise on her neck and a shit ton of glass went into her hand. I feel so bad for her. I want to cry. I know she‚Äôs tough as shit but I can‚Äôt imagine how scary that‚Äôd be. Her car is completely totaled.

So I don‚Äôt know if we will meet Thursday. Most likely not. But I‚Äôll leave the time open just in case.

Now I‚Äôm meeting with Alyssa Thursday morning.

Jesus fucking Christ what a week.

And I‚Äôm going to my grandparents on Sunday!

I didn‚Äôt even realize I had so much going on until I sat down to write this. I thought I had more time. Summer is going FAST. I really don‚Äôt have time to waste playing mine fucking craft.

My life is never this interesting.

For the first time in my life, I have a life.

And I could have done so much more if I wanted to. OH and Milla said that me, her and C should get together sometime this summer.

I just want to scream and run back to my introverted turtle shell.

The issue with me is I like the idea of friends, I just don‚Äôt like all the maintenance. If only I had like one or two close friends.

...

I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. I had so much I wanted to do before camp, and I have barely scratched the surface.

I need to return my library books.

I need to shop for bras.

I need to etch two plates.

I need to finish my charcoal Drawing.

I need to finish ‚ÄúThe View.‚Äù

I need to finish that other book by David Bales.

I need to finish them before Tuesday because I told F that I‚Äôd let him borrow it. I can probably get a lot of reading done in the car Sunday.

I need to clean my room.

I need to get my hair dyed. (24th)

I need to figure out which days I requested off because I forgot.

Read my fuckin bible so I have something to talk with Alyssa about.

AgHhhh and so much more I haven‚Äôt even remembered that I need to do.

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane.

I‚Äôm just going to cool down. Drink some water. Finish that podcast. Lay in bed.

0,"14.06.19. My worst nightmare
I barely slept last night, but around 5 or 6am I finally managed to fall asleep.

I had a nightmare.

My stomach is still in knots from it.

In it, I lost the little note inside my locket, the one my 7 year old cousin gave me.

The note she wrote that says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.

The one she asked me to keep in the locket and wear forever so she would always be in my heart, even when I had to leave.

The one she checks I‚Äôm still wearing every time she sees me.

She always gets so suspicious I‚Äôve lost it or taken it off. It crushes her to think I don‚Äôt really love her, or that I‚Äôve forgotten about it (and by extension, her) completely.

And she‚Äôs always happy when I show her I‚Äôm still wearing it and she sees that I still love her.

In the dream, I lost the note.

Outside, in the wet grass.

Everyone else who was there was busy enjoying themselves. They were having a scavenger hunt.

(It was a dream, ok? It had weird parts.)

But I refused to join.

I had to find the note.

But no matter how long or hard I searched, no matter how many false hopes when I found other slips of paper in the grass, I just couldn‚Äôt find it.

It was gone.

My mom came out and told me to stop looking.

She told me I was ruining the scavenger hunt for everyone else, to stop crying and go join them, that my cousin wouldn‚Äôt be that upset.

After all, she‚Äôs just a kid.

Kids don‚Äôt remember things.

Kids don‚Äôt get upset.

That‚Äôs what my mom said in the dream.

But all I could think was: *Don‚Äôt you care?*

I was sobbing on the grass.

I‚Äôd lost the most important thing I have.

It was going to hurt my cousin.

My mom didn‚Äôt care about any of that.

She just wanted me to stop ruining her good time.

When I wouldn‚Äôt stop crying and join her, my mom scoffed at me and left.

So I stayed where I was, endlessly, desperately searching for the note through my tear-stained vision, until my alarm went off.

When I woke up, I opened the locket.

The note was still nestled there, right in place.

But the terror still hasn‚Äôt faded.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had a nightmare I can‚Äôt wake up from.

I‚Äôve had dreams about all the worst things I can think of. And I can think of lots of awful things.

But this one was worse than all the others.

This one didn‚Äôt stop when I woke up.

My worst nightmare is hurting the kids."

Just going to ramble.

Recently it was my sister's birthday. I got her a 3ds game, Persona Q2, because she had been playing Persona 5 a lot on my PS4. I didn't have to get her anything since I told her that her bday present was to go see BTS in concert and I also paid for her friend's ticket. But... I still wanted to get her something. She likes it. :)

Also everyone in the house is sick except me. I don't think I could afford to get sick since I'm still recovering from surgery.

Speaking of surgery. I'm on week 4 since surgery. I can't eat too much because it will hurt my stomach, kind of like how someone feels when eating too much food. A bloated feeling, but for me it's actual pain. üòÖ I was just so hungry though... I only eat carbs in an emergency and there wasn't really anything healthy to eat.

Anywho, I got several packages today.

One was for my sis from my other sis for her bday, so I wrapped it up and gave it after singing happy birthday. My sis thanked me for wrapping it. I didn't expect the package, what a surprise and right on her birthday!

Another was a kpop trade - a few photocards. The person I traded with is so kind... I'm glad I got back in touch with her. üò¢ I kind of look up to her. I never really told her that since I don't want to have a relationship where one is on a pedestal, you know? But I'm happy she's still so nice to me and I can talk about merch with her.

The package I opened after that was for an out of print game I bought for the Vita. It was hard to find a copy that wasn't $55 so I checked Mercari and luckily found one about $48. I mean it's not that much cheaper but it was also domestic so I went for it. It's in English but was only released in Asia. I played it a little, it's been fun. I have the PS4 version but I prefer handheld games since I don't have to wear glasses like I do for my tv.

My last package was from my favorite group BTS. I bought 2 dvds - Love Yourself dvd New York and dvd Europe. I don't have the Seoul one... I also don't have the exhibition book. Anyway, I pulled Taehyung's photocard for New York and I thought it was hilarious because it was a closeup of his face. For Europe I pulled Jimin's photocard. It is so cute! I love the blue hair and his selfie game is strong. Definitely keeping it. I didn't even pull my bias's photocard but that's okay I guess. Ironically I always pull maknae line and hardly pull my own bias.

That's all for now. üôÇ"

I kept thinking back on what i wrote yesterday. I dont really regret it, though my grammar could be fixed and my sentence structure could be better.

Anyways

This whole moving situation is very stressful, my roommate is still moving and i still dont want tk go back to my grandma. Theres a lot of bad memories in that house, mostly pain. A lot of emotional pain really. My grandmotger has always been a strong woman, but it seems like the years as well as karma has caught up to her. She has many illnesses, the ones i know are high blood pressure, diabetes, knee replacement, obesity, depression, the discs in her spine are unaligned. She was a great mom, she made sure i was clean and always fed, but she was very abusive towards me. I think it's because she had a lot of emotions from her past coming out. My mom told me that when my grandmother was a kid she was blamed for one of her sisters catching fire. Her and her sister were playing in the attic/top room of her home in Mexico. Being that this was 50+years ago electric light bulbs weren't really a thing. She was playing with her sister in a blanket tent they made. My grandmother accidentally knocked over a candle, that fell on the blanket, which was ontop of her sister, and she was ablaze. Panicking they both screamed and the sister flailed about wrapping the blanket around herself. The adults came running at the sound of the girls shrieks, and managed to smother the flames. The worst part is that they unwrapped her in one pull of the melted blanket, skinning the little girl in front of everyone. They took her to the hospital, she had 3rd degree burns on over 70% of her body and she lived. Everyone blamed my grandmother. My grandmother carried that guilt with her all her life, influencing her in her later years into an abusive relationship with my grandfather. My grandfather doesnt talk much or at all about his childhood. He tells me he'd be badly beaten by his dad and his mom was a drunk...

I dont really wanna talk anymore, my friends are picking me up in a little bit. We're going to ignite, I just wanna forget about my problems for the night.

I decided to go on a walk. I brought my sketchbook just in case. I really didn‚Äôt come across people. I wanted to be alone, but my reasons for being alone were more fear driven than anything so I decided to face my fears and I didn‚Äôt turn on the street I usually do.

I kept walking down the busy road to the tiny shopping area. Down to the Starbucks.

I felt like every single car was watching me, and they probably were. I felt so paranoid. When I crossed the street I felt every pair of eyes on me. Judging me.

When I walked into Starbucks it felt oddly familiar. I used to come down to draw there in the evenings during the school year. I always see this one girl/guy who works there. I don‚Äôt know their name but they‚Äôre usually polite.

I ordered the smallest drink I could and sat outside on the patio. It was empty except for two older women chatting over coffee.

It was nice. Starbucks IS nice. I felt underdressed in my gray T-shirt and DIY jean shorts. I had no makeup on. I felt bare.

I started to draw and fucked up so I scribbled shit all over the page. I listened to the two women talk briefly. They started talking about another woman who was an art professor or something. One of the ladies said she used to do art but it gave her so much anxiety each time she would start something that she just quit.

I tried not to smile. I didn‚Äôt want them to realize I was listening.

This mother and her son sat down at a table. The son was reading this giant book on Caesar. The kid must‚Äôve been no older than 11 or 12.

Every once and a while he would stop reading and energetically tell his mom about something he read or some crazy fact.

His mom left for a while and the kid moved across from me to a different chair and kept reading.

I decided to do some quick gesture sketches of him and other people who were sitting there. After a while there were no people.

I saw a mother and her two daughters from church. They‚Äôre so old now. I remember being there at the court the day they were adopted. I even babysat for them once.

I shyly said hi and kept drawing. I waited till they left to go back in, order another drink, and I sat inside in the air conditioning.

I drew some more people then my drawings got worse and worse the more bored I got.

I decided to leave and I crossed the street.

On a whim I decided to open the gate and go into the small plot of graveyard fenced inside the middle of a giant parking lot. It was large enough to sit unseen by the passing traffic.

I sat down against a tree. The light danced across the unkept grass. I drew for a little while. I was trying to get over my fear of bugs. There weren‚Äôt a ton but I started to get pretty anxious so I got up and left when my pencil ran out of lead.

I walked fast home. This small group of middle school boys were 50 ft behind me following me down the sidewalk.

I was gone around 3 1/2 hours.

It was so nice to be away from my sister all afternoon.

I listened to a podcast or two. Read half of a book. Ate some pizza for lunch.

Overall it was a good day.

It‚Äôs not over.

But I felt so at peace in that little historical graveyard. A place where people were buried over a hundred years ago.

Headstones with people who have been dead longer than I‚Äôve been alive.

It was like this morbid community of death.

A place like this is where my mom was supposed to be. Where she should be.

Not ashes in an urn.

But I didn‚Äôt really think of death. I just was overwhelmed with the beauty of the place. How quiet and alone I was, yet surrounded by a busy street, and technically in the middle of a grocery store parking lot.

I should shower now. My sister said I stink.

She‚Äôs probably right. I don‚Äôt know if I put on deodorant this morning.

I did wash my face though.

I want to stay up late tonight if I can.

When the joke was over, I went back to my room and my friends headed back downstairs.

And as we separated, my housemate casually said: ‚ÄúLove you!‚Äù

And I casually said back: ‚ÄúYeah, you too.‚Äù

It was so natural, I almost didn‚Äôt even notice what just happened.

It wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

It just *was*.

Even though I‚Äôm broken.

I can‚Äôt believe they love me back!"

I feel like life is slipping from me.

I don‚Äôt see the point of things anymore.

I got up early. Did my laundry, drank extra water, went on a walk,  showered and listened to a podcast. I did all the shit they say to do to get out of a funk.

And I still feel equally empty inside. I‚Äôm just clean. That‚Äôs all.

I tried to force myself to feel good, but it all seems so hopeless. I feel like things will never change. Or at least this sadness will never go.

I‚Äôll have it with me for the rest of my life. My sweet mother. I miss her so much. I say that every day but it‚Äôs fucking true.

I miss her every day. It‚Äôs been more than a year without her now. Tomorrow would have been her funeral.

That god damn funeral.

I thought I was SO strong.

But you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve got until it‚Äôs gone. And the longer she‚Äôs gone, the more it hurts.

I keep having urges but I need a new blade.

Mine is old and rusting. The tip broke and is no longer sharp like it once was.

I tried the fucking rubber band trick. Made my wrist swell up.

[This](https://prnt.sc/o15pvn) was from four snaps. My skin is weird as shit. Now it itches. I hate myself. I hate my body. I wish I were a ghost.

I could float around, fly through walls, and I wish I could read thoughts. Life would be so much more interesting.

If only it were that way.

I kinda don‚Äôt care about writing down the actually events that happened today. Or any day. I‚Äôm kind of done.

But I will because that‚Äôs why I started doing this in the first place. So no day of my life would be totally and completely lost or forgotten.

I woke up. Made some breakfast. Drank some water. Put my clothes in the wash. Went for a mile and a half walk. Listened to a 99% invisible podcast about this painting. Came home. Put another load in the wash. Ate lunch. Watched TV. Went to church. Came home.

My day was boring. I didn‚Äôt do anything meaningful today.

I wish I were dead.

Not because I‚Äôm bored.

Because I feel dead on the inside."

Have you heard of Sylvia Plath? I'm obsessed with her, especially her semi-autobiographical book 'The Bell Jar'. I feel like Esther, reading about Esther, how accomplished she is, how alone she feels. I'm not alone; I have incredible friends, loving parents, and a great boyfriend. I've somehow managed to achieve everything I wanted, and I'm working on what I wish to achieve. I'm privileged, and I'm an insufferable attention-seeker if I claim any kinship with Plath. I refuse to belittle her like that. But what am I trying to say through all these muddled words? I want to be left alone, and I don't want to be left alone. I know I should reply to texts, but I feel like an empty shell - nothing I say is of any consequence. I have my whole life laid out in front of me, like a noose that I can't undo. It's closing in on me, and all this love is suffocating me. What a selfish pig, what a drama queen. What do you do when you reach the point when can't trust your thoughts, your emotions? I just want to end it all, but even that is not in my control. That's the cruelest truth - there's no such thing as free will. Am I here writing this, or am I really cutting? Or is that my head splattered on the road? I don't know, my thoughts are too vivid and they scare me. I can't even bring myself to reply to my therapist. It's hilarious I'm stressing about letting her down.  My fingers are a mess. I've chewed and peeled my skin until they are red and raw. I can't wash dishes, and I'm positively howling if I have to squeeze a lemon. It's hilarious - I want the pain, but I also don't want it. Plus, people notice. I guess I'm going to have to bring gloves back into fashion. Maybe I could waltz in a blue gown and then kill myself. How poetic. And so dramatic. If anything, I'm at least consistent."

I dont really know how to start this off, maybe something will come of this, maybe I'll be famous. All I know is life has proven itself to be very difficult.
I am in actuality very sad and very lonely and maybe putting these words in an anonymous public forum will make me feel less lonely? Who knows.
 This all bullshit, i know what to put down on this keyboard its whether or not i will allow myself to express and finally admit my feelings. I'm very insecure and i think there might be something wrong with me, im not entirely sure. Im not sure of anything because im afraid of being attached to things  ecause thats when things are able to leave because nothing sticks around forever. I just think its a little funny how that seems to be the path and theme of my life sometimes. Its hypocrisy and abandonment.
 I hate when i see people succeed because deep down i know i can do what they do, I'm not stupid, I just have no motivation or confidence in myself. I know i have so much potential to do anything, but will I? Will i ever get off my ass and do something with it? Maybe. I thought i could if i found someone to believe in me, I thought it would be my girlfriend but that doesnt really seem to be working. I dont know how I feel. I met this girl off of Tinder, the 1st date of the dozens of people i tried to talk to. I took off with what i could and i think i regret it. I cant bring myself to let go, and i cant be honest with myself, im not entirely sure if i ""love"" this girl because im so damn afraid of being alone. But i do miss who i used to be, i was so creative, i would make some beautiful ass drawings, at least something id be proud of myself for, id would stay up all night smoking , listening to music that i could feel in my soul and in my bones. I would be so happy to see what i can make. I just dont feel that anymore. I think its because im dissapointed in myself.
Today is my 1 year anniversary with this girl, and i dont know what to do with my life. I hope shes not pregnant because i can't afford to have a kid, i dont wanna put them in the system either. I thi k we might take a visit to planned parenthood and after that i can finally find the excuse to split this up because i have no time for myself, i am stretched between my friends my 32+hours a week of work, responsibilities, my familt that im trying to put back together.
I got kicked out of my grandmas a couple years ago, she caught me smoking weed in the back porch, she told me to get out and gave me a look like i was my mom. My mom had drug and alcohol problems. I cant afford to see a therapist and my insurance doesnt cover one i think. I dont even bother to check, thats how seld destructove i am.
This might be alot for me to let go of, or maybe its not enough. I dont remember where i heard this but it went something like ""change happens when we are more uncomfortable with who we are than who we could be"" and goddam am i uncomfortable. I find a lot of comfort in rap. The emotional kind, not emo rap, im talking about when artists talk about how they really feel when everything gets quiet and you become aware of what is going on inside you. Geeze im really fucking stressed and full of anxiety and im really trying. The shit is just so damn hard

Is it just me, or is it that when you try to open up to people who's been hurting you, instead of consoling you, they will try to put the blame on you?

Is it bad to crave for their attention? Like: ""hey, i am hurting because of your actions. Maybe you can be as illogical as I am and try to understand me?""

Is it wrong to expect them for compassion instead of logic?

Is it just me? Am I wrong this time?

Am I wrong again?"

Every time she finds something to torture me ... Maybe because I still love her ...
After so much time it took me to get used to it without her ..but all in vain my all scars are wet again ... I want to die now... rather living with this pain ... How can someone be so selfish ??
She called me multiple times today and after getting annoyed  I received it .

When she just started I realized how far we are from each other. Its been months i havent listened to her voice. And all of sudden she called and the pain I felt after that 38 seconds call !!! Maybe that's why I have been avoiding her calls.

she called me just to give her journal to her friend .. And in the end she specifically told me she called just for that...  I don't know what happened next she hung up and I started crying and I still am... It was 12:05 am (13.06.2019)

I just want to die now . I want someone to listen to me . Am I just meant for having all such pain, stress ,anxiety , headaches .

I want someone's shoulder to cry on and tell about this pain but I don't have anyone by my side ..

It was pneumonia that killed her.

I‚Äôm 90% sure.

Anyways, I‚Äôm writing this on my iPad which has the fuckin‚Äô weirdest keyboard layout in the world. My fingers are too short to type comfortably.

Who cares. I haven‚Äôt used this iPad in ages, don‚Äôt know why. Guess I just forgot about it. I spent 270 bucks on it, don‚Äôt know how I really forgot I had it.

I opened reddit and it was on my old account. The old account where I posted naively about self harm, even started making diary entries for a handful of days.

I cut myself for the first time on Oct. 23, 2018.

I read through the texts from the last year with mom. The last year of her life anyways. She told me that she was in the hospital with pneumonia on my birthday. I guess that‚Äôs what killed her. I realized I didn‚Äôt know shit about pneumonia so I googled it a bit.

I miss her SO much.

...

I am almost all packed for church camp. It‚Äôs not until the 26th, but I‚Äôm already prepared. I need to order some shorts though. I‚Äôve only got the one pair that are long enough to cover my legs. But I got these pajama pants today. They are light and airy. Blue with dark blue textured polka dots everywhere. I don‚Äôt have a good shirt. I want to get an really large T-shirt.

I feel so full. I drank 10 cups of water today. Not to mention too much food. I want to lose weight, but I felt pretty today, even with the weight. I felt like myself. My hair was wavy today, I slept in braids last night. I feel beautiful with wavy hair.

It‚Äôs raining out, and when I heard it I laughed. The local NPR station said there would be a change for thunderstorms and I almost said yeah right out loud.

I‚Äôm just tired. I want to wake up early tomorrow and get started with my day early.

The last few days been uplifting. I been getting compliments from various people saying that i am a hardworker and excellent guy. It was nice to hear. So i am appreciated. I am used to thinking i wasn't a good enough worker.

school been tough on me. I had more assignments to do including an essay in both classes. The last essay i turned in on sunday earned a B. the instructor commented that it was a fairly strong essay but forgot to use the times new roman font.  I felt good for that. i spent the whole weeking stressing on it because i wanted it to be perfect. I haven't started homework this week in both classes yet. I want to wait til friday to get it done since i have the whole day off from both jobs.

I want to look up ways to clean my body and organize my thoughts. i keep saying i am going to do it. I never follow through on it. cleaning my body, organize thoughts and improve my executive function. Those are the 3 things to improve.

as for my savings, i had to withdraw from it to pay my phone bill. I took more out to get fast food. I am doing it all fucking wrong. I was so good at savings until i bought that fucking fridge. I never got back on top.

How do i boost confidence? what does it feel to be confident? I never felt it my entire life. I am so used to being the timid quiet person. I never been a lion. always the lamb.

I can never have a platonic relationship with guys. Not without developing feelings or being attracted to them out of pure lust. I partially realized this. It is not fully confirmed until validated out loud.  I am lonely and i keep seeing friendship with males turning romantic. in reality its never going to happen and if i tried to anything sexual or even hint, chances are I can get my ass kicked and feelings hurt.  I repress those feelings and the insecurity comes out and i have thoughts of hating them and blocking them on all social media. Yesterday was my coworker's 21st birthday and i saw that he had over 400 comments saying happy birthday and so many people calling him. He even mentioned getting promoted at the grocery job and i wish him happy birthday and congratulations. deep down i felt jealousy. He worked at the grocery job less than 6 months and he gotten promoted quickly and gets compliments from customers on a daily basis. Hell a customer bought him lunch one day and i was so surprised. I want to be happy for him but i can't. I just think why can't it be me?? i should've been me. damn man.

In 10 minutes i will be punching in to work.
Thanks."
0,"11.06.19. My giraffe
I have this stuffed giraffe.

It‚Äôs soft and it‚Äôs cuddly and it has a cute little smile and four limbs positioned perpetually open for a hug.

And it‚Äôs just the right size for them, too.

I keep it in my room, and whenever I‚Äôm alone I carry it around with me. I sleep with it every night.

I got it last year, during my first summer home from school.

My first summer dealing with flashbacks.

And nightmares.

And panic attacks.

And everything else that happened last summer.

There‚Äôs this pile of stuffed toys in my room that the kids like to play with.

One day, I was sitting next to it.

And I thought: *I really need a hug.*

But there was no one around to ask for one.

I remembered being in the hospital after I tried to kill myself when I was a kid.

One of the doctors told my parents that I needed a hug.

So they went down to the gift shop and got me a little blue bunny, for baby boys.

(They were probably out of pink ones.)

And my parents gave it to me, so I would have something to hug.

I still have it. I bet it was somewhere in the pile.

But the bunny was for newborns - way too small for proper hugs.

And for whatever reason, hugging the bunny doesn‚Äôt make me feel better, even though it‚Äôs supposed to.

But I figured, maybe the doctor was onto something.

So I grabbed a different toy from the pile and wrapped myself around it and squeezed it tight.

It was the giraffe.

That giraffe was there to help me sleep when the dog or cat couldn‚Äôt stay in my room.

It was there when I needed something to hold onto because it felt like I was drifting away.

It was there through every panic attack, even the ones that lasted long into the night.

It was there every time I needed someone to stay with me while I cried. Or just to stay with me.

It was there every time I needed a hug.

No matter how many times.

The giraffe doesn‚Äôt care.

It‚Äôs just a toy.

It will be always be there for me.

No matter how big or small my worries are.

No matter what I‚Äôm feeling, or how long it lasts.

My giraffe just keeps being there.

When that summer ended, I brought the giraffe back to school with me.

And that stupid toy saw me through the rest of the worst year of my life.

After St. Patty‚Äôs, I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

My whole world had been turned upside down.

Everything felt so messed up, I couldn‚Äôt see how anything could ever be right again.

And I just wanted someone to give me a hug and tell me that everything was gonna be ok, so certain that they could believe it for me, because I still couldn‚Äôt.

My housemate got raped too, not long after me.

Her brother let her come over every single day for months so she could sit on his bed and cry and tell him everything while he listened.

Her sister helped her with her schoolwork when she started getting overwhelmed- even wrote an essay for her a couple times when she was in a pinch.

Her mom stayed up on the phone with her all night when she had so much anxiety that she was up until 4am puking in the bathroom.

She only went to counselling once.

She said: ‚ÄúWhy would I want to talk to a stranger? I‚Äôll just call my brother.‚Äù

That was all she needed.

Whenever I needed comfort, my giraffe was the only thing I knew would be there to give it to me.

Without hurting me.

Without taking advantage of me.

Without wanting anything in return.

My giraffe is always there to give me a hug.

It stays with me for as long as I want.

It would even listen to me, if I wanted to talk to it.

(I don‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs listening in spirit as I think things through in my head. It‚Äôs even sitting on my lap right now as I type this.)

It never judges me.

And sometimes, when things get really hopeless, I hold it up so I can look into its big, round eyes.

And its warm smile.

Its arms open for a hug.

And I imagine it saying: *Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.*

And then I pull it in close and squeeze.

All I ever wanted was a hug.

There‚Äôs a person-sized hole in my heart.

My giraffe isn‚Äôt it enough to fill it completely, but it takes up a little space.

Now, the hole‚Äôs that much smaller.

I know it‚Äôs stupid to love a stuffed toy.

...I‚Äôm nineteen years old, for fuck‚Äôs sake!

But it helps."

I jokingly posted on my story that my new aesthetic is crying on the bathroom floor while listening to music.

Which was meant to look like a joke, but it really isn‚Äôt. Although I wasn‚Äôt crying, I did feel empty inside.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about where my life would be right now if everything didn‚Äôt happen the way it did.

Would I still be mad at my mom all the time, or would I finally matured enough to stop listening to my dad and love her.

Would I still be as into art as I have? F and the arts provided a safe space for me this year and I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd be AS involved if I hadn‚Äôt needed it so badly.

Or maybe I‚Äôd be even more confident of a person. A better leader, a better friend, a stronger person.

But my life isn‚Äôt that way entirely.

I‚Äôm thankful for the pain in a way. I needed it. I deserved it. I would be nobody without it. Not to say my pain defines me, it just has played a huge part in who I am this year.

...

Milla and I texted a lot Saturday night. We‚Äôve talked before about wanting to lose weight. She‚Äôs not fat by any means at all, but she‚Äôs not a model either.

I‚Äôm a lot bigger than her. I don‚Äôt want to be.

My fat thumbs mock me as I type.

We made a pact for the summer. We would both ‚Äúglo‚Äù up. We both want to lose like 30 pounds.

We almost hung out today, but Jesus I have so much social anxiety. I cancelled because I was going to my grandmas.

She was gonna come over and we would go for a walk around the neighborhood. I told her I finally found F‚Äôs moms house after years of her living so close.

I walked by her house yesterday. The garage door was open but it shut when I approached.

I keep hoping that one of the times I walk by, F‚Äôs car would be in the driveway.

I don‚Äôt know why. Fuck. Why am I like this.

I‚Äôm not obsessive around him in person at ALL. Why is my head like this?!

If anything I‚Äôm extremely shy around him sometimes until I warm up a bit.

...

I showered and put some shit that‚Äôs supposed to make my hair curly in my hair. My sister told me it would totally work on flat hair. BS I thought. And I was right. My hair is as flat as a pancake.

I put on one of those sheet face masks my grandma bought for us. It was aloe. I sill have it on. My face is cold and goopy. Quiet music from grouper plays from my earbuds.

I‚Äôve been messing around with the weight loss app Milla and I downloaded. I ate a lot today. Thank GOD I skipped lunch. I still went way over my calorie goal.

I like the new app. ‚ÄúLifesum.‚Äù

It‚Äôs way more fun that my fitness pal.

I really really really don‚Äôt want to fuck it all up again. I NEED to lose weight.

I want to wear long flowey linen pants and lounge around in sandals.

I want to be able to find a bralette in my size, or be able to wear literally any article of women‚Äôs clothing from target or something.

I don‚Äôt want to be a clothing addict. I‚Äôm not. I just want to be comfortable. I‚Äôve been gravitating towards beiges lately.

I want to be the tall, skinny, red head me with wavy long hair and linen clothes and crazy earrings and freckles. And of course my glasses.

Not tall, fat, red head me with my blonde roots coming through. My hair as flat as paper. Bad posture, mismatching clothes, chubby cheeks with freckles. I don‚Äôt want to be that me anymore.

...

I always thought when people drew/painted pictures of lit windows at night, that they weren‚Äôt really yellow in person.

But as I look out of the window here in this strangely familiar bedroom, the window of a house across the way a bit is yellow.

A little yellow square casting yellow light onto the lawn/bushes.

I wish I lived here. I wish I could move in with my grandma full time.

I wouldn‚Äôt be a burden to her ever. I‚Äôd buy my own things and do my own laundry. Cook my own food and everything.

But I feel so grown up sleeping on this queen sized bed with soft covers. The only furniture in the room a couple dressers and a chair and a nightstand with a lamp and clock.

It‚Äôs a peaceful room. Meant for sleeping, and not much more. Truly a bedroom.

My bedroom at my house is a lot of shit crammed into one space. A bed, an art studio, a closet, everything.

But this change is nice.

...

I wish my grandparents would go to bed and turn the damn TV off. It‚Äôs almost 11 PM.

I want them to turn the light off so I can open the blinds and see out of the skylight in the living room."

I‚Äôm sitting by the open window, trying to let the fresh air cool me down and the sound of the rain relax me.

It‚Äôs not working.

I‚Äôve had a series of bad days.

I‚Äôve been really sick and tired, which hasn‚Äôt helped.

And my mind just will not stop running.

I bombed my math test.

I‚Äôm not even sure if I passed.

Will it ever get better?

I made myself food.

Drank water.

Didn‚Äôt have any coffee.

...Maybe that‚Äôs why.

Maybe I‚Äôm just chemically imbalanced.

I hope I get diagnosed with ADHD so they give me stimulants. I don‚Äôt care if the drugs are basically meth. I need dopamine.

I was about to break, and smoke before 5pm.

But then it started raining, so I figured I‚Äôd wait for it to stop.

I might not, though.

What‚Äôs the point?

Trying is really, really hard sometimes.

And I‚Äôm not even doing a good job.

I‚Äôm just a stupid, selfish fucking failure sitting around making excuses for myself while demanding the world gives me everything I want.

What do I even want?

I just want to be stable.

And maybe even happy, if I could manage it.

But I‚Äôm not sure if I can anymore.

I thought if I just kept trying, I would get better.

I didn‚Äôt do anything today.

I woke up. Went to church.

Had a mild crisis about my art.

Watched TV.

Had people over.

And came to bed.

I‚Äôm wasting my life. One day at a time.

And you know, I‚Äôm okay.

I know I‚Äôll never amount to anything big, it‚Äôs just not in my personality, but I‚Äôm okay with that.

My goal in life is just to connect with people. Not too many. But enough.

I want to be a recognized name amongst the art community in my city/medium. And that‚Äôs possible. I CAN do that. It‚Äôll take some work, but so does everything.

But even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be fine.

I don‚Äôt quite know why I want what I want. I just need someone I look up to to be proud of me and my work.

Right now. That‚Äôs F.

But I don‚Äôt think of him that much. Not during my summer break anyways.

But I don‚Äôt have that pressure on me every day. To make something creative, beautiful, original, innovative. And that really takes a toll on me.

I need time to cultivate and present a beautiful body of work. And that‚Äôs what summer is for me. Well‚Äî what it was supposed to be.

I can‚Äôt let it slip away from me again. I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.

I need a 20 piece portfolio by December. That‚Äôs a LOT. I can do it, I just need a vision.

I need to visualize the whole of my portfolio in my head. Not piece by piece exactly, because that has never worked for me. I just need need to take baby steps.

I need 12 for a concentration.

Another 5-8 to show my full array of skills.

Tomorrow I‚Äôm staying at my grandmas again. Which means I probably won‚Äôt have time to eat a whole lot done. But sometimes I need that inspiration from every day life.

I want to make heavily detailed, rich prints, full of deep, dark colors. Blood red. Ocean blue.

Yet I also want to make beautifully light prints. Yellows with dainty black drawings. Precise marks. Pinks and grays.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll make my portfolio about.

My moods and emotions. My typical headspace.

But how unoriginal.

I don‚Äôt want to be innovative. I want to hit people in the heart. But not too hard. My parents see everything.

If only I had total and complete freedom. To depict whatever I please. I‚Äôd truly be free.

I could never bring my church friends to my art shows if I was totally true to the darkest parts of myself.

But that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll figure it out. I‚Äôm too shy to talk/show people deep shit anyways.

I just need to make one piece, and hopefully it will guide the rest.

I pray to the gods of art and fear.

I really want to do something with blood. But that‚Äôs fucked up. I have this vague image of a fruit bleeding in my head. I haven‚Äôt been able to shake it for days.

I‚Äôve refused to dive into the idea because it would be inconceivable to make. Right?

I‚Äôd need to come up with some good explanation for it. But that always comes later.

Making art is hard.

I‚Äôm gonna finish my podcast and sleep on it."

I can‚Äôt help but wonder what it all means.

My life. My art.

I dream to one day be inseparable. But that means being vulnerable in front of the world.

I‚Äôve got a whole portfolio in my head. I can imagine my work in galleries. I can imagine it being photographed just the right way. On a beautiful white wall.

I can imagine how it makes you feel. Me feel.

Yet I don‚Äôt make much.

Because the work in my head is real to me. More real to me than any drawing I‚Äôve ever made, any photo, any print I‚Äôve ever produced.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I feel so real, but feel so fake when asked to prove myself to people.

F sent the group chat a message about national art competitions for high schoolers. One in particular he pointed out. I took a look at it, and after a while started realizing that I‚Äôll never be a good artist. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have the skills, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt have any good subject matter.

I‚Äôm not political. I don‚Äôt have interesting heritage to make art about. I have nothing but myself. And my feelings. A whole plethora of them.

Music evokes feeling. So does dance. Film, and very rarely art.

Art is eye candy. Rarely soul candy.

...

It‚Äôs hot out here. My eyes squint and strain to see the keyboard on my phone. But the breeze is cool. It feels like summer.

The ocean of leaves rustling and the wind catches my hair just right.

This is what I love about life. The beautiful world we have. The sun on my skin. Soft linen shirts. Toes curled. A crystal lite pink lemonade.

I could make art about nature‚Äî man had been doing that for thousands of years. But I can‚Äôt make any contemporary art about the natural world without it being seen as ‚Äî god I don‚Äôt know, all that environmentalist shit.

Which I‚Äôm not opposed to at all.

I just believe this world won‚Äôt be around for much longer. There‚Äôs nothing I can ever do. And even if I devoted my whole life to it, in the end I‚Äôd barely make a dent.

But I can capture its beauty with the small things. Ugh. I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve just got so much emotion I want to put into art. Terrible pain and extreme serenity. The whole spectrum.

Some people make controversial art. I don‚Äôt.

And that‚Äôs okay. If I never make it big in the spotlight, because there will always be people out there like me who can appreciate it.

The quiet and lonely parts of life.

That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôll make art about loneliness. Maybe.

I can‚Äôt pick a whole theme for my life. My life changes. But I can decide on the next few pieces.

I won‚Äôt do that now.

I just want to lay here. Listen to the music. The birds chirping. Enjoying the last ‚Äúfree‚Äù summer of my life. The last summer without a gazillion responsibilities.

I love and hate growing up."

0,"09.06.19. The bad days
Sometimes, I have really bad days.

And everything feels like too much.

...But at the same time it feels like nothing‚Äôs really wrong and I made it all up because I‚Äôm too emotional.

And it feels like it‚Äôs never gonna get better.

...Because how can it get better if nothing‚Äôs even wrong in the first place and it‚Äôs all in my head?

And I feel completely alone.

I feel like no one can help me.

...Because how can they, if nothing‚Äôs even wrong?

But then I remember that I don‚Äôt need their help.

When I want something from others, I have to remember to just give it to myself instead.

That‚Äôs what healthy people do.

And I am not healthy.

I‚Äôm insecure.

And mentally ill, most likely. (I‚Äôll find out on Friday.)

So when I want someone to be here with me, to listen to me and tell me they‚Äôre sorry that all this is happening to me (if it even is. What if I just made it up?) and give me a hug and tell me that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok, I should just do all that to myself instead.

So I keep telling myself: *Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.*

And I just have to try my best to believe it.

When I want comfort, I have to give it to myself.

Because I can‚Äôt just keep lying in bed all day.

I have a math test, for fuck‚Äôs sake.

So I come up with a plan.

I have to be gentle with myself.

That‚Äôs what the internet said to do.

I can listen to myself wallow for one hour.

Then, I have to get up.

I set a timer.

Maybe then I‚Äôll take some Advil.

And go outside for a walk.

I probably should, since I‚Äôve just been lying in bed. It‚Äôll be good to stretch my legs.

It‚Äôs nice out today. Maybe the warmth and the sunshine will help me.

I can walk to the corner store and get some coffee.

Coffee always helps.

Plus, I need it to focus.

How can I do math without coffee?

When I get back, I‚Äôll study for as long as I can.

And I‚Äôll try to remember to eat and stay hydrated.

And if I do a good job, I can go to the dispensary downtown and buy some fancy weed. Something that will put me to sleep right away.

And after 5pm, I can smoke it.

Then hopefully I can go to bed early, unless my housemate gets mad that I don‚Äôt want to watch TV with him. I already skipped our usual show yesterday.

But watching TV with him isn‚Äôt bad.

I‚Äôll probably have fun.

And then tomorrow I‚Äôll write my math test.

And everything will be ok.

It just sucks right now.

But it won‚Äôt be like this forever, even if I really feel like it will.

Just because something looks like the end, that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt more I just can‚Äôt see yet.

That‚Äôs what my tattoo is there to remind me for.

It‚Äôs always there, even when I forget.

I just have to get through the bad days.

Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok."

Maybe things HAVE progressed. Just a bit. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in serious grief anymore, right?

What I‚Äôm dealing with isn‚Äôt just grief, it‚Äôs a lot of other shit all burritoed together.

I woke up, and it was so hard to get out of bed. I‚Äôm so sick of being awake. I hate myself so fucking much for not being productive this week. Next week will be like the first week of summer break. I‚Äôm going to get up early, shower, make myself a healthy breakfast, listen to podcasts/music, and work on stuff.

I just have to overcome this brain fog myself. I am in control of myself.

I have something to look forward to at least. I have something to practice for. I‚Äôve got art camp. I‚Äôm so SOOOO excited. I am not going to let myself be depressed for this. I still can NOT believe I‚Äôm truly going. I think my first diary entry was the day I found out I didn‚Äôt get a scholarship to the camp. I was devastated. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go.

But it fucking worked out. It always works out. And I need to remember that about the Santa Fe trip. Things might not look good now, but it‚Äôll happen/OR something better will happen. I‚Äôve been very lucky through life.

Except for mom.

But my life had been going almost too good up until that point. I remember on New Year‚Äôs Day of 2018 thinking that something bad was going to happen this year. Something devastating. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve got some psychic intuition, but I was right.

Jesus Christ. I was right. I was hurting so much last year, nothing at all compared to this year. Maybe that scare with F seeing my SH, but that pales with comparison to crying myself to sleep every night and waking up still crying.

One year ago today, I still went to work after mom died. I didn‚Äôt want to stay home, I mean, I did, but I didn‚Äôt want my dad to sit down and talk to us. I just needed to be somewhere else. Work for me is like a totally different life. I can shut off my emotions, what‚Äôs happening in my personal life, and just be a charismatic robot who takes food orders.

I don‚Äôt even think I cried that day. I wanted to cry. I wanted someone to ask me what was wrong. No one ever did. No one at work knows my mom died. Even though I was working there when it happened. No one knows. The only person who remembered my mom was Marilyn, but she quit.

And I‚Äôm okay with that. But it sucks. I want to tell people my mom died. But Jesus Christ what a conversation bomb. I can‚Äôt even bring it up when people ask me what‚Äôs wrong. I don‚Äôt want to make people deal with that.

I miss her, but I‚Äôve learned to block it out. I had to make a decision; live every day in grief but remember mom, or forget and move on with my happy life. It really hurts a lot.

I just want to hold her again. Look her in the eyes. Hear her voice. I can barely remember it. I wish I could see a video of her. I wish I had her fucking phone.

When Grammy dies, I want moms phone. I hope they didn‚Äôt get rid of it. And I want her ashes. I never have seen them. I never got to hold her.

Fuck them. They‚Äôre rich as shit. They could afford a casket. They could afford a fucking tombstone. But they didn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôll never know why.

I‚Äôm just so fucking sad and mad I‚Äôll never be able to visit her grave. Because she DOESNT FUCKING HAVE ONE. SHELL JUST BE ANOTHER FUCKING VASE IN THE HOUSE. JESUS CHRIST WHAT A TWISTED WORLD.

I miss her so much

More than I can say

Fuck.

Anyways. Work was ok. It was fun. My legs hurt a lot.

I want to die

I hate missing her so much"

Ahhh..  This migraine

While writing this I m having difficulty in concentrating on everything .

Yesterday, I went to hospital but came back in back home in the afternoon with my cousin when it was boiling hot outside...

I came home had a lunch and I passed out
I was sleeping for like 15 hours OMG..

And having some weird dreams about my problem related to someone who created it all...

My friend came from his hometown back to K-town yesterday he even called and texted me but unfortunately I was passes out ..

Will call him today definitely."

One of my favourite feelings is coming through the door when I‚Äôm the last one home and putting my key on the key holder next to all the others.

Then mine‚Äôs the fourth, and the set is complete.

Everything is in its place.

...Including me.

And I always smile to myself as I go upstairs.

Today, I was the last one home.

I put my key next to all the others.

But mine was only the third.

One of my housemates went away, indefinitely.

She got hurt pretty bad.

We don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs gonna be until she gets better and comes back.

Not everything is in its place.

Remember when I used to only post once a day?

I even told myself I would never post more than once.

That I should never need to use this as an outlet more than once a day.
That I should get out of my head and off the internet and live in the real world.

Lol!

Fuck that.

Today, I totally backslid.

I didn‚Äôt study *at all* even though I really needed to.

I spent most of the day lying in bed overthinking.

I even went on an online counselling service. I haven‚Äôt done that in months, since when I was really bad.

Although- I did end up going to Tim Horton‚Äôs with a friend. So at least I didn‚Äôt completely regress.

But I spent a lot of today dealing with all my crazy emotions.

Fuck.

Why am I so emotional?

Maybe it‚Äôs just PMS.

...That‚Äôs probably what it is.

But if it‚Äôs just my period, is any of this even real?

Fuuuck.

I wish I didn‚Äôt get PMS. How am I supposed to know if my feelings are real or if they‚Äôre just hormones making me crazy?

Every time I get PMS, it makes me question if I should even be feeling bad about any of the stuff that makes me feel bad.

Like, do I even feel bad about that stuff when I‚Äôm not on my period??

(The answer is obviously yes. I feel bad all the time. I‚Äôm all over the place.)

But since it gets worse when I‚Äôm on my period, it makes me feel like I just made everything up because I‚Äôm too hormonal.

Oh my god, I have so many fucking feelings today.

*Fuck* feelings.

Why can‚Äôt I be a computer?

Or a boy.

Boys don‚Äôt get periods!

...Or raped.

Well, that‚Äôs not true. Boys get raped.

But they get raped a lot less than girls.

If I was a boy, maybe I would be less afraid. Boys are less afraid of that stuff than girls. And they don‚Äôt get hit on as much, either!

Fuck boys.

Boys are stupid.

So are periods.

There‚Äôs been a lot of construction happening outside my house lately.

I don‚Äôt remember when it started.

It‚Äôs all background noise- I didn‚Äôt even pay attention to it.

They start working before I wake up, and they keep going long into the night. It‚Äôs just a part of my life.

Then today, all of a sudden, it stopped.

I‚Äôm not sure why.

It was only for a minute.

Something must have broken.

But for a minute of that one Saturday afternoon, everything stopped.

All the beeping.

All the engines growling.

All the thumping and the buzzing and the grinding and the sawing.

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it was there until it stopped.

And then the whole world was quiet.

And I felt some of the tension melt away.

And I realized all that noise was giving me a headache.

And it felt really nice to have some quiet.

Then it turned back on again.

When the construction started up again, I finally realized how loud it was.

And I hated how much harder it was to focus.

And I hated how it never stopped.

And I *hated* all the noise.

And even though I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it before, now I wanted it gone more than anything.

Then my ears got used to the sound, and it faded back into the background again.

But now, every time something beeps, I remember how nice the quiet was for a minute.

It reminds me of my feelings.

For a minute, once, my brain got quiet.

All the mental illness went away.

I just... existed. No extra noise.

Then it turned back on again."

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt feel better today.
I feel better. But it‚Äôs just this empty feeling I haven‚Äôt been able to shake all day.

Even at work. I just felt kind of numb.

I woke up late. I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I woke up and remembered the shitty 40 min conversation I had with fuckin‚Äô Denise from the suicide hotline chat.

Jesus. She told me the same thing everyone tells me. You should talk to F. You should reach out, get help.

And I almost believed I would, that I really could.

But like I said, I felt better today. Which isn‚Äôt totally unusual. I‚Äôll go back to feeling better, maybe even happy this next week, and something will happen and I‚Äôll just spiral out of control back to the fucked up part of my head that just wants to watch me suffer and pay for the shit I do.

I‚Äôm sick of the cycle. And I‚Äôm just numb from it all.

I wanted to feel SOMETHING, god, just anything. And I really wanted to cut. It just wouldn‚Äôt be satisfying. My left thigh has no space left. My right either. I need to let them heal for a few weeks before camp.

But I still wanted to be in that headspace. I decided to draw what was going through my head. I‚Äôm embarrassed honestly. I drew what looks like some edgy tumblr post that kid used to show me on the bus back in middle school.

Jesus Christ, I used to make fun of her. She was trying to reach out to me for help, and I just thought she was attention seeking.

I made the mistake of drawing in my new sketchbook. It was so satisfying. But I realized I‚Äôm fucked because I was going to fill the entire journal with life drawing and just turn that in as my summer work instead of 10 drawings.

I taped over it with paper.
[https://prnt.sc/nz48t0](https://prnt.sc/nz48t0)
[https://prnt.sc/nz48z7](https://prnt.sc/nz48z7)

I‚Äôll draw over it and it‚Äôll look like nothing interesting is there. I really just do that so if some random person asks to see my sketchbook, they won‚Äôt have the audacity to remove the tape and look underneath it in front of me.

But if I never end up being able to talk to F, I secretly hope when I turn in the entire sketchbook when school gets back, that he‚Äôll look under the paper.

Look at the fucking desperate things I do for attention. Jesus.

Today was boring as hell. I spent a few hours making intricate packing lists for both camps.
I need to order more clothes and some random shit like an umbrella, and a hairbrush. I‚Äôve seemed to have lost my hairbrush somehow.

Cue ‚ÄúOh where is my hairbrush.‚Äù

So I am just going to post my ranting and complaining about my situationship and my asshole boyfriend.

It's supposed to be a relationship but it honestly feels more like roommates. He is a very unemotional person so its hard to get much out of him.

I don't want flowers or presents everyday. I just want him to listen to me. Actually listen and not get offended or totally zone out. Complimenting me would also be great too. But I guess I can't ask for too much. Or anything.

We've been together for almost 6 years and have an almost 5 year old.

So yeah I got pregnant 3 months into it.

He has talked to other girls, gone on fetish sites to post his dick pics and complain about me. The list goes on.

I know I know I should not be with him. Especially not raise my daughter to think it's okay. I just for some stupid reason. Love him. He is my comfort zone.

Maybe that's what it is.

He was with me the whole pregnancy. He was with me when I had preeclampsia. He was with me when the headaches started. He was with me when I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

I feel like that's what he's still here though.

He doesn't want to be the jerk that breaks up with his daughter's mother who has MS and kick her out of the house.

Today, i find myself thinking alot about my relationship. Im so used to constant contact, instant replying and i dont have that with this one. I went from ""The Best"" to nothing within three weeks, I say i love you and its pushed to the side. I feel like all my effort, all my emotion is being drained into a blackhole. All i want is you and you know this, I came to you with a shattered heart and i glued it together to give you a chance. I take one step and if its wrong, I get repercussions. But if you were to take that step, I would hold it back. I am nothing, Im just trash that one person picks up and puts into anothers container. I want to know why. Why am i suffering. I took 7 months of having my love one-sided and your doing it to me now. Love works, Love doesn't work. Does it matter? Your the most beautiful in the world while i sit here and cry for the attention... A person will love you, A person has limits. A person will show you the day, the day of the most love. and you will push that to the side and that day will be the last day, You will be loved. Suffering till the end, No help, No care.

Today started off shitty.

But then I met a cat.

3 cats, actually.

I was walking past when I heard meowing.

And I looked over, and there were a bunch of cats looking back.

For a moment, we all just stared at each other.

Then I said: ‚ÄúHi babies!‚Äù and clicked my tongue.

And they ran right over!

And all of a sudden I had two cats (the third hung back to watch) rubbing themselves all over me, meowing and batting at my hand to pet them.

I don‚Äôt know exactly how long I stayed there for.

Honestly, I think it was at least an hour.

But it was a beautiful, sunny day to sit outside with my new friends.

They were so soft!

And SO cute and friendly!!

I played with them and petted them like I was in some kind of trance. No other thoughts even crossed my mind. I was totally focused on them.

I probably looked like a lunatic, giggling with a bunch of stray cats. I even talked to them!

(I always talk to animals like they‚Äôre people. Especially cats. On some level, I think they understand. Or at least they appreciate that I respect them enough to treat them like an equal. Lol!)

I hung out with the cats until they stopped coming back to me for more.

Then we gave each other one last look, and went our separate ways.

This isn‚Äôt even a diary anymore.
Just my rants to the void.
And sometimes, someone will read them.

But I guess I should at least explain today, I‚Äôd been looking forward to it all week right?

I woke up and this overwhelming feeling loomed over me. I wake up with extreme anxiety. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt remember what happened last night. I‚Äôm trying to remember what I need to do today, and tomorrow.

I‚Äôm just grasping for anything. It‚Äôs all so overwhelming. And then I remember something that happened last night, and one by one, one thing leading to the next. I get a grip on things.

That is, only if I have something I have to do.

And I remembered today was Thursday. I remembered I was going to school to work and see F today. Then I remembered he hadn‚Äôt let me know if he was going to be there or not. I thought about texting him again, I almost did. And then I worried over it for hours. Since 6:40 AM.

Until 10:15ish. He messaged me and said he was at school. He said I could come.

‚ÄúHey ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. I am here. I don‚Äôt need any assistance but if you want to come up and work you can.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt need any assistance. OK?

I got my shit together and dad drove me to the back of the school. F let me in the doors.

And it was so weird. It was like greeting an old friend, but you pretend like nothings changed, although you can‚Äôt quite remember what things used to be like. He asked how my summer was going. I just said ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Which if I‚Äôll be honest, wasn‚Äôt a total lie up until this week. I was so fucking awkward. I‚Äôm so fucking STUPID. I put these fucking walls up, and then people don‚Äôt want to talk to me. God‚Äî I wish I weren‚Äôt like that. I wish I could just be HONEST.

I set my bag on the table and I kind of explained the art stuff I got. And he disappeared into the changing room. I worked alone for most of the time. For at least an hour or two.

The plate etching worked perfectly. I‚Äôve got it figured out. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt decide what to do because I thought I was done because I left one supply I needed at home. I went into the changing room to show him the outcome.

I said I‚Äôd finally be able to do real ones instead of these fucking doodles. He came out of the room and we talked for a minute. He asked if I was doing another one or gonna do anything else. I said I was, but I‚Äôd left it at home. Then I texted my dad to go to my room and find the supply I left and bring it to me.

I sat around waiting for him to bring it. He asked if I‚Äôd heard from/hung out with anyone else from the class. I said I‚Äôd stopped by Milla‚Äôs house briefly, and texted Lilah a bit, but that was about it. He asked when my art camp was again. We talked about the giant cyanotype he had made. It was HUGE.

And then he went back into his little room. I went outside to get the stuff from my dad. I realized I forgot to put a stop in the door and I got locked out for a second. But F let me back in.

It‚Äôs so strange. How I idolize him, yet in person, I‚Äôm fucking shy and get mad at him and he just disappears. He always just disappears into that room.

Finally he came out and started working on his computer while playing some history podcast he was listening to. We talked about podcasts briefly. He said he listened to HBM, the one I love and thought he would like.

He said he didn‚Äôt really like it.

He didn‚Äôt like it.

God. How could I be so fucking stupid?????

He asked me if I‚Äôd read any of Art & Fear. I said I‚Äôm on my second reading of it. I told him how I‚Äôd bought the author‚Äôs other, similar book. I told him I‚Äôd lend it to him when I was done.

Anyways. Things got less awkward, but no less than I usually am.

I don‚Äôt know why I idolize him.

I know why I did.

I don‚Äôt know why I still do.

I‚Äôm realizing things are never going to be the same. They might be better, or worse. I just don‚Äôt know.

And he talked more about the Santa Fe trip. He said we can make it an official school trip. But he said the only issue is that he and his wife would have to go for free. Which I don‚Äôt blame him. Either we‚Äôd have to raise almost 2k. OR we‚Äôd have to collectively pay for them.

There is NO WAY we can raise 2k.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve lost interest in everything. I need to focus on ME this summer. I can‚Äôt afford to waste time doing some fundraiser.

I‚Äôd rather just pay extra for them.

I should have said I‚Äôd taken more hours on to pay for the Santa Fe trip when he asked me about work and shit.

FUCK.

UGHHHH!

I finished up. Said thanks. Etc.

And I went home. Baked my plates in the oven for a while. Then let them dry.

I messaged F once more. I thanked him for letting come by and work.

He said, ‚ÄúOf course. You‚Äôre welcome. Let me know whenever you want to come up and work. I‚Äôm happy to have you around if I‚Äôm going to be there. Happy etching!! I‚Äôm anxious to see a plate FOR REAL.‚Äù

I know he‚Äôs serious, and being sarcastic, but I can‚Äôt help but worry if he‚Äôs sick of me doing all these fucking tests. I don‚Äôt want to let him down. I want to make a good plate.

But every idea I can think of is so vile.

But he said he‚Äôs happy to have me around. Or was he being passive, or did he sincerely mean it. Fuck.

I had a mental breakdown this afternoon. Finished season 5 of black mirror. I really don‚Äôt like this season AT ALL. The stories are interesting, but the endings don‚Äôt feel like black mirror.

I just lost it. I wrote a diary entry that sounded like a fucking mental person wrote it.

I still am depressed AF right now. I just want to stay in bed for the rest of my life.

I wish I weren‚Äôt like this.

Why can‚Äôt I be happy?"

Added some fuckin format

I wish these entries were personal.
```
Every fucking day
I go out
And do things
And see people
And talk to them
All fake

All so FUCKING shallow
Every interaction is selfish
Even my own
There‚Äôs not a person on Earth with exception.
Not even fucking F.

And I‚Äôm SO happy with them.
And that‚Äôs not a lie.
I LOVE fucking being the outside
Person I am
That person is shallow
Fucking people pleaser
Desperate for attention
Good or bad

Embarrassing or not
She fucking runs to it
And the SECOND
I‚Äôm alone.
The second I have to face
my true self
There is so much pain

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm drowning in a headache
Every thought
Everything I think
Turns into self hatred

And I hide it
From everyone. From my family. From those I actually care about. From even my outer self.
I‚Äôm here rotting
And NO ONES GOT A FUCKING CLUE

I could ask for help
Not that anyone in the world could truly help me
I‚Äôm the only one that can help me
But I fucking hate myself
And even if they knew
Would they really care
I mean REALLY

Or would they be sad for a while
Even feel sympathy
‚Äî FUCK
everything is pointless
The only think that makes sense in my head is ME = BAD
Therefore
PUNISH ME

AND No one and their fucking bullshit wisdom can help me. Because I‚Äôll always be like this.
When is IT FUCKING GONNA END.

Because it won‚Äôt end when I speak up. Maybe my outer self might feel a little better.

But ME. I‚Äôm damned.
What‚Äôll I do HUH?
Make it another year or two
While I get fucking worse and worse
If she makes it to art school
Can she rely on me for her fucking ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù

Because she‚Äôs got 3 weeks left
Until her freedom is gone
Her fucking freedom to make whatever the hell she wants
Whatever I want
But all I wanna depict
Is my bloody body
The earth, the trees screaming in agony
The lightning smiting the very earth that created it
Because it was born to hate
Fake fucking people
Self obsessed
My own corruption
On display for the fucking world

I want to photograph me
Not her
But photos show the physical world
I‚Äôm fucking here
Alone.

And I‚Äôll always and forever be alone.
Maybe she‚Äôll find her soulmate. The ‚Äúone.‚Äù
But when he‚Äôs gone. When she lies awake at night. She‚Äôll have to confront me

Because I‚Äôm fucking all I‚Äôve got right now.

I want to rip my body apart and die.

I won‚Äôt fuckin do it

But it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to

I wish someone would knock me out
I don‚Äôt want to be conscious right now

I feel like I‚Äôm losing it

0,"06.06.19. Arguments
I got in an argument with my mom today.

And with my housemates.

...And also with some friends.

I guess I was feeling a little argumentative.

My mom called me a stubborn brat who hates losing.

But I don‚Äôt argue to win.

I argue to lose.

I like hearing different opinions. I like having my perspective changed.

But the thing is, I‚Äôm not gonna let just anyone change my core beliefs.

If you‚Äôre gonna prove me wrong, you have to prove it.

And the only way to prove something is to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

You wouldn‚Äôt send a murderer to death row if you only *kind of* thought he really killed that guy.

So why would I let someone change my mind without looking for the flaws in what they‚Äôre saying?

If your opinion passed all my tests, I respect it.

But it has to pass *all* my tests.

I am always willing to change my mind.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean arguing with me is easy.

The problem is, some people take my questioning as a personal attack.

But it‚Äôs not *about* them.

It‚Äôs about the argument.

They don‚Äôt care.

They get angry.

They call me names.

They refuse to keep arguing with me.

...Which means I win.

But it doesn‚Äôt feel like winning.

And honestly, a lot of the times I wish they would just stay calm and prove me wrong.

It‚Äôs boring being right.

I want to have my mind blown with something I‚Äôve never thought of before.

I want to give an argument everything I can and still lose.

But usually things get too heated long before then.

So I don‚Äôt argue with people often.

But, to everyone who simply stops arguing with me because it bothers them that I don‚Äôt blindly accept their opinion.

To everyone who tells me that I‚Äôm pushy or conceited or obsessed with winning.

To everyone who stops listening when I stop agreeing with them.

I‚Äôm *right*.

And if you disagree, prove it.

I‚Äôm listening."

Sorry, this is the third post today.

I‚Äôm really trying
To not believe the lies

I catch myself just verbally abusing myself inside my head. Telling me my dad is mad at me, that he is disappointed. My friends all think I‚Äôm selfish and a crybaby. My dad thinks my friends are annoying. F thinks I‚Äôm annoying. Which he probably does right now. I‚Äôll never get printmaking figured out. My art is shallow. Nothing I make is any good. I bother F but never make anything good.

He was at school today and didn‚Äôt tell me.

He said he‚Äôd tell me.

But I FUCKED UP

And HAD TO FUCKING ASK HIM IF I COULD COME USE THE DAMN ETCHING SOLUTION in SUMMER.

He said sure, even when I doubted him. He made sure I realized I was more than welcome.

But I must‚Äôve done SOMETHING

GO FUCKING FIGURE. I am so annoying. Ali probably thinks I‚Äôm a clingy crybaby. So does P. And I‚Äôm trying to be patient with P because I know she‚Äôs got a lot going on right now, but sometimes I feel like she hates everyone and everything. Including me.

I don‚Äôt know if I should go to school tomorrow. Even if he says yes.

He said, ‚ÄúI think  I will be. I plan to get up there about 10 or so and stay for a while. I will let you know. ‚Äú

But ugh I hate texting because I can‚Äôt detect tone. He says he thinks he might be, thus implying that he had been considering not being there. Because he was already there today. And yet the next sentence he says he might go at about 10 and stay for a while. This implying yes.

But I feel like a fucking bother to him.
I probably am. Shit. Fuck.

Oh my god I can‚Äôt deal with another panic attack right now.

I just need someone to be nice to me.

Not just the sarcastic interactions.

I need a fucking human to just look me in the eyes and tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay.

What if he forgets about me tomorrow?

What if my dad doesn‚Äôt let me?? He already seems mad at me now. He didn‚Äôt say a peep the whole ride home with Alex.

I would be mad at me too. I‚Äôve been a shitty daughter who wants to fucking do art‚Äî of all professions.

But maybe I‚Äôm not cut out for it. I love doing it with all my heart, but I don‚Äôt even know how to love myself. I don‚Äôt know if I even can.

Maybe I need God.

But I really would rather have man.

Because man can look me in the eyes and tell me that I‚Äôm doing okay, even good.

Jeez, I ruin so many friendships when I open up.

Maybe I‚Äôm destined to be fake. But that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing. Faking happiness.

That‚Äôs not totally true. Some people do make me purely happy. I just don‚Äôt believe that I do them the same.

UGHHH I REALLY WISH THIS WASNT HAPPENING

I FUCKING HOPE F ISNT ANNOYED WITH ME

OR MY DAD

OR MY FRIENDS

I just wanna cry myself to sleep again.

But I don‚Äôt wanna wake up crying again.

I should just disappear."

It was so tiring day may be because I haven't slept for 20 hours but finally, the month of blessing has been ended ..

Last day before Eid I have been to my aunt's place because my uncle had minor heart attack that day and he has been in the hospital since then ...

After prayer we had breakfast then my other uncle came home.. I received many wishes from my friends and relative but idk may be I was waiting for someone special to wish even though I know she will not text ever ... While having these thoughts I slept and woke up by a call from my father it was 10 pm . It was routine call then I came to know that no one is in the house except for my one younger brother .. Everyone  went to aunts place but she was very upset ...

The whole last month I haven't studied .
I should study more often from now on ..
Got a video msg from my friend H who went to his hometown to celebrate Eid ..

I am not allowed to smoke until 5pm.

That‚Äôs how I make sure that I‚Äôm not slipping back into old habits.

If I smoke before 5pm, it means I have a problem.

Even if it‚Äôs 4pm.

Even if I‚Äôve done all my homework.

Even if I‚Äôm having a really hard day.

A really, really hard day.

I will not smoke until 5pm.

Even if there‚Äôs nothing else to do.

If I smoke before 5pm, then I‚Äôm throwing away all the kindness and privileges and second chances I‚Äôve been given to get back to where I am right now.

All the hard work I‚Äôve put into changing.

Any chance of having a bright future.

...If I even have a chance at a bright future.

Better not risk it.

Chances are slim enough as is.

I will not smoke before 5pm.

Even if I have a headache.

Even if I feel like crying.

Even if my head is spinning and my heart is racing and I can‚Äôt quite think straight.

Even if it‚Äôs all I want to do.

I am *not* allowed to smoke before 5pm.

Even if it‚Äôs 4:45pm.

Even if it‚Äôs 4:59pm.

If I let myself smoke before 5pm once, then I‚Äôll do it again. Then again, even earlier.

Then suddenly I‚Äôll be high for 3 days straight and failing out of school and unable to leave the house except to go buy more.

I already used my second chances.

Fuck it up again, and I‚Äôll have to deal with the consequences alone.

I am not allowed to smoke until 5pm.

I am not allowed to smoke until 5pm.

I finally got my art supplies in the mail.

I went to town on them right away. Tested out cleaning the plate with whiting, which worked great.

Then my dad left to get a haircut with my sister so I went and applied the ground to the plate like they did in the video. It went on smoothly and looked amazing!

However when I went to wash it off, it got all over my hands and would NOT come off. I started freaking out a bit.

Then I heard the garage door open and I went into panic mode and threw the cheap ikea coffee table I used as a surface into my room, and tried to hide the evidence.

My dad came in and was inspecting the mess I made at the sink and was yelling at me to clean it up. He went downstairs while I assured him I‚Äôd clean it all.

Although I had no fucking idea how to get it off. I looked online, tried some shit under the sink, and even emailed the company in a panic asking for help.

When cleaning at the sink, I felt a dull pain in the bottom of my stomach and got super light headed trying to clean. I started feeling weird, then everything was growing cold, and my eyesight was going dark so I fell back on the floor of the kitchen and laid there trying to get blood back to my head.

Until my sister came around the corner and I sprang up and went back to cleaning. I got up and laid on the couch blankly responding to her whining about her ruined haircut.

I realized I couldn‚Äôt fix this myself and I asked my dad to help. He was mad at first and banned me from using that stuff in the house again. I said okay. He helped me clean it up. He used gasoline to get it off. We went outside and I washed my hands with gas. My hands are pink.

While he was doing something in the garage, I snuck into his room to steal some more pain meds so I wouldn‚Äôt faint.

Note to self.

Don‚Äôt fucking cut yourself three nights in a row while ON YOUR PERIOD. Especially not on pain killers.

So I‚Äôve probably lost more blood than I should have. I‚Äôm fucked. I hope it comes back? I‚Äôve got no clue how blood works.

All I know is that I am never in a million years talking to my dad about my self harm.

That means never talking to anyone at school. Never talking to a therapist. Never talking to anyone. Ever. I probably shouldn‚Äôt write about it on my phone.

I probably shouldn‚Äôt go to the pool at camp this summer even in shorts.

I must be careful at camp because if any of my church friends find out, so will my dad.

I‚Äôm fucked.

Now I can‚Äôt get my plate ready to go etch at school tomorrow. I‚Äôm kind of done with printmaking.

I want to learn it SO BAD, but I just can‚Äôt do it myself. I need to learn.

I‚Äôm so fucked.

My leg hurts.

Why did I do this.

I need to shower and get the gasoline stench off me.

I ruined my brand new 15$ shirt.

I‚Äôm a fuck up.

I just messaged F asking if he would still be at school tomorrow. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to tell him.

I‚Äôll need to make a decision if I want to keep trying right now.

Tonight my mom died. A year ago.

I lived a year of my life without the person who brought me to life.

I‚Äôm mad I‚Äôm not more sad. Yet I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve healed a little.

There‚Äôs something wrong with me. For real. And I‚Äôm not just saying that lightly anymore. I‚Äôm mentally ill‚Äî

I obsess over my teacher for being nice to me.

I isolate myself from my real life friends and never tell them anything because I‚Äôm terrified I open up, that they‚Äôll avoid me.

I rely on total strangers on the internet to provide some social interaction. I then tell them more than they need to know, and I hurt others when I hurt myself.

I cut myself a bunch of times until there‚Äôs enough blood to run down the bath into the drain. Because I hate myself, and feel so alone.

I‚Äôm selfish. I lie. I manipulate people. I‚Äôm awful.
Fuck.

Oh my fucking god. I have 90% of the symptoms of BPD. My mom had BPD.

Fuckkkjj fuck fuck fuck I can‚Äôt be ill. I can‚Äôt be BPD. I am almost a textbook example according to this website. Although I‚Äôm not totally reckless. That‚Äôs the only thing. [http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/)

My dad thought my mom had BPD. He thought she was crazy.

I think I have BPD. If I‚Äôm still like this in a year or two. I‚Äôm going to talk to a therapist/psychologist.

Jesus Christ. I‚Äôm a monster. A disgusting outcast. Fuck me.

It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve looked at other disorders and conditions before but I never fully match. BPD is the first one that I understand and literally describes me.

I don‚Äôt wanna be medicated oh god fuck. But no one will ever know. I won‚Äôt tell a soul.

I‚Äôm not THAT bad.

I‚Äôm just clingy and hate myself at the base line.

Fuck....

I stared thinking about doing my diary entries manually in a journal or something irl, but it‚Äôs just so much easier to type. I hate handwriting.

After work I got home and checked discord. I hadn‚Äôt checked it since last night after bre left. I was joking about how much I hate myself, and I think she got mad. Which why the fuck did she get mad at ME for hating myself?

So when I got back on, I saw that they had muted me for an hour because I ‚Äúbroke the rules.‚Äù Which is stupid, because it wasn‚Äôt clear which rule I broke.‚Äù

I felt like shit regardless. Before work I got a letter from Grammy saying something about my mom. She attached a message my mom sent her a week before she died. The letter said something about how much my mom loved me and was so proud of me.

So I was crying in my room because I fucking missed my mom. I posted a picture of her on my close friends insta story. I kind of ranted about how unfair life is and how much I missed her.

Then after that was when I checked discord.

I needed to hurt myself. I needed to pay for what I did to Bre and I needed to get all this sadness and anger out over mom.

So I sat on the side of the tub and sliced my leg a bunch of times.

Not as much as I wish I would have.

I‚Äôll count here in a minute. 67.

I hate that these diary entries are so fucking sad and gross and I hate myself so much for it.

I want to die sometimes.

I deserve it more than anyone.

People will deny it. But no one knows who I am.

Nobody.

It‚Äôs June 4th.

But let‚Äôs talk about yesterday.

Woke up, got ready, threw some shit in a bag and my grandma picked my sister and I up.

We stopped at McDonalds and grabbed a breakfast sandwich. For some reason I‚Äôve eaten a ton of McDonald‚Äôs lately. I hardly EVER eat there.

We stayed at her house for a while and talked. We brainstormed what we might do with the day. After a lot of bad ideas, and stuff that we‚Äôve already done, my grandma suggested we just go out driving towards *art college.*

Obviously I was like, ‚ÄúHell yeah.‚Äù The last time I was there it was night and I could barely see.

So we drove down there with no instructions, taking the back roads, getting lost, missing exits. It was fun. Eventually we found it, and it was just as it‚Äôs always been. A cute little campus downtown.

And I am SO EXCITED to stay there for three weeks. I‚Äôm gonna have SO much fun. I hope I make some good friends.

Anyways, after we drove by it once or twice, we ended up near the art store in WP. We went in, the lady working there was really nice and told us about this weird paper that was hella expensive. She talked about workshops they did there, and said we should come.

I know of one of the artists who‚Äôs doing the next workshop there, well, he works at the store and I‚Äôm fairly certain he‚Äôs checked me out once or twice with my mom. He‚Äôs got cool art. I follow him on Insta.

I didn‚Äôt buy anything at that store because they are always out of shit. I love the place, because I‚Äôve just got so many fond memories going there, but it‚Äôs just always out of stock on popular stuff.

So we went to the other art store down in the CR. Which I fucking LOVE. They got a new door, which was a big improvement from the old one. They have so many cool knick nacks and shit and always are stocked in everything, even stuff you‚Äôve never dreamed you needed.

After like an hour of deciding, I finally picked out a sketchbook. Not to big, not too small, the paper wasn‚Äôt too white, it was ivory. The cover wasn‚Äôt black, it was brown. (Which was nice for a change.) There wasn‚Äôt too many sheets, and it wasn‚Äôt a spiral, which I was kind of nervous buying it because of that.

I got a couple of pens, and a pencil with RED LEAD. I knew they made red pencils, but not red lead for mechanical pencils!!

After that we dropped off the peppa pig scrunchie at Milla‚Äôs house, then went home, decided to skip lunch for then and just wait for dinner. I started drawing in my sketchbook when I got home. I drew the fireplace.[https://prnt.sc/nxiuih](https://prnt.sc/nxiuih)

My sister and grandma went off to some dumb ass store my sister wanted to go to, so I got some alone time to draw. I was really hungry by then.

When they got home, my grandma finished dinner and we all ate. I helped my sister make that banana pudding shit that is so good.

After dinner I was chilling in the living room being a sad shit thinking sad thoughts and being a bit of a bum. I didn‚Äôt want to cry in front of my family, so I went upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom. I talked to a friend, who probably saved me from going to town on my thighs with a pair of scissors I found. I owe her a lot. ;‚Äô-)

At about 8 I went downstairs for half an hour and ate some of that pudding we made. I got sad again and went to go back to hiding in the bathroom, I was more mad at my sister than sad.

I brought my sketchbook, and flipped to a new page and started drawing the window in the bathroom. All of those small lines and shit. I realized the plus side of having a moleskin sketchbook is that I can use both sides of the page without a big spiral in the middle.

I didn‚Äôt finish. I drew and listened to sad music over and over. Specifically one song I randomly happened upon earlier in the evening. Lighthouse by Grouper. I drew until about 10 and then got up and went back to bed.
[https://prnt.sc/nxizlm](https://prnt.sc/nxizlm)

And now it‚Äôs 9:59 in the morning and I should get ready.

OhH I forgot!

Whilst sitting on the floor of the bathroom crying like a loser, F messaged me on group me.

Anyways, back to today, I feel gross. My hair is greasy. My linen shirt is all wrinkled the wrong way. I probably smell. I didn‚Äôt bring my toothbrush‚Äî oh wait, my grandma has one for me.

Anyways. I have to work tonight. Only for a few hours. But in the meantime, I can spend the morning with my grandma. I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll do."

Fuck, I skipped another day.

But maybe I didn‚Äôt need to write, because I talked to multiple people yesterday who really knew me - as much as I‚Äôve been willing to share with people.

So I didn‚Äôt really have anything I needed to write about. I just talked to my friends.

Yesterday was the first day back at my 2nd job at the swimming pool. it was a few familiar faces and some new. i spent the whole time cleaning and throwing shit away because the pool place opens this way and everything has to look good. My depression was in full bloom so i felt like complete shit the whole time. I kept thinking to myself why am i here? i rather be somewhere dead. sorry to say that but its the truth. after work i grabbed lunch from a local family restaurant and went home to change for my nephew's 8th grade graduation. The program lasted an hour. I seen so many guys there dressed up. The urge to go up to a random guy and grab his ass was strong. I kept myself under control. after the program was done all the parents rushed out of there like it was no tomorrow. It was so many people all up on me and i was so overwhelmed by it.  i almost had a meltdown. now im home in bed late at night.  Today is my first back at the grocery store job. i will not be looking forward to seeing everyone. They are a bunch of lazy pig whores who never wants to work. All i need is a miracle to get away from the hellhole for good.

So far one of the tiring days in Ramadan . Its probably the last suhoor atm ...

Woke up at 9 am seriously disturbed by the construction work going on and only slept for 2 hours ..  Went to pensioners office with my grand mom but surprisingly they were out of cash due to last working day before vacation...

I have seen some really senior citizen there waiting for like 3 to 4 hours...

Then decided to buy those item that will not be available during Eid vacations ..

It was too hot out there today ... Then came back home and turned on my TV to watch world cup match .... And while thinking that how many relative and family friends will visit us this time ...

Then I don't know I slept there watching TV woke up at 5 prepared for iftaar and then enjoyed the last moments of the match ..

Most probably today will be the last day of Ramadan...."

It‚Äôs been about three months since I started logging entries into my diary here on Reddit.

That‚Äôs roughly 90-100 logs. All long, some short.

I should go back and read some of the ones from March. But I just remember them being depressing and so lonely.

I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve made progress. Not just in the past three months, but the last year.

Tomorrow night, one year ago, my mom died in her sleep. I still have no official cause of death. They didn‚Äôt say‚Äî probably something to do with her sickness.

But that‚Äôs the thing. She wasn‚Äôt sick, really. From what I was told, it was no more than usual. She‚Äôd always had SOMETHING going on. First it was the bipolar, the depression (which I wasn‚Äôt even aware of until shortly before her death.) the fibromyalgia, the diabetes.

But she was fine. She‚Äôd go to the hospital every blue moon for something or another. But she was fine. I think the diabetes even went away. And she didn‚Äôt seem too badly affected by the fibromyalgia.

But some fucking cold, or pneumonia was what did it. A week or two before the night she died, she told my dad she couldn‚Äôt pick us up for a while because she couldn‚Äôt drive‚Äî she‚Äôd had a seizure and came back from the hospital.

Which didn‚Äôt even faze me. She went to the hospital for some weird reason or another every year. She was still going to work, a coworker would pick her up in the morning and drive her.

From what I knew she was fine. She sung me happy birthday a week before on a voicemail. Even texted me a couple of days before.

But she fucking died in her sleep. Sometime Monday night on June 4th 2018. Which what the fuck does that mean? How does a 40ish woman just die in her sleep? Was it a seizure? Was it a heart attack? What the fuck was it??

Her coworker came to pick her up in the morning. No answer. She must‚Äôve gotten ahold of the police, or my moms dad.

Grandad texted me and asked me the password to her phone sometime Tuesday. I gave it reluctantly. I had no reason to believe she was dead. That didn‚Äôt even cross my mind.

But it was Wednesday afternoon I found out. We spent the day at my grandmas. Decided to go to the pool at the community center right next to where we used to live. Where I lived for 7 odd years. Where my mom and dad once lived together, until one October night my dad explained that my sister and I would get to have two Halloween‚Äôs.

Oh my god.

That‚Äôs why my dad was upstairs so much.

Holy shit. He even had a bed in his office. Oh my god I‚Äôm just now realizing this. Jesus Christ. How could I be so stupid.

Fuck. Anyways. We were at the pool. We‚Äôd only been there half an hour when grandma called us over to the side of the pool. She told us our dad was gonna pick us up. I don‚Äôt think she knew why.

I knew SOMETHInG was up. Everything seemed wrong. I thought maybe great grandma was sick, and possibly even dead. I thought maybe some grandparent was in the hospital. Anything at all. Mom didn‚Äôt cross my mind.

We got in the car. Swimsuits still dripping. Flip flops and all. He drove down the street, past our old house, and went down the dead end street with the old abandoned park at the end.

When the car turned right to go down that road, I knew where we were going. Something was up. He had some news to tell us.

We parked and he got out of the car and he sat on the concrete cylinder pipe painted bright red and blue. The ones we used to climb on as kids.

I got out of the car but just stood there. Frozen. Then I remembered the text from grandad. I wondered if mom was sick. But I was prepared for him to tell me my great grandmother died.

My dad told my sister and I to come closer. My feet were heavy and unable to move, but I did. And he started crying. My stepmom stood by the tree next to the car.

He asked if I‚Äôd heard anything from grandad. And in that moment he started crying. And I started crying. And he said, ‚ÄúGirls, your mom, she passed away.‚Äù

And I

Died.

I didn‚Äôt know I could produce that many tears at once. They came out. Hot and heavy, in desperation. In agony. I turned around and fell to the earth. Rocks and twigs dug into my bare knees. And I curled up and cried.

Then this fucking hand was on my shoulder. It was bony. It was my stepmoms hand. And I stood up. Tears still flowing like a waterfall. But I was expressionless.

But still they poured.

My sister was clinging to my father.

I got back in the car.

And sat there.

I stopped crying.

Eventually everyone got back in.

I stared out the window. I tried to keep calm. I asked when, how, where, etc.

And we went home.

It was an hour or two before church.

My dad asked if we wanted to go, expecting a no.

But I said yes. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone. Not with my family.

And I thought I‚Äôd be fine. I joked around with my friends even. But it wasn‚Äôt until he started the sermon the tears came out. No one noticed, I think.

I was a silent sobber.

I cried that entire hour.

I sobered up for small groups.

And towards the end. She asked if we had prayer requests, or someone asked if I was okay or something. And I told them.

My mom died.

And I just cried and cried and cried. Everyone fucking hugged me‚Äî held my hand, put a hand on my shoulder.

It was uncomfortable. But at least someone knew.

And Alyssa prayed for me.

Anyways.

I‚Äôm a fucking mess now.

I‚Äôve tried to repress that day.

That place. That park and our old house.

For the next 5 months I recalled every memory I had of my mom. Everything reminded me of her. And anything that did made me cry.

It got bad when school started. At the very mention of the word ‚Äúmom,‚Äù a stray tear would form.

But in October.

We were on a field trip. With the art class. With F.  On a big yellow school bus. I was sitting next to log. We passed the old community where that park was, my old house. Literally every store on that street sent memories I thought I‚Äôd forgotten flying back into my head. And I just cried.

I held it in. I kind of disassociated during the field trip. I barely remember where it was to.

But on the trip back. I lost it. I silently cried the whole way back. No one noticed, and if Log did, he had come to expect that from me by now.

But F noticed. He saw. I think we made eye contact, even 5 rows behind him. I immediately looked away and hid my crying.

But he didn‚Äôt say anything.

And when we got back to school. I went to the bathroom, and banged my head on a wall and cried. Eventually when the halls had cleared a bunch, I left to sneak back into the classroom to grab my backpack. It was a Friday and MYM club was meeting. I snuck in. F noticed me, and I grabbed my bag and left. As I was leaving the room I noticed him get up and head towards me as I left the room. I pretended not to notice.

I had made it out into the hall when he came out of the room a few moments after I did. He called to me, asked if I was okay. We stood so close, right outside his class.

He asked if I was okay, he said he saw me crying on the bus. He asked if something happened on the field trip.

I said no no no. I said I was sorry over and over and over.

He asked what was wrong and I could NOT get the words out of my mouth.

Eventually he just waited for me to explain, and I just said it was hard to go by there again.

He looked confused, I said the town name to clarify.

I said I was sorry a bunch more and teared up.

He asked if I wanted a hug.

I said sure.

And he hugged me. Not for more than two or three seconds.

But someone hugged me.

I hadn‚Äôt been sincerely hugged in forever. Maybe ever.

He asked if I was gonna be ok. I said I was fine and I left and disappeared down the hall.

And I think it was that moment, I became obsessed with him. I needed him to understand my emotional pain. I needed him to know about my mom.

I became so alone and depressed the next few weeks. I cried so much. I was empty. I just looked sad all day long.

But I wanted him to know my emotional pain, because he healed it. When he asked me what was wrong and hugged me. I felt healing. For the first time, from anyone.

And I tried every day to show him my sadness. I LONGED for him to ask me again what was wrong. But being overtly depressed every day just drew him further from me, because I drew so far into myself.

But he made me laugh, and smile, like no other person. He made ME, of all students, feel like I mattered.

And I looked up to him so much.

But no matter how I presented myself, happy, or sad, he never asked what was wrong, and if he did, it was in front of people, or I just said I was fine.

And day as soon as I left the room, I cried because of how awful I was.

I started hating myself. I felt so alone. And I cut myself for the first time.

And in the next two months my self harm got worse and worse and worse. I‚Äôd go home and cut on 90% of days.

And this just made me even more alone. F didn‚Äôt know about my mom. He doesn‚Äôt know how sad I am. He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve been cutting myself because of how stupid and lonely I feel.

I just became obsessed with the goal of showing to him how sad I was. I just wanted him to ask me what was wrong, and tell him about my dead mom.

I‚Äôd go to the cafeteria every day at a precise time when I knew he‚Äôd be there. I got to class on time. I stayed for all clubs. I stayed after school as many days as I could find the excuse to. I even would sit and wait for sometimes an hour out on the steps after school just waiting for him to drive by and wave to me sitting there.

But after months of staying after school almost every day, doing everything I could to help, and spend time in that room, he grew to really trust and rely on me. I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre friends. Not in the way I am with my buddies, but he‚Äôs a friend in the sense a mentor might be.

Sometime somehow he must‚Äôve put the pieces together about my mom. I don‚Äôt know the exact moment. But I know he knows now. I think.

I just don‚Äôt know if he knows how or when. But he‚Äôs gonna know tomorrow because I‚Äôm 100% putting something on my close friends story. Which is literally only him.

Not because he‚Äôs my only close friend. But because I can communicate stuff that seems like I‚Äôm telling everyone but only him.

And he knows about my mom, but I don‚Äôt feel that much better. I do. But I don‚Äôt.

He knows that I cut myself.

Well I convinced him that I used to. That I‚Äôve stopped.

But when he found out I thought I‚Äôd fucked what we had up. But I think it just made our understanding of each other better.

I kind of wish he would ask me if I ever went to see a therapist/counselor so I can tell him I didn‚Äôt.

Maybe then he will realize I haven‚Äôt stopped.

..

Well this wasn‚Äôt much of a diary entry. Just a long story of me being needy.

But I am needy.

I need people. I need him.

I think I‚Äôve moved on from that sad, neediness I had this school year. Especially this last month.

He literally gave me a ride home to my grandmas that day I offered to help him set up the art fair

He confides in me sometimes.

He tells ME first when he‚Äôs got some new idea or plan for something related to the class/school/whatever.

I‚Äôm really happy I‚Äôve been able to get out of that depression.

I‚Äôm not cured.

By no means.

But he is and has been my medicine."

Just been busy whole day with Eid shopping and stuff . Its been whole Ramadan I barely took any class but hopeful to cover it after Eid vacations .

The day was tiring and really hot today .
I was just surfing on my institutes website and found the results came out but thank God it was not mine but I know a person who gave the exams and once was really close to my heart ...

Damn man !!! Everything triggers me again and nostalgia really hits hard and I kept thinking about that time ."
0,"02.06.19. The fortune teller
I went on a trip with my family last summer.

One evening, we were wandering around an ancient, spiritual sector of the city, when we met a man.

I wish I could remember what he called himself.

All I remember is asking him: ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a fortune teller?‚Äù

And he said: ‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù

Then he pulled out a deck of small cards and told me to pick one. He said it would reveal a truth about my spirit.

(Or something similar. I wish I could remember better.)

I asked him, ‚ÄúHow much for this?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free.‚Äù

So I picked a card.

The card said: ◊ô◊ï◊§◊ô

It translates to ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù- inner and outer.

The man looked at me and said: ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù

For a moment, I believed him.

Then my mom said: ‚ÄúWhat? It doesn‚Äôt suit you at all! Give that one to your sister and pick another.‚Äù

So I did.

The second time, I got ‚ÄúSimplicity‚Äù.

The man said: ‚ÄúThis card is for someone who appreciates the simple things. They need little, and live modestly.‚Äù

My mom said: ‚ÄúSee? That one‚Äôs much better for you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs true; I don‚Äôt need much.

But... I wanted to be beautiful.

I wish my mom had let me keep the card."
0,"02.06.19. Feelings
Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm a psychopath.

I can turn my feelings off.

I just tell myself: *Stop.*

And then I do.

My sister used to come to me crying whenever someone hurt her.

My advice was: ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt let it affect you.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how feelings work!‚Äù

And she would cry some more.

Eventually, I learned that the right thing to do was just sit and listen, and try my best to simply understand what she was feeling, rather than tell her to stop.

...But I had to google it.

I never understood why she didn‚Äôt just stop feeling, if it was something that bothered her.

She never understood what the fuck I was talking about. Her feelings didn‚Äôt work like that.

In time, I learned that most people‚Äôs don‚Äôt.

Then last year, I learned that mine don‚Äôt, either.

And I got pushed over the edge, and everything hit me all at once.

I couldn‚Äôt stop feeling.

So I did drugs.

Weed, acid, shrooms, coke, pills, whatever.

Sometimes, I did it to numb my feelings.

Sometimes, I did it to feel anything at all.

And sometimes, I just did it because I was bored.

But no substance in the world could keep me from falling apart last year.

Nothing could stop me from feeling, no matter how hard I tried.

I was totally helpless; a slave to my own thoughts.

And I finally understood what my sister meant when she told me you can‚Äôt just shut feelings off.

So I learned to give in, to just let myself feel whatever I was going to, and ride it out until it went away on its own. Nothing lasts forever- especially not feelings.

For a while, all I did was feel.

I felt more intensely than I ever knew was even possible. I felt emotions I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

But I rode it out, and did what I could to buoy myself until the storm inside my mind passed.

And eventually, it did.

But now, I‚Äôm back where I started.

Every day, I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to do.

Then every night, I smoke weed and have a few drinks, and it keeps the feelings at bay.

All of them.

I‚Äôm numb."

(I'm going to be adding to this as an on going rant about life. Draw from it, IDC, call me out, do what ever.) (Just know, the 1st entry is from another reddit, the rant reddit, so the date for it will be older than me actually making this post on here

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{1st June, 2019}

I criticize a friend for being a druggie

Yelled at one because I'm jelouse of her

Ran one off

And just blocked another for no reason.

Now I'm pissed because I have no one to vent too, like the low life I am. Idk why I'm fucking like this, and apparently no Therapist or what ever can help me, so fuck them.

I hate everything I used to love, drawing, video games, just everything. I can't fucking be normal.

I want to do drugs to get my mind off it, but I hate drugs, as they fucked over my family, and are why I'm here today.

I can't tell if my problem is not being able to follow my dreams (cross-dressing, and becoming a feminine male), have my own privacy, my past, or the fact I chose people like me as friends, and then treat the good people like shit, like they're worthless.

One friend, she's so sweet, but I just yell at her, because I'm so angry. For all I know, rn, she could be fucking dead, and the last thing I've said to her ""is fuck off""

I don't know what to use, I can't excuse myself, but if I just back down, I'll look confused, and I don't like that

I don't get why all these people can find love 'n shit. Why? Why do I always get stuck in the long distance relationship, with somebody that smokes pot and drinks Alcholol, barely even talks to me, and rely on them to help me.

Why can't I go church? I keep getting told god can help me, but rn he isn't...but I feel like if I turn on him now, I'll be fucked even more

I go to some group that's ment To help me handle this all, but I just feel like everyone else, some depressed asshole, who blames everyone. I'm a Hippocrate.

I debated doing drugs today, seeing how chill my friend was, then yelled at him for it...

One of my only irl friends is leaving, well, has left today, and won't be back for a month. He cares about me as a friend, and is chill, he's like me, except not an asshole

Idk what to do, hell, I'll probably delete this shit.

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{2nd June, 2019}

My partner and I got into an argument over hormones. I just want to be more feminine. I'm tired of looking masculine. But this seemed to have rubbed her the wrong way. So now she's drunk, and just degrading me...

But I deserve it...maybe it'd be best I just died in a whole, maybe...maybe not...my dog would be sad, but he probably doesn't care either, just sees me at the human who feeds him and lets him shit.

I don't want to get religious, but maybe God is telling me something...maybe he's telling me to fucking stop. Just end it. Or maybe stop, and just be normal... I'm not sure. But what ever it is, I'd much rather be dead right now than what I'm feeling. I'm so tired. I don't want to kill myself directly. Maybe a bus hitting me, or a robber shooting me? Something normal. I mean, if I have to, I'll off myself, but it's not preferred...

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{5th June, 2019}

I'm doing a bit better. Currently taking a day off from walking, as it rained today, so no working out for this boio. I wanted to give some insight to myself.

I'm a male, but I enjoy being small, feminine, and am a bottom. I'm pretty much Into anything that has a dick, or can have a strap-on, and is dominant in bed. I'm not just sexual though, and am pretty complex when it comes to love, yet pretty simple. But the sex part of my love life is easier to explain.

Crossdressing boy, who looks feminine, but has a dicc, likes it up the ass from dominant partners.

Basically, my current partner is a mistress of sorts ...it started off as a slave type rp, just for fun, but it grew into our conversation as well...we got to know.kore about each other, and I think I'm in love with her. She and I don't wanna be too rash, as we're long distance, but she is like me, and is jelouse, and a little possessive. Not creepy ""you can't see your family"" possessive, just we hate cheating, and the thought of it, and will tell each other if someone tries to get us to cheat. We're also pretty open to each other about knowing who we talk to, and aren't weird about letting us see our phones, unless it's a personal family matter.

But all that's just side talk.

Yesterday, she and I got to talking. I was calm, and so was she...

We talked, and honestly, I feel stupid saying all that shit the other day... I'm just weird I guess...well, not weird, just a fucking jerk.

{8th June, 2019}

She accused me of cheating. Why? Because I thought she wanted to do a job Biology related. She told me to fuck off and to go to my biology hoe. So I fucked off. I am now wanting to end it all, but all I can think of is how my grandma and dog would react."

It‚Äôs so late. But I‚Äôll recap.

Woke up late.

I think I read for a little bit. Maybe.

I know we went to the car dealership.

We‚Äôve had this piece of junk for 10 years, and it‚Äôs time to get another.

I was 7 when I was there last.

Funny how time flies. Lives change.

We ate at Schlotzkys or however it‚Äôs spelled. Which was like a fuckin‚Äô flashback to being 7 again. We used to eat there with dad, AND mom.

Separate of course. But there.

Went to P and S‚Äôs grad party. Ate some fruit, socialized a bit.

P dared me to take a bite out of an onion as if it were an apple. I did.

I can still taste it.

My parents were looking at Honda Pilots.

F drives a Honda Pilot.

Oh yeah.. F.

I sent him a message, I‚Äôll just paste it. I‚Äôm too tired to write/summarize.

‚ÄúHey I was just wondering if there were any days you were going to be at school working on stuff sometime in the next 3 weeks, if I could stop by and use the ferric chloride/press. I promise I‚Äôll try and stay out of the way! It probably won‚Äôt take me very long to do what I need to do.

I‚Äôve ordered some stuff I think is the solution to all the issues I‚Äôve been having with printing, and It‚Äôd be really helpful to test it out before I go and spend a lot of time etching a bunch of plates. (Just in case this ground is a dud as well.)

But if you‚Äôre not gonna be in the classroom any time this month, or you‚Äôd rather just work alone, it‚Äôs totally cool and I can wait till later! Just let me know. Thanks!‚Äù

And to which he replied,

‚ÄúSure! I think I am going to try to go Thursday. Let me see what‚Äôs happening this week and I‚Äôll let you know for sure. Actually, I was thinking I could probably use an assistant for some things I‚Äôm doing this summer. I‚Äôll let you know. I wouldn‚Äôt need your help the whole time, so you could do your thing too. ‚Äú

And to which I responded,

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to help out with anything I can! And well I just ordered the stuff yesterday, so I‚Äôm hoping it will arrive in the next 2-3 days. So I‚Äôm hoping it all gets here before at least Wednesday, which I‚Äôm sure it will. But if you‚Äôre going to try and be at school Thursday, that would be awesome!
Thanks a billion!‚Äù

And he said,

‚ÄúCool. Thanks. I‚Äôll keep in touch.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm realizing I should have worded things differently.

Anyways. After dinner I got really sad

Boo hoooo

I cut myself in the bathtub and watched the blood drip drip drip onto the tub floor. Then I did the other leg and took a shower.

I talked to some kid who kind of reminds me of me when I was 14. She‚Äôs nice. Just a little naive. I feel bad for her.

I think I read some more somwhere in the day bbut I can‚Äôt remember.

I wrote a poem too. It‚Äôs got its own post.

I wish I could tell him what I wrote.

But maybe that‚Äôs too far.

A lot happened today.

Some good, some bad, some in-between.

There were so many little adventures; so much I could write about.

I can‚Äôt think of what to say.

So much happens all the time.

But when I sit down and try to write it all out like a normal fucking diary entry, my mind goes blank.

I don‚Äôt know how to recap my day.

...

That was gonna be the end of my entry. But then right before I hit the ‚Äúpost‚Äù button, my housemate came in.

He said: ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou were gone all day.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúWell, you were out at some point.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúUm... I went to Tim Horton‚Äôs.‚Äù

I tried to think of more.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

Luckily, my housemate filled the silence.

He said: ‚ÄúYou kind of blink in and out of existence, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt make a single sound all day. I didn‚Äôt know you were home.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWell, I was out for some of it. Like, I just got home.‚Äù

But it was 9:30 at night. I knew I hadn‚Äôt just come from a coffee shop.

Where had I been all day?

I know I had a full day. I know I did stuff.

What did I do?

Obviously, I know where I was and what I did all day.

If I really think about it, the details are there.

But it‚Äôs like I only live from one moment to the next.

I‚Äôm running on autopilot.

Or maybe I‚Äôm just running.

It‚Äôs like my housemate said.

I kind of just blink in and out of existence."

0,"A false beginning
I am almost exactly where I wanted to be... yet something seems a little off.

&#x200B;

I wanted to improve my GPA and so I did, although not as much as I had planned, but nevertheless I did not fall much short from my original goal.

&#x200B;

I had been eagerly waiting for finals week to end so that I could finally see her again. But as soon as  they ended, my overwhelming desire to rush back to her wilted as with the same intensity as it has surfaced. I decided to not go and see her, Don't get me wrong, I still have a MAJOR crush on her. But something feels different and I can not put my finger on it.

&#x200B;

Then fate decided to drag me back from Karachi and shoved my in her lap. It was oblivion for exactly 5 hours. After that the oblivion faded away. I yearned for her yet I did not feel like being in her presence (Although there was no way around it). We fell asleep same bed but the distance between our bodies and the prying eyes of the world made it seem like we were on completely different hemispheres of the Earth. Heck her hand was barely a few millimeters from mine yet my hand could not extend and embrace hers.

&#x200B;

It is as if she has drifted apart but in a different way. I have better conversations with her than ever before. She initiates conversations more than ever. She shows that she understands me more than she has ever shown. I yearn for her more than I ever have. Sometimes all my mind agrees on doing is  fixating upon how soft, warm and captivating her naked body would feel. How homely and comforting her gentle touches would be and how rich her laugh would be in the absence of any other entity except ours. Yet, I feel she is further away from me than she has ever been. Every time I look at her, I am reminded of how unnecessary my affection is for her. TBH, I have never admired and envied anyone as much before. I want to be like her. I want to learn to live life in the same carefree and optimistic way that she does. I want to have that unwavering faith in myself just like she has.

&#x200B;

It is the 27th night of Ramadan and she is upstairs praying to God. And here I am, a closeted agnostic, a self-proclaimed smartass with nothing to show for it, a recipient of favors that I do not feel deserving of, a hopeless romantic that has nothing of significance to contribute to anyone's life. The only thing I carry is the promise to improve in great strides and the shit-tonne of uncertainty that is naturally associated with any and all such promises.

&#x200B;

I want that completeness, that iron dome of immunity from the opinions and actions of the world just like she has. Do I love her? Or am I just entranced by how much she resembles my ideal self? She is already where I want to be. Would my ideal self ever romantically love someone who was behind in the journey? I feel like I should be able to answer that question but I am not certain. I am not certain because I am afraid the real answer might very well be ""no"".

&#x200B;

What stops me from confessing to her? The unimaginable distances. The fact that if she rejects me I would still have to keep seeing her, her family and pretend everything is fine. I am BAD at acting. I am bad at keeping my discomfort within the confines of my heart. It always finds a way and shows...on my face, my demeanor, my voice...somehow or the other it finds a way to creep out and express itself  And she'll see it. What should I do?"

Annnnd it‚Äôs already Friday night.

This week went by fast.

But so does every week, so what‚Äôs new?

Also random side note, I‚Äôve been reading the notes I‚Äôve made in the notes app and I found a TON of freaky ass dreams I have barely any recollection of.

Dreams about bathroom crockpots, skinny birds, and F, and Wendy‚Äôs, and F again. Weird shit.

F shows up a lot in my dreams. Which I‚Äôm not mad about. I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs changed. For a long time when he‚Äôd appear in my dreams he was unnaturally hostile, then he would ignore me.

It‚Äôs different now. But I‚Äôd like to think our relationship is different.

Or maybe the underlying relationship to myself has changed. Maybe I don‚Äôt hate my guts as much anymore. Maybe my mental health has improved.

Speaking of hating my guts and F, I posted some dumb pics of me being stupid and said something edgy like

‚ÄúI literally hate myself so much.
Can someone surgically remove my brain because it‚Äôs being rlly mean lately >:-(‚Äú

And F responded. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre swell.‚Äù

Just that. While I was at work.

My heart melted a bit but I was too busy taking inventory/answering the phone/taking orders all at once.

I fuckin love that man. He‚Äôs like my dad who‚Äôs not my dad. He‚Äôs just fucking great‚Äî beyond great! He‚Äôs perfect, yet perfectly imperfect.

He‚Äôs been there for me when I literally wanted to die. He‚Äôs been there for me when I felt useless, he‚Äôs been there for me when I felt like I was annoying him. He‚Äôs been there for me when I‚Äôve been stupid. He‚Äôs been there for me even after he found out I‚Äôve been fucking cutting myself. He‚Äôs been there for me when I felt uninspired. He‚Äôs ALWAYS been there for me. Maybe not so much the last two years, but I barely had his class.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without him. He‚Äôs a father figure, and a mentor, yet a friend. He inspires me to go above and beyond. But is never disappointed with me when I slip up. He‚Äôs the only serious artist I know in my life who isn‚Äôt some flamboyant annoying fuck. I love him.

Anyways. Enough of me gushing about my fuckin‚Äô art teacher for today.

...

Today was okay.

I didn‚Äôt get out of bed until 10.

I was fairly productive for an hour and a half. Ordered some much needed art supplies. Ordered two new books with my gift card from my birthday. Both books by the co-authors of art and fear.

I finally wrote Grammy back. I just gave her my address and said hi.

I cleaned my room too. Which didn‚Äôt take long. My room is so empty, it‚Äôs hard to not keep clean.

I ate some lunch, then some more food. So much for starting my diet. After that I watched a new episode of the new Twilight Zone.

After that I went outside and drew a little bit came back in after a short time because I was being bit by bugs.

Eventually I got ready for work, and did that.

Today was boring.

I read more of art and fear for a while.

My brain is shutting down.

Basically. I miss F.

I miss my friends a lot too.

But I miss him most of all.

I really wonder if I‚Äôm mentally ill.

If you asked me now. I‚Äôd say no.

But take one look at my diary, or one look into my head and my emotions. I probably am.

Just today I considered dropping my clean streak and slicing up my thighs to high heaven.

I really want to. Just one at least.

Or to pick at scabs.

It just disgusts me when I have to look at my thighs on the toilet.

Scars that look like gaping wounds. Still dark pink‚Äî almost red.

Scars that look like...  cuts.

I wish the whole world didn‚Äôt fucking care and I could walk around and have them invisible to others.

0,"31.05.19. A river called Denial
I did a lot of research on abuse.

Went on a Google deep-dive. Even posted a couple questions on some Internet forums.

And what I learned is this:

When someone‚Äôs being abused, on a deeper, fundamental level they already know that something is wrong. Even when they seem completely oblivious, deep down, they know.

I learned a lot about abuse.

There were a lot of things I recognized, things I didn‚Äôt even know counted as being bad.

‚ÄúAbuse‚Äù is kind of a strong word.

But when I read that little paragraph, it hit me.

Deep down, I already knew.

Something is wrong with my family."

It was another plain depressing day.

I went to the bank to get money for my weekly rent. I went out to eat at a restaraunt for lunch and then i went to walmart.

At walmart i got some bodywash, new work shoes and a foot roller for my feet to massage it. I was gonna get this portable evaporative cooler but it was gonna make me go over budget so ill get it another time.

Then i went to aldi's and got a few things.
While i was waiting for the bus, i met someone new. We chatted for a bit and exchanged snapchat usernames. He lives two towns over from me and he is not my type but he probably not gay. I could use another friend tho.

I took my first quiz in one of my new classes and got a B. Hooray. I have a two page essay that i have write about myself. That requires alot of brain juice so i have to prepare for that. My english class will make me write so much more. I dont know if i can handle it.

While i was sitting in my pity puddle, there was something from the college brochure that stuck out. It said that i dont have to keep my current job just to go to the free online school. It means i can free myself. Only thing i worry about is being able to catch on with what to do at a job and transportation. It is what always stop me.

Tomorrow or technically today, i plan on seeing my older sister that lives in an assistive living home. It will be nice out so ill dress comfortably."

Sometimes I forget what happens in a day until I go to write it all down and it all comes flooding back. If we just take the time to remember, most of the time, the memory is right there.

I woke up. God dressed. Felt a little edgy and wore my shorts and striped shirt and some dark makeup.

I ended up just feeling really fat today.

Some days I just feel fatter than others.

I catch a glimpse of myself walking in front of a reflective window and see how fucking big my torso is.

I REALLY need to lose weight.

I just need to control my diet. If I can control my productivity, I can control what I eat.

Mind over matter.

Anyways. Ate a fucking McDonald‚Äôs breakfast. Went over to grandmas and we talked about shopping. Go figure.

We went to Dick‚Äôs. My sister looked for some shorts. I looked around secretly hoping to find some longer cycling shorts or something. I realized I needed at least ONE pair of shorts that can get wet at camp.

I tried on a pair and I just felt fat.

It‚Äôs hard to shop when you just feel fat and gross.

We left there and went to the shoe store. I was kind of turned off by it all. Shoe shopping isn‚Äôt very fun. I‚Äôd rather order something online, and besides, my heart is set on those doc martens.

I did get a pair of socks that have cherry pies on them. They‚Äôre super cute. That made me feel a little better. I may be fat, but I‚Äôve got cute socks!

We went to the thrift store after that. I always gravitate to the same clothes. I bought some of what I usually end up getting.

I did get this nice faded orange pink linen shirt that I can‚Äôt wait to wear. And some funky earrings.

We tried to find a place to eat, and it turned into a fucking nightmare because of my sister. It‚Äôs so hard to find somewhere to eat with her fucking picky ass palate.

I hate her guts sometimes. We‚Äôve been fighting a ton more recently.

In the car ride there, F messaged the group chat more about the Santa Fe trip. He said the price was likely to be around 1,300$ instead of 1,000$. Shit.

I eventually figured out that I‚Äôd just not dye my hair at the salon anymore and I could save some of the extra money there.

Then he was saying he really needed 10 people to go or else the trip was going to be a lot more expensive per person, plus he couldn‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôd all get on the same flight.

Only 6-7 people responded to say that they would come if they could afford it. Two for sure said yes. (Me and M.)

I DMed him about something related to it and all hope isn‚Äôt lost. He‚Äôs not going to give up. ‚ÄúNot by a long shot.‚Äù

Later in the day he texted the whole group again and said that he‚Äôd talked to a school administrator and we should probably have a meeting about it soon, before the end of the month.

We went back to grandmas after lunch.

I‚Äôm so grateful for my grandma. I love her so much. I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to afford the clothes I really needed this summer, and she said she‚Äôd order them for me. EVEN the doc martens. (They‚Äôre sandals, not 200$ boots haha.)

On the drive back to our house, I got super tired out of nowhere. I barely made it in the house.

After I got inside I saw how nice the sun looked outside and I decided if I were going to rest, I might as well do it out in the sun. So I slathered on some sunscreen and put a towel out on the patio and just listened to podcasts for an hour and a half.

My sister eventually joined me, but she put on her whole fucking swimsuit. I was just out there in my T-shirt and jean shorts. Literally the only skin exposed to the sun on me was my arms, just past my elbow, my legs past my knees, and my face.

I‚Äôm gonna end up with a weird tan eventually.

Maybe. I don‚Äôt know if I tan. I‚Äôve never tried. I‚Äôm always a pale ghost, or bob the tomato. Never in between.

So that‚Äôs one of my goals this summer. Get tan.

After laying out in the sun cooking for an hour and a half, I felt heavy and sweaty so I took a cold shower.

After that I had some dinner and after dinner I talked with my stepmom for over an hour almost.

We talked about college, and sales, and the future. And jobs and money and adult life.

She basically started to sell me on being a salesperson. They make GOOD money at her company. It would be a great job. If I got hired there, I could be living on my own and pay off my student debt at the same time. Over a few years of course.

She thought I‚Äôd be good at sales. Really anyone can be.

Anyways, I won‚Äôt type out the entire convo.

I basically decided that I want to go to art college because I know it‚Äôs what I want to do throughout my life, even if it‚Äôs not my main source of income. And that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôve always been okay with that.

But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I want to learn as much about art as I can.

So after that long, inspiring, but draining conversation, I went back to my room and decided to go on a walk.

I walked down to the little shopping area near my house. Walked in the grocery store and up and down the isles, and then left without a thing.

Then I fucking went to McDonald‚Äôs and bought some chicken nuggets like the fat ass I am.

Honestly out of everything embarrassing I‚Äôve ever written in this damn diary, that takes the cake by far.

I walked back home and sat down at my desk and started to read my book but I only made it two pages in before my brain gave up.

I then made a packing list of what I‚Äôm going to bring to art camp this July.

I thought I didn‚Äôt have the energy to write tonight, but I guess I was wrong.

I‚Äôm gonna sleep good tonight.

Tomorrow maybe I‚Äôll start on some art."
0,"30.05.19. Today, I woke up happy
Mornings are tough for me.

My life is so full of chaos. My days are all so unpredictable.

So most mornings, when I wake up, I have no idea how the day will go.

Will I have a good day? A bad day?

It‚Äôs impossible to predict.

And it makes me miserable.

Because most days, I have no idea what to expect.

I know how many problems I already have. I know how often new problems come up. And I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take.

Most mornings, I wake up and wish I hadn‚Äôt.

Usually, when I wake up, I‚Äôm already exhausted.

Sometimes it feels like life has really put me through the ringer. And it feels so unfair that I have to keep trying to handle whatever life wants to throw at me. It feels like the hits just keep coming.

But this morning, I woke up happy.

I still don‚Äôt know what to expect.

But today, I know I can take it.

And I‚Äôm excited to try."

0,"9:33 PM 5/29/19
I made myself wait to the end of the day, and I‚Äôm glad.

I woke up at 6 this morning. I dreamt of something or another. Something insignificant that will probably be explored again by my subconscious if I dream tonight.

I woke up at 6, but didn‚Äôt get up until 9. I took a shower, and somehow managed to do nothing but fuck around on my phone until 11.

I ate some leftover spaghetti for lunch. Watched some dumb ass Jim Carrey movie, Yesman. It wasn‚Äôt good, AT ALL. I hope I never remember that movie.

I sat around some more and finally stopped procrastinating and go work on some figure/gesture drawings. I‚Äôm really trying to say no to procrastination ‚Äî as much as Jim Carrey says yes to life, I say no to my lazy desires.

I sat down at my desk with the comfortingly simple notepad my grandma gave me. Nothing fancy at all. Just plain, notebook paper.

I watched a video and a half on the theory and technique of gesture drawing and realized that I just had to fucking do it if I wanted to understand it.

I found a website that has free images, and literally sketched my worse. It was like exercising my some distant brain and hand muscle I‚Äôve barely tapped into before. It was rewarding, and fun to explore.

There‚Äôs a greater wonder and magic in learning to make art rather than finish a long slaved over piece. (For me anyways.)

My first drawings were literal dog shit, and I crumpled them up and threw them into a pile on my desk. But when I finished a second sheet, I crumpled it up not solely because I was embarrassed by it, but because these drawings DO NOT MATTER. They are the result of exercise. The sweat of artmaking. You wouldn‚Äôt bottle and frame the sweat from a workout?

(Although THAT would sure be an innovative art piece!)

I finally stopped after a while. I definitely stopped too soon, but early enough for my brain to not get so bored with it.

In the end I threw all of the sketches away and kept the last one I did for reference when I practice again. Hopefully soon.

Here is a picture of four of the sheets in progression from first to last. [https://prnt.sc/nv77og](https://prnt.sc/nv77og)

Hard to see, but that‚Äôs what I get for crumpling them up.

Anywhoo.. after that I got dressed because people were coming over to sign for the car. It was an odd experience. I had to do the writing. I sold it to some 22 year old who graduated from the same high school I go to.

My dad kept trying to make smalltalk with her dad about the tornado yesterday.

And there it was. 2k in cash. In my hands. The most money I‚Äôve ever held at once.

It was weird. Saying goodbye. Although I didn‚Äôt really get a chance. I force myself to not be sentimental about mom around my dad.

Speaking of which. I haven‚Äôt replied to my moms mom. I don‚Äôt want to, but I should. Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow or Friday.

After the car business was over, I dicked around the house for three hours until it was time for church. My sister has been driving me insane lately. She‚Äôs SO mean sometimes. She does this thing where she won‚Äôt admit she‚Äôs ever wrong. She‚Äôll lie about her contractions and even lie about lying, and then make ME look like the dumbass. I really DO NOT like that.

She‚Äôs always loved picking fights and trying to get reactions from me, but I really fucking hate when she acts like she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs doing.

Dad made oven raviolis and I sat down with mine on a plate waiting for the sauce to be finished microwaving. My sister brought out the sauce ‚Äî and she does these tiny little things to piss me off, like when carrying the hot bowl with oven mitts to the table, your first response would be to set down the bowl on the table right?

But noooo, she had to hold the fuckin‚Äô bowl and try to pull out the chair with her elbows. JUST SO I COULDN‚ÄôT touch the sauce.

Then she sat down and when she was removing the bowl from under the hot plate, she moved the bowl directly next to her between her plate and the empty plate next to hers.

We ALWAYS put the bow in the middle. It makes natural sense. But she FUCKING PUT THE BOWL RIGHT THERE.

And when I pointed it out to her, instead of saying hey I can‚Äôt reach the sauce, I said L can‚Äôt reach the sauce because she was sitting right next to me. And my sister was like, but L isn‚Äôt eating raviolis all innocent like, knowing full well I‚Äôve been waiting for her to bring the sauce to the table.

I just fucking LOST it. The tears started flowing out from my eyes fast and hot and I just yelled at her with a genuinely hurt voice and took my food to my room.

She‚Äôs so fucking cruel sometimes, and she always wonders why I hate her. She always wonders why I think she‚Äôs dumb. BECAUSE SHE FUCKING IS!

She‚Äôs done things like this all week, it‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt get enough attention from the friends she FaceTimes all day, and is doing so as I type at fuckin‚Äô 10 PM.

Anyways. I cooled down a tiny bit and we went to church. We played 9 square. I was average. We found out our team for camp. We‚Äôre the black team. Black Panther themed. Great! üôÑ
I tripped on the concrete and skinned my toe and knee and hand and landed hard on my butt. When I fall, it‚Äôs like a fucking skyscraper going down‚Äî tall and heavy.

Later after church we went back out to play more 9 square and I was fuckin killing it! I‚Äôve never been so good, I finally figured out the best technique to get people out. I felt proud that people recognized I was doing well.

I‚Äôm still mad at my sister, but I‚Äôm going to be the adult here. She makes herself look dumb all the time. I don‚Äôt need to do anything to make that happen. And when it happens. I stay silent.

When I got home I went to my room and sat at my desk and read more from Art & Fear. I reread the chapter on teaching, and read some new chapters towards the end. I underlined some stuff too. I‚Äôve never done that with a book before on my own.

Then I found a stopping place so I could go write my diary entry for the day then go to sleep.

So goodnight world."

0,"29.05.19. Every flavour Oreo
I have a new mission in life.

At the local supermarket near my house one day, I discovered an entire shelf wall full of different Oreo flavours, sizes, thicknesses, and colours.

I had never seen so much Oreo variety before.

I was immediately enthralled.

Every now and then I‚Äôd show it to a friend, and they would be equally surprised at the sheer mass of different kinds of Oreos right there under our noses.

I became determined to try them all at least once.

So from then on, every time we ran out of Oreos, I‚Äôd buy a new flavour.

It was fun the first few times.

Then I got depressed and forgot about it.

Until today, when I stumbled upon a package of Coconut-Flavoured Oreo Thins in our pantry. I couldn‚Äôt believe they survived the move.

(We lost so many important things when we moved. But we held onto the coconut flavoured Oreos.)

Anyways, today I tried coconut flavoured Oreos.

They were surprisingly good.

I gave some to a friend and she agreed.

So we got to talking, and she asked me why I even bought those to begin with, so I told her about the shelf in the grocery store and my whole mission.

Then I declared: ‚ÄúNext time I‚Äôm buying the carrot cake flavoured ones!‚Äù

I‚Äôm gonna try every flavour Oreo.

I will not die in peace until I succeed.

And in the meantime, I have something new to try. Something exciting to look forward to.

For now, it‚Äôs Carrot Cake Flavoured Oreos.

But it makes me laugh.

Which makes me happy.

Someone told me today: ‚ÄúYou know, you seem like you‚Äôre doing a lot better lately.‚Äù

And I realized they were right.

I am."

Today was national hamburger day.

It‚Äôs not like that matters or anything, I just thought I‚Äôd start with that.

Although I did think work would be busier because of that. Maybe everyone was frightened off by the tornadoes. Business was slow tonight.

I texted Aug in the bathroom about it all. Kind of.

Long story short, my dad and sister went on the storm chase of their lives without me. I‚Äôm a bit sad. At least I won‚Äôt be exhausted tomorrow?

The tornado damage was bad north west of me. I hope no lives were lost.

I ate room temperature tacos for dinner and pondered the situation.

I talked with my step mom about my troubles in the world of art making. About this damn etching ground and shit.

That led me to go get my laptop and actually research it some more. Apparently it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have to be shipped all the way from the UK! There is a printmaking supplier in Albuquerque that sells it! I‚Äôm saved!

Thank god for the Southwest.

The Santa Fe/Albuquerque area must just be a hub for art, especially printmaking. I want to do SO much research before I go. I want to make the most of that trip, if it ends up happening.

...

My dad just came into my room and told me that he got an offer on the car. $2,000. That‚Äôs 2k I can put towards a car of my own. That helps so much. So fucking much!

I‚Äôm sad to sell moms old car. It really made me uneasy just seeing it in our driveway. Now I have to be there to sign over the car to some stranger. The car I‚Äôve had so many memories in.

Gone.

Just like mom.

But I‚Äôm trying to get over it. I‚Äôm trying to get over her. Not forget, I‚Äôll never let that happen. I just need to get over her death. And I sound selfish, and that‚Äôs OK.

Anyways, I‚Äôm going to go to bed now. Maybe I‚Äôll dream tonight!

Sweet dreams me, and anyone else who may read this. Sweet dreams to future me who someday will inevitably re read these to figure out where I fucked up.

I hope you don‚Äôt fuck things up too much. You‚Äôve got to hold onto what you‚Äôve got.

Edit:

After all that talk about moving on, I just checked my email and got an email from my moms mom.

I guess they had a family meeting and shared memories and cried and what not. They asked about me, and still think of my sister and I as family.

It‚Äôs just so hard. I don‚Äôt feel the same way about them. I‚Äôve never liked them. But they ARE family, and I love them for that.

I don‚Äôt want to think about mom.

I don‚Äôt want this to seep into my dreams.

I don‚Äôt want them in my life anymore."
0,"28.05.19. First day back from home
I had a really good day today.

I woke up feeling like shit, physically and mentally.

Yesterday I crashed and passed out before it was even dark outside. But yesterday fucking sucked.

I had full-on paranoia, worse than I‚Äôve had in a while. I felt like a lunatic.

To calm down, I tried going for a walk to the corner store for some tea. We have tea at home, but usually walking helps me calm down.

But there were more people out than usual, most of them men.

And then at the tea station, were three huge, tall, bulky, scary-looking guys. And they looked really similar to the boys...

You know which boys.

One of them had exactly the same hair- cut, colour, everything.

I almost had a meltdown right there in the store.

But I told myself I was being ridiculous, and that it‚Äôs time to overcome this bullshit. Nothing even really happened.

Plus, I was worried that if I ran, they would chase me. It‚Äôs always easier to go the path of least resistance.

So I stood right next to them and got my tea anyways.

That mindset is probably why I get raped so often.

I just can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt even puke.

By the time I left the corner store, I was in full blown fight-or-flight.

Luckily, I was already high and I‚Äôm naturally pretty good at controlling my expressions, because the absolute last thing I wanted was to have a crazy, screaming panic attack in public.

So of course some tweaker locked eyes and walked straight at me, lurching across the sidewalk like a zombie.

My fight-or-flight response is freeze, which means when I get really scared I do nothing.

It‚Äôs definitely the worst one to have.

It means I‚Äôm completely helpless.

By that point, I don‚Äôt even know what was going through my head. I was so anxious I just went on autopilot.

Until a motorcycle roared past.

The sound startled me so much I spilled my tea.

I looked like a crazy person.

I can‚Äôt believe I actually jumped. It was like I was playing a movie character with PTSD. That shit‚Äôs not real life. This isn‚Äôt my real life.

How can that have happened to me?

By the time I made it home I was a wreck.

I even accidentally told my other housemate that I‚Äôve started doing drugs again. He was so disappointed.

Then I went right up to my room and fell asleep.

So when I woke up at 3 or 4am this morning, I wasn‚Äôt too happy about it. I was hoping to sleep forever.

But I fell back asleep a little later, and didn‚Äôt wake up again until 9 o‚Äôclock.

So I really wasn‚Äôt expecting to have a good day today.

When I woke up again, I still had all the awful thoughts from yesterday running through my head.

Plus, my stomach *really* hurt - badly enough for me to even acknowledge it. I have a really high pain tolerance, so it takes a lot for me to even notice it.

(It was probably the two plates of nachos I ate yesterday out of spite even though I‚Äôm supposed to be cutting back on gluten. Stupid fucking celiac.)

But I forgot - I had already booked math tutoring.

I was set to meet him in an hour.

Fuck.

So I told myself I would go to tutoring, finish all my online work for this week, and then I could go right back to bed.

I also told myself not to eat any gluten today.

So I rolled myself out of bed and out the door, and grabbed a piece of fruit and some coffee on the way.

Then tutoring went really well.

We even went half an hour over time to finish a tough problem, then just ended up chatting for a little while longer after that.

By the time I left, my mood had picked up.

And when I got back home, my housemates were hanging out in the kitchen. So I got another piece of fruit for a snack and stayed with them.

We had a fantastic time. I love hanging out with them.

And the fruit made my stomach stop hurting.

My housemate even told me she noticed I‚Äôve been doing a lot better with school and doing all my work. I haven‚Äôt missed any deadlines so far or anything.

She said she can see how hard I‚Äôm trying. And that she can also see how much better I‚Äôve gotten.

That made me feel really, *really* good.

Then - Drew showed up. Uninvited. Again.

But this time, my friends were there, too. So I finally mustered up the courage to tell him to leave and to stop coming to my house without permission.

And he left!!

He even texted me an apology after.

Although, he also texted me to make plans. And to guilt-trip me for not responding to his other texts.

You win some, you lose some.

Then I bought groceries while my housemates cleaned the house. It was a win-win for everyone, since they like cleaning and I like running errands.

The weather was cold and grey, but not rainy.

That‚Äôs my favourite weather!

What can I say? Maybe I‚Äôm just a weirdo.

But I love the cold, because it keeps me awake. When it gets too hot, I zone out. And I don‚Äôt like when it‚Äôs too bright outside, because my eyes are sensitive.

On the way home, one of the grocery bags broke and stuff fell all over the place.

But right away, a really nice lady gave me a new one. Not even a plastic one! She gave me a reusable bag, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it breaking again.

She swore up and down she just got it for free and didn‚Äôt even use it before I let her give it to me.

That made my whole day!

Overall, today has been great.

I love days like this, because they‚Äôre the kind of days that feel like they can happen again. I want all of my days to be like this. Or at least, like, most of them.

I just hope I can keep it up."

I‚Äôve been writing my diary entries earlier in the day lately. It‚Äôs a bit weird but so am I.

Last night was a mess for me. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I made it to be though. I was just being... overemotional. Lol.

I got back on that discord server I found a few months ago. Someone really nice was talking to me and helped me out of my blues. Turned out to be someone who I‚Äôd already talked to on that server before. We kind of had a mini reunion. She‚Äôs so nice. She‚Äôs like my internet mother who doesn‚Äôt feel like a mom, but literally is? Idk.

We talked for a while. The poor thing. I thought my SH issues were bad, she used to cut to 100, two or three times a day.

I can‚Äôt even imagine being in a place that bad.

Later last evening I started texting Aug. I really think he looks up to me. I don‚Äôt know why. He‚Äôs so confident and open about his struggles. His life is kind of an open book, and I‚Äôm a tad jealous?

We talked about summer, and the camps we are going to. He‚Äôs doing a design camp at another local college in a week or two. I thought about doing it last year, but didn‚Äôt have the $.

We talked about hair, and podcasts, and frog culture. He‚Äôs such a goof. We talked a bit about sexuality and agenderism and shit. I don‚Äôt know if I want to put that label on myself, because I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs completely accurate.

But from a definition standpoint, I‚Äôm somewhere on the spectrum. I just don‚Äôt want to identify with it.

Anyways, I didn‚Äôt go to bed until midnight. I didn‚Äôt get up until 9. I tend to eat so much during summer. I need to stop eating out of boredom. Seriously. I‚Äôve gained all the weight I‚Äôve lost back.

I tried to draw this morning but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to. I have been pretty out of it all day. I doodled a bit, but nothing noteworthy. I‚Äôm really anxious. My calendar sits on my wall watching me with disappointment.

It watches me and wonders when I‚Äôll get my shit together and make good art. I‚Äôm disappointed with myself because I‚Äôve got this entire month to work, but I don‚Äôt know what on.

I didn‚Äôt do anything productive, just stared out my window wishing some revelation would come to me. I‚Äôve got vague ideas about subject matter floating throughout my head, it‚Äôs just when I chase after those ideas, contradictions and fears hold me back and drown me.

I watched the last how to train your dragon movie on tv. I never really liked the series, I just can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 9 years since the first one came out. I wasted an hour and a half on that, and ate lunch.

Social media is killing me. I get so self conscious. I don‚Äôt have many pictures. I don‚Äôt post often. My art is shit. My art is not meant to live on Instagram, yet I find myself thinking it must.

I felt like I really needed some art encouragement, so I got up and went to my room and started reading Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland.

We‚Äôve read a chapter or two for class assignments before, and they totally rocked my mind. We‚Äôre supposed to read the whole book as part of our summer work.

The book is so comforting in an indescribable way. I love it, and I see why it is one of F‚Äôs favorite books.

I flipped to the chapter on art in the academic world where it talks about teaching and students and books and stuff.

The section on teaching made me cry. It really made me realize what a gem F is. I can tell this book has really shaped who he is, and what he strives to be.

I stopped reading after a while because my brain is just too foggy. I don‚Äôt want to miss anything. I want to read this book a hundred times. Or at least 5. I want F to know I‚Äôve enjoyed and learned from this book as much as him.

I also figured out the solution to my problems with etching, the only problem is that materials are expensive, and the ground is only produced in the UK. I can‚Äôt afford to wait a month for it to ship.

I need the ground today. I need to etch plates ASAP. I want to go in to school and work on printing with F.

But I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just not possible. I wish I could figure things out now.

My brain is in a knot I think. I don‚Äôt have any detangler. This book helps me free up the brain fog, but just makes more knots.

I have to go to work here in an hour. I‚Äôm not even dreading it. I hope it rains, were in a tornado watch again, at least that means rain.

It started sprinkling out here a while ago but stopped after a minute.

I don‚Äôt want to go in. I don‚Äôt want to stay out here writing though.

I‚Äôll figure things out tonight. I think my sleep schedule fucked me up last night. No more staying up to midnight for me."
0,"27.05.19. Skipping entries
I can‚Äôt believe I forgot to write a post. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt skip any days. I even knew what I wanted to write about.

But I was so tired, I passed out at 7pm.

Whatever. It happens.

...

Anyways, here‚Äôs what I wanted to write about.

This morning, I woke up on my friend‚Äôs couch, where I‚Äôd crashed drunk and high the night before.

It was 4am, and standing in front of me was a middle-aged man wearing nothing but old underwear.

It was my friend‚Äôs dad.

He had wandered down in the middle of the night for a glass of water.

Instead, he found a young girl passed out on his couch.

I‚Äôm not sure which one of us was more surprised.

For a moment, we stared at each other, frozen.

Then he noticed his son sleeping soundly next to me.

And he said, ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù and introduced himself!

So I introduced myself, too.

And then we remembered we had both met before.

We laughed, and he told me I was welcome to stay and sleep as long as I wanted.

Then he wandered off in his white cotton briefs to get his glass of water and go back upstairs to bed.

And I fell back asleep on his couch.

It was one of the more interesting mornings I‚Äôve had."

PM

I‚Äôve been awake 13 hours

13 hours of my day.

There are 4 hours left of May 27th.

Do I dare become NOCTURNAL?

Do I dare become a night dweller? One of those mad, creatives that work by a dim combination of lamp and moonlight?

I want to be awake when the world sleeps. Then I‚Äôm the one in control. I‚Äôd have the power.

I‚Äôm lonely.

Truly alone.

I‚Äôm one person to my family. Another to my church, and a third to the world.

I love my worldly self. MYself.

I am me. And no one knows ME.

I don‚Äôt even quite know WHO I am. But I wish I had someone to share who I‚Äôve discovered myself to be with.

I want someone to hold, someone to hold me. I want to kiss somebody I love. I‚Äôve always hated the idea kissing‚Äî but for some reason now, it sounds so inviting.

I want to kiss someone, yes, but I want someone who knows me, and I, them. I want someone to hold me tight and look at me with eyes of understanding.

I want a boyfriend. Not a boyfriend, just someone. Someone that I love. I hate the word boyfriend. So cliche.

And I can‚Äôt make the same mistakes. I fucked up with Rob. I betrayed myself, my morals, what I believed, because I was a naive, horny teenager. But that was two years ago.

I‚Äôm a different person. And I‚Äôll be a different person in two years.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying.

I guess I‚Äôm just lonely. I want human connection. I want to be in the presence of someone, alone.

I want someone to cry with.

A friend?

A lover?

God‚Äî what am I saying?

This is so unlike me. I don‚Äôt give two shits about relationships.

But suddenly... I do?

Fuck fuck fuck. My brain is jello.

Today was long and longer. I woke up. L made French toast. Showered real fast. Drew the tree outside my window. Made a calendar. Spun around in my chair for a while.

Then I got up on a mission. I decided to go on a walk. A walk to finally figure out where F‚Äôs mom lives. He‚Äôs told me before, past the split in ‚Äî-st street.

He told me there was a sign I‚Äôd recognize on the garage.

So I ventured out. It was humid as fuck. I walked down past R‚Äôs house. Down near where I wanted to go. But I went left. I went left because I was scared, and because I wanted to come down that street from a different side.

I kept finding myself thinking, what if he was there? With his family? Spending Memorial Day with his mom?

I‚Äôm so obsessive.

I walked so far. By my old house. There were two people standing out in the yard looking up at the house. I passed old neighbors whose names I didn‚Äôt know, and rounded the corner to go down ‚Äîst street. My heart was racing and I didn‚Äôt know why.

Well I did know why. I passed one house, two houses, three, four, then five. The fifth house has an odd little sign on the garage above an oddly placed mailbox. I knew that sign by heart.

I tried not to stop and stare at the place. I‚Äôve seen this house a million times. I used to play and ride by bike down there by it. Imagine the thought, I might‚Äôve passed F visiting his mom 5 years before I ever knew of him.

I went back home and pondered this.

...

I really did live close to his mom. Less than a 5 minute walk.

Damn.

I want to cry, but I can‚Äôt. I can feel my PMS kicking in. Maybe it‚Äôs not PMS. I don‚Äôt keep track of my cycle.

TW: SH


I broke my clean streak last night. Just for a bit. Just a couple tiny cuts. Just enough to get that satisfaction from slicing my skin open. Just through the epidermis.

My scars are fading so fast. They may even become barely visible someday.

I want them to go, but they have given me so much identity this last half year. Jesus.

I just got thrown back to the first time I cut. Don‚Äôt remember why I even did it. I just remember thinking, I can stop.

I couldn‚Äôt stop. I still think I‚Äôve got the power to stop now, but I don‚Äôt.

I just want to watch my self inflicted incisions full up with blood, and then pick the scabs away.

My knife is under my bed. I could cut right now if I wanted. I don‚Äôt really want to, but I can. I can cut. I have the power.

I have the power to control me right now. I can choose.

But I don‚Äôt want to choose.

I need to take a shit."

i meant to post last night but getting late from work messed my mind up. work was irritating as usual.  i dont know what to write about since the same bullshit go down daily. i have a grocery manager who i used to like yells at me and is on my ass about things that i have nothing to do with and a superviser that is cool but been acting like a bitch and is on me about shit as well. i know how to do my job. i just wish they fuck off.   the night manager asked me if i wanted to work nights with him. i dont know if he was being serious but im considering it. he said its too many hours but fuck it, i need all the hours i can get. im tired of being a cashier. i get shitted on by almost everyone.

&#x200B;

i am officially on vacation. i feel like a bum. i havent had a whole week off from work since i was unemployed. it is bringing back memerories of feeling shitty and going on long walks in hopes of finding money.  ill read my depression management book  to feel better.

ugh work last night got me feeling aggravated this morning. i wish everyone would just do their fucking jobs and stop looking at me to do everything for them.  i wish they didnt bring back self checkout. there is not enough cashiers to run it and people are yelling at me and blaming me for shit that happens there. i am considering getting my i.t certification sooner than later. ill still get the associate degree. i just need to get the hell out of the shithole. the daily disrespect is not worth it. 5 years of being shitted on was enough."
0,"27.05.19. Lazy Sunday
It‚Äôs 12:03am, so I guess technically I skipped a day.

But whatever, it‚Äôs the same day until you sleep.

Today was pretty good.

I ‚Äústudied‚Äù all morning (read: stared into space with my books out).

It‚Äôs so fucking frustrating.

I hope they diagnose me with ADHD so I can get medicated. My life would be so much better if I could just fucking *think*.

When I got back, it was still warm and sunny, so I decided to go skateboarding with my brother.

He‚Äôs only 14, so he‚Äôs in that stage where he‚Äôs nervous about everything, but too embarrassed to admit it.

So when the weather‚Äôs nice, I like to take him out and make him do things that scare the shit out of him.

Builds character.

He‚Äôs too self-conscious to say no, which is the only reason he goes.

Plus, he‚Äôs 14 - he wants to be cool.

When we first got out, he was an absolute mess; over-apologizing and tripping over himself, arms flailing out as he jumped off his board in terror every time he moved or saw a car out of the corner of his eye.

But as he started getting comfortable, he completely transformed.

By the end, he was riding down the whole street without stopping. He even did turns and went over some (tiny) cracks!

But more importantly, his attitude completely changed.

Instead of apologizing and avoiding eye contact, he was trying things, laughing when he fell, even teasing me and calling himself a better skater - he told me I have a lot to learn from him.

He even said I should look up to him, now that he‚Äôs taller than me.

By like, half an inch!

It barely counts.

But I let him say what he wanted.

He was just having fun - deep down, he‚Äôs incredibly kind and sensitive.

But he‚Äôs also a 14-year-old boy, so he would be *beyond* mortified if I knew he‚Äôs not really an asshole.

Every time he said something good about himself, even if it was clearly meant as a joke, I agreed. Even if it just sounded like I was continuing the joke.

Because subconsciously, you could tell the words got to him, even if he didn‚Äôt realize I meant it.

Maybe only because he didn‚Äôt realize I meant it.

He wouldn‚Äôt have accepted any compliments if he knew I meant them. So I had to be sneaky about it.

By the time we headed home, he was beaming.

We could‚Äôve skated back in the dark - his grin would have lit up the whole street for us.

When we got home, I said: ‚ÄúThat was fun!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

From a 14-year-old boy??

That monosyllabic grunt says *everything*.

Then I went upstairs to my room to change.

I‚Äôm going out to a free stand-up comedy thing at some bar downtown tonight with my friends, so I have to wear something-not-sweatpants.

It‚Äôll be the first time in a while for me.

My housemates and I once tried to name each other‚Äôs styles. Mine was ‚ÄúBasement Casual‚Äù.

But today, I wore black leggings and a black t shirt.

Baby steps.

I felt kind of bad, because while I was changing in my room I heard the kids.

But I stayed in my room.

They have no idea I‚Äôm even here.

The plan happened so last-minute, only my mom and siblings know. And my dad, but he‚Äôs away.

So I went this whole weekend without seeing anyone else in the family.

It‚Äôs not that hard, even though we live together. The house is big enough to hold 15 people, and we all have different schedules.

I feel bad for not taking care of the kids.

Or even saying hi.

But fuck.

I just couldn‚Äôt.

I needed a weekend where I could just be 19 and not needed to take care of anyone except myself.

Things have been better for them lately, anyways, since the last time I went home. Not much better, but enough that my therapist probably wouldn‚Äôt legally have to report us anymore.

Anyways, they call me whenever they need something, so I know they‚Äôre ok.

When the kids were done eating dinner, I snuck out to go to a bar with my friends.

We saw a no-cover comedy night.

It was fucking HYSTERICAL.

My favourite act was this random old white guy, whose entire act was just him standing on stage being a random old white guy.

Like, he *was* the joke.

He basically just rambled about his kid skateboarding with no helmet, how he prefers plain shirts, and how he didn‚Äôt want to tell us his pet‚Äôs name because it made a good password. He even pulled out his reading glasses at one point.

I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt.

It‚Äôs one of those things where you can‚Äôt even explain the joke, because there‚Äôs nothing to explain.

You just have to experience it.

Or maybe I was just drunk.

When that was over, my buddies and I got burritos and then went to the park to smoke.

We got high on the swing set and then looked at the stars.

Later, I‚Äôm crashing on one of their couches. So we can stay out bar-hopping and getting high in parks as long as we want.

Now we‚Äôre wandering around, getting drunk and into trouble until we get bored, then getting high again.

It sounds so boring.

All the best nights do.

We‚Äôre so busy enjoying each other‚Äôs company that we don‚Äôt even need to be interesting.

It‚Äôs just a bunch of little moments that I‚Äôll cherish forever, even though I won‚Äôt even remember them.

Plus, we have a tradition of recording ourselves when we get high, so I don‚Äôt need to care about the details. I have hours of our conversations I can re-live whenever I feel like it.

I‚Äôve never listened to any of them.

I don‚Äôt need to.

The feeling stays with me, even as the details fade.

For me, for now, that‚Äôs enough.

Now we‚Äôre at a random pizza place.

We‚Äôre just sitting around doing nothing.

Some of us are on our phones (which is how I‚Äôm writing this). Some of us are eating pizza. Some of us are draped over empty tables or each other‚Äôs laps, totally zoned out in our own little worlds.

It‚Äôs the best.

I couldn‚Äôt tell you why.

But I wouldn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else right now."
0,"Day3 - How to ask for help?
I'm still alive

I'm not okay, but I don't want to die

I'm sick of realizing I did nothing on things that I've planned

I hate telling people I'm doing fine just to shut them up and stop

&#x200B;

I'm still not sure if I'm crazy or sane

I'm loosing sleep at night and so tired to face the day

I don't feel like moving

I'm tired of posting in the internet just for validation

Is expressing myself just another way to fish for attention?

&#x200B;

I hate not having a reason to try to look better

Anyway, all the people I talk to are considered strangers

If I sound sane and normal only when I am in the internet

Then I am so so glad that I hated myself

&#x200B;

I am not good in decisions

I struggle with emotions

I wouldn't be my own friend, I'm much of a burden

I feel the emptiness inside but I smile around people

A day without a fucked up thought is a miracle

&#x200B;

I know I'm fortunate enough than most people do

But I wish I'm also capable to to feel it too

I know I'm pretty good and have some skill sets

But I haven't been great to anything to be considered talented

&#x200B;

I wish this poem gets deeper

I wish the words rhyme better

I know 99 percent of people really won't mind

I think the idea of posting this makes me realize

it's useless cause reading this is a waste of time

&#x200B;

I know what's good or wrong

I wish I was more responsible with decisions

I wish I could reach out to people that are mentally stable

But if I did, I wouldn't waste their time on me 'cause I am disabled

&#x200B;

I feel alone

I know I'm not

I had so many people to talk to, but I have stopped

They didn't deserve the drama that even me don't understand

I couldn't bear to become a burden again

I'd rather stay silent than to have an awkward moment

&#x200B;

I should be happy in the moment

I am not when I reflect

I try things just to waste my time and get distracted

Cause if I get in touch with myself I am so self-destructive

&#x200B;

I don't want to hurt the people I love

So I bury my own self and vowed not to open up

Until horrible decisions dug up the coffin

And I made mistakes up to the point of no return

&#x200B;

I can't predict that things that I'll do, I am never sure

Just because you know you're color blind, doesn't mean you can see color

I can't face myself in the mirror, I feel sick of myself

If I'm disgusted of what's inside, how can I ask for help?"

Today took some pleasant, unexpected turns.

Got up. Went to church. Same old shabang.

I was in the car going home when Anna called me and asked if I wanted to go to Chipotle for lunch. I said sure.

A few mins later she picked me up and we ate at Chipotle.

We sat outside. It was so nice out. We decided to have a picnic later.

When we finished eating we went to her house and she worked on some stuff for work real fast and we decided to go downtown to the river market.

We spent forever trying to find parking and got lost. Some big Memorial Day event happening where we were gonna park. We ended up finding a spot by the river market after getting lost again.

I told my dad we were going somewhere else downtown.

We parked near this long bridge that goes over the train tracks and ends at the river edge. The last time I was here was two years ago. On our CC field trip with F. The first time I realized how fun our art class was.

A train went by and honked really loud and scared us half to death.

I was kind of sad. CC was cancelled this year. They sold the warehouse. Vicki moved away. CC at the warehouse was over forever.

I wonder if Vicki kept my rock sculpture?

Anyways, after I got sad remembering the past, we went back to her car and put on some sunscreen and walked to the market.

It was 3:00 and most of the vendors were gone besides the permanent ones.

We left and went to the grocery store and bought some fruit for a picnic. We went to the park and took some pics and ate a bunch of water melon and pineapple. My lips are raw and sore from the acidity of the pineapple, but it was so sweet.

I kind of hate myself. I said I wasn‚Äôt going to spend any money. I spent like 25 bucks today.

I‚Äôm an idioooot.

A tired idiot.

I‚Äôm gonna shower because my sister says I stink. I showered this morning. I‚Äôll just use body wash. Maybe I just need to change clothes.

I want to read. An escape before I get to work tomorrow. Get to work on being productive.

Which I know is more of a lifestyle thing, but still.

Today was so nice. But my brain can‚Äôt take in much more. Maybe I just need a shower and some wake up music.

I‚Äôm very backwards today.

Woke up and made some eggs.

Made a budget. And it turns out I really gotta penny pinch if that Santa Fe trip ends up being like 1,000$. Fucking plane ticket prices. I‚Äôm gonna have to take off less weekends this summer.

Shit.

I thought about taking on more hours of work but I really don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll find an alternative way of making money‚Äî or saving.

Work was work. Alex said gluten free lady said hi while I was on break. That woman is so sweet.

My manager gave me a dollar. That was cool. I lost a bet with Alex that we could not use our left arm for as long as possible. Whoever lost had to buy the other dinner.

I lost, but technically she should of. After 40 minutes my arm felt like it was gonna fall off from inactivity.

I bought her dinner. Bought myself an ice cream cone.

Got home and had some alone time.

I really should shower but I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll get up early.

I figure I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm not gonna spend 300$ at fuckin‚Äô art camp, right? They DO have a store, and we will probably eat out once or twice on the weekend. I can‚Äôt imagine me spending more than 150$ on supplies, and that‚Äôs pushing it.

Who knows. Maybe supplies were included with the price? God, I sure hope so. How nice would that be?! But I doubt it, the AI loves it‚Äôs money.

I‚Äôm really excited though. I‚Äôm really nervous my skills aren‚Äôt good enough. I need to draw more. I need to draw people more. I‚Äôm going to do a life drawing every day. I need to get better at figure drawing. Maybe I‚Äôll get my sister to help me sometimes.

I don‚Äôt wanna be the kid who is mediocre. I want to be the best. It‚Äôs selfish, but at least I‚Äôm honest with myself right?

But yeah. On top of that, I‚Äôve got fuckin‚Äô church camp from the 26th-30th next month. Don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. I feel like an alien at church sometimes. I didn‚Äôt think I strayed THAT far from their path, but damn.

Maybe I should read my bible. I don‚Äôt know.

Anyways, after fuckin‚Äô church camp, I‚Äôve got a week until I pack up and move to the local art college for three weeks. I‚Äôll have classes most of the day and it‚Äôs gonna be amazing. I‚Äôm still in disbelief that I‚Äôm able to go, and didn‚Äôt have to pay but 300$.

I hope I learn a lot of useful stuff. I really hope. I want to learn some skills to take back to the classroom in August.

Speaking of the classroom, I may have found a solution to my etching ground issue. I asked a printmaker on insta what ground they used, and they said something like ‚ÄúB.I.G. Ground.‚Äù

I‚Äôm gonna order that and give it a whirl, supposedly it‚Äôs non-toxic. I want to coat a plate, and go in to school in a few weeks and print. (If F is there and willing.)

He kept telling me he‚Äôd be in the classroom a lot during the summer, but he‚Äôs posted stuff on Facebook saying like, peace, room. 204 till August.

But he‚Äôs not actually leaving the room for two months right? He said he‚Äôd be back. Right? I don‚Äôt know anymore...

I miss him. It‚Äôs only been two days. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I want to prove to him I‚Äôm a good artist over summer. I want to be the best he‚Äôs ever had come though his class. This is my time to kick ass!

I‚Äôm gonna put on some music. Purple Pilgrims probably. Something quiet and dreamy.

So today I met up with my two best friends for the first time in about 6 months and by god did it feel like it, we went to a store before, grabbed snacks, went to the cinema, grabbed drinks and a bucket of popcorn from a coupon one of us had ; grabbed tickets for detective Pikachu. It was a good movie and there must've been at least 6 plot twists, finished up there and went to grab some MacDonald's, then to (after a few calls) stay at my house till 6, at which time they both left to me relaxing for the same evening and to bed and asleep hopefully soon."

It has been a wild day.

I've done some  things that I could not believe that I could do. I was hanging out with a friend, and our conversation got a little too deep that it hits me like I have never felt before.

I had some dark days in my life and I was not in a really good place. But, I managed to pull through. I had learned how to detach myself from emotions and to have a constant happy mood so my days will not be ruined. The pain and hurt on my chest magically disappeared. Doubts and anxiety do not visit me as often as before. I could now sleep at night without creating a false sense of loneliness, just for the sake of feeling lonely. But as a price to pay, I have never felt not so alive. It's like I am not living, but just not dying. It was like I have separated myself from feeling things. Like I have buried someone deep inside me and chose a new persona that vowed not to talk to the previous version of myself. All the good things that happen, this new persona is owning them. But all the bad stuffs, I am throwing it all to the person who I was before, let him suffer the worrying, the doubts, the anxieties, so I don't have to deal with it. And for the most part, it's worked. I have lived a ""happy"" and ""normal"" life.

I was not really aware of what I was going through until our conversation last night. Somehow, I felt like there was something inside me that I keep on denying, suppressing, running from. But that night, I felt him. He was clawing his way back to the surface. All the feelings, emotions, and selfish thought that I had threw into him for the past year, he puked it out and hit me like a train wreck. And, now, I am back at it again. The hole in my chest that I thought that I already patched up is now gaping again. The feeling of having a sharp scalpel being stab into my chest is back. I don't even have any reason to be sad. But since last night, I know deep inside, I am not happy.

On the contrary, I have never felt more alive since then. Is it weird??

Hello. It has been a few months since my last post.

I finally got my surgery last week. It was quite a thing to recover... I still have 5 weeks till I'm fully recovered though. Visited my gynecologist for a follow up so he cut my stitches out and showed me pics of my tumor... that tumor was a lot bigger than anyone expected including me. It looked chunky. I'm glad it was removed.

The first couple of days was a doozy to recover because it hurt but I was told to start walking around by day 3. I definitely felt like shit but painfully and slowly I walked around. And slowly and day by day I am getting better and better.

Today happens to be day 9 since my surgery. I am able to do a bit of air crunches (basically standing stretches while lifting one knee up and bringing my head down close to my knee and then returning bringing the knee back down and head back up) to help strengthen my pelvic floor again because it still feels odd down there, but it doesn't hurt to do it. Would have definitely hurt a few days ago though. Also walking doesn't hurt anymore either. I still can't run though, it would be too much but I will be able to eventually once I'm fully healed. Gotta work hard on recovering my muscle strength. I've also been eating foods with protein and also vitamin c foods.

So yeah I am doing good so far! Recovery was great and I am so happy to be tumor and cyst-free. The name of my procedure was a myomectomy and a cystectomy, but more emphasis on the myomectomy since they removed one of my ovaries and tubes that was replaced by the tumor. My gynecologist said I was a good case.

I struggled a lot in the past year so once this recovery is over I should be back to my normal life! üò≠"

today was okay and annoying.   my coworkers kept texting me about getting the schedule for them and i couldn't do it because i was not home and i sure as hell was not going up to my job on my day off so ill have to get it tomorrow. im anxious to know what days I'm working next week because i have to start working at the pool asap. this also means i won't be working with my cousin but i don't care because he is a pain in the ass. he wants me to go to some fucking babyshower my oldest neice is doing and its the same week as the picnic. plus she already had the baby so no use in going. I'll see her at the picnic. the babyshower is all white dress code and at a fancy hotel so definitely a hell no to that. i will not be requesting off for it so fuck that.  it just aggravated me because he makes it seem like the baby shower is so important but the picnic is and he just trying to get information out of me because he is nosy. i hate that shit.

i talked to my older brother whom i have not seen in years. we spent an hour conversating which was cool. i need to talk to my other siblings more.

so far i read one chapter of my depression book and it talks about techniques used to fight it. ill be looking forward to it.

my xbox and roku tv been having issues streaming and i don't know what the fuck is going on. the wifi is good on my phone but everything else is an issue. a good reset on the router is needed. ill do it later tonight.

with school starting back up and working two jobs, im cutting back on youtube and showtime and hulu. i wont have enough time for it so no need for distraction.


just want to get this off my chest. i am Wondering who really has my back. everyone so far been telling me they are looking out for me and yet they somehow used me. including my family. man I don't even know anymore because so far everyone been fucking snakes.  so far the only person to have my back is me. it is a neverending cycle. people used and manipulate me and i end up in hot water. this is a fucked up world man. one of the reasons why i am depressed. everyone lies and use one another.

my yoga mat came in. hooray I guess.

sorry if this is tmi but i feel horny tonight and will be going on Instagram for hotties.

i could use a bf in my corner. i need somebody."

I didn‚Äôt want to write anything right now, I‚Äôm completely exhausted.

But I‚Äôll force myself to, because it‚Äôs this kind of ritual I need to do to feel like I‚Äôve got a grip on my life.

Documentation of mind and life.

Anyways, to the point‚Äî

I woke up early, took a shower, made some tea and listened to a podcast or two in the living room watching the cars go by. I‚Äôve been really enjoying 99% invisible lately.

I paced around the house some, ate a leftover hash brown square still cold.

I worked on cleaning my room some more, and got utterly bored. I wanted to buy a desk for my room. A real, workspace with a real table. Not my crappy one from third grade.

So we got in the car and started driving to IKEA. Halfway there, my dad remembered he was going to have me drive, so he stopped in a parking lot and we switched seats.

I was super nervous until I actually started driving the car. It‚Äôs a lot easier than I think every time. I drove all the way to IKEA, even parked.

I bought my desk, and shelves. Finally.

I drove us home. Parked in the garage and everything.

I made some Mexican rice for lunch with a cheese stick.

Then I put together my table in the living room, and moved it into my room and cleaned a bit more.

Later I‚Äôd given up and dad came by and helped me clean. The only reason my motivation came back was me trying to pick up bloody toilet paper sheets before he saw them. I think he picked up a pencil sharpener blade, but didn‚Äôt suspect a thing.

That‚Äôs the thing about cutting my legs. To people who don‚Äôt know anything about SH other than people sometimes cut their wrists, assume people only cut their wrists.

Anyways. I‚Äôm done cutting. I‚Äôm sick of that shit. I had urges to the other day but I shut them down. I was only cutting because it was a ritual for me. Just an act I was addicted to. But I‚Äôve replaced cutting with healing. I rub lemon balm over my scars instead of opening up my skin.

So we cleaned some more until my floor was empty. By this time I had to get ready for work.

I trained a new girl at work. Chloe. She seems nice enough. It started to thunderstorm really bad. My phone was dead so I couldn‚Äôt check radar. One customer said we were in a tornado watch.

When I got home my dad had cleaned my floor with his fancy cleaner. It was still thunder storming bad and I just cleaned my desk some more and organized a bit.

Then we went into a tornado warning. Radar looked bad, rotation to the south of us. We were on the outside of the warning box, but still super close. Something seemed to be developing right over top of us. There were sirens. We went downstairs just in case.

That‚Äôs the thing about us. Tornadoes don‚Äôt phase us whatsoever. It‚Äôs just like, ‚Äúugh, so I have to go downstairs? It‚Äôs not even that close!‚Äù

We stayed downstairs maybe 5 mins then we went back upstairs. I went back to my room and cleaned some more.

Dad helped me hang up my shelves for a while and we realized we need a different anchor so he will get that in the morning. I‚Äôm bummed it can‚Äôt be finished tonight, but I‚Äôm kind of exhausted.

I wish I weren‚Äôt so tired.

I have to work all day tomorrow. Great.

I need the money though. I gotta stop spending what little I get from my dinky job.

I‚Äôm just gonna lay here listening to another podcast, Nocturne. I‚Äôll watch the lighting until I pass out.‚Äô

I‚Äôm ready for summer."

These feelings, I don't know, where they came from and why it hurts so much. Maybe, I should have known. This has been going on since 2014, maybe sooner. I can't remember. I don't want to remember.

I sometimes laughed at people speaking about gender dysphoria on the internet. I simply couldn't imagine it, especially with the very young ones. Had I known, how horrible it was - gods, I wish I could take it back. Maybe I bottled up these feelings for a bit too long and I couldn't cope with being confronted with it.

I just... I don't want to be a girl anymore. I mean, I like the aesthetic. I like, how girls look. I like, how I look. But it's not me. How often have I cried these past years because I am a girl?

I like gay stuff. Fanfictions, fanart, movies, real-life couples, whatever. It might be cringy, but I like it. Over the years, I started to yearn for those types of relationships. I simply enjoy dudes fucking, so what? Men like lesbians, too, it's not too weird, right? It brought me a lot of joy.

Not anymore, though. Now, every time I read these stories or watch that damned porn, I start crying. I start crying because I can't have that. I can't have a dick and stick it in someone. I can't be a twink or a bear or whatever. I'm doomed to be me and I hate it. I can't even fathom to imagine letting a man touch me now. I don't want to sleep with anyone like this. With this body - it's revolting.

And I don't want to get T and let myself be transformed. *It's not real. It's unnatural.* My body doesn't deserve to be punished. It's a perfectly fine, girl body. It hasn't done me any wrong.

It's not meant to be.

I try to accept that, but I can't stop crying. I'm telling myself this is just some kind of fetish. That this doesn't mean anything. I'm not trans. But it *hurts*.

Maybe in my next life... maybe I'll be lucky then. Perhaps I'll be some cute, little twink. But, for now, it's not meant to be. I'm not meant to be granted every wish. Frankly, I don't deserve it anyway. How many people have I hurt in my life? This is the payback. An eternal blemish, which will stick to me in this life.

Maybe I'll manage to like this girl existence, too. Somehow. And if not... well, then I'll stay alone. I'd rather be alone than hurt some poor soul because I'm repulsed by my own gender. He doesn't deserve that, whoever he'll be.

I hope this will get better, maybe I'll forget about this enterprise."

I went home to visit this weekend.

My mom was supposed to pick me up from the station, but at the last minute said she was busy, and how would I feel about getting myself home?

I texted back: *I don‚Äôt mind.*

This happens every time. I had already bought my subway tickets.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm desperate to spend time alone in a car getting grilled by my mom, anyways.

I let myself in when I got home.

My mom was sitting at the computer playing this online card game she‚Äôs obsessed with. It‚Äôs some virtual gambling thing.

She came over to greet me.

‚ÄúI could‚Äôve picked you up, you know.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mind the subway.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, I could have. If you wanted me to, I would.‚Äù

Then she waited.

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine to take the subway.‚Äù

Satisfied, she nodded.

Then she made a face.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pimple.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. It looks like herpes. Welcome home, baby!‚Äù

...

Update:

Apparently, my dad‚Äôs in Europe for the weekend.

He said hopefully he‚Äôll be around next time I go home.

He always says that."

I wasn't feeling depressed today which is good. work was okay except for the last customer that was too confusing about her bill. she was trying to figure out how much she has to pay even though it says so on the screen. it frustrated me and the other customers in line greatly. it amazes me how stupid people can be.


i talked to two of my coworkers about a supervisor who been degrading me and making me feel like shit. at first i thought it was out of love but then it was out of pure shittiness. my coworka carla witnessed it the other day and she couldn't believe it. she said if it happens again she will say something.  the supervisor name is carrie and she been training to be a manager. my department manager was there when it happened and she didn't say a thing. it just shows how much she cares about her employees. my other coworker donna couldn't believe it either and told me to call the union. i love how donna and carla looks out for me. i feel loved.  i definitely will consider calling the union because i work too hard just to be degraded like that.

soon i will be starting my summer job at the community pool. i don't want to but i have to.  i have figure out how to balance two jobs and go to school online. this summer will kick my ass for sure so i will need lots of hail Mary on this one.

I haven't read my depression book yet. i got distracted by so much shit. i Really need to.

i would like to say thank you to everyone that commented their concerns on my posts. i really appreciate it."

I did a *lot* of googling about PTSD.

It said it doesn‚Äôt go away on its own. You have to face it, or your symptoms just keep getting worse.

Sounds like a fucking death sentence.

It‚Äôs so unfair.

I didn‚Äôt ask for any of this.

I just want to be able to be happy without this fucking cloud over my head.

Why‚Äôd all this shit have to happen to me?

I had more than enough shit to begin with.

It said only 25% of people develop PTSD. 1 in 4 people‚Äôs brains just can‚Äôt handle it.

That number was a lot lower than I thought it would be. 75% of people are *fine* after something bad happens? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I‚Äôve never felt so pathetic in my entire life.

Not even when I was raped.

It said if something bad has happened before, it can ‚Äúre-traumatize‚Äù you.

So basically what that means is I‚Äôm not just traumatized from the whole ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù situation.

I‚Äôm also re-traumatized from every time I‚Äôve ever felt that helpless and alone.

Since St. Patty‚Äôs, I‚Äôve been endlessly going over almost *my entire life*.

Fuck.

Not to mention all the new memories that resurfaced. Those were fun to flashback to.

*Fuck*.

I thought I was getting better.

A lot of the really intense feelings have dulled. But... so have all the rest of them. It makes me feel empty inside. And disconnected.

Is that why I can‚Äôt be happy?

My counsellor asked me if I still think about it a lot and I said no. So she said she‚Äôll never bring it up again, and from now on we can just focus on the future and symptom management.

And I was so relieved.

I thought that meant I was getting better.

And it‚Äôs true- I don‚Äôt obsess over the details of what happened all the time anymore.

I haven‚Äôt had a flashback in ages.

I can leave the house without constantly spinning in every direction, scanning for attackers and feeling like something bad will happen any moment now. I only do that in big crowds now, or when I feel unsafe.

And most of the time, when I start thinking about it, I can make myself stop.

But then I took that survey at the psycho-assessment place and learned there‚Äôs a difference between *choosing* not to think about something versus just not thinking about it.

And I am definitely choosing not to think about it.

Did I make a mistake when I told my counsellor I had processed it enough?

I *really* don‚Äôt want to get back into it.

I just got out of it!

My counsellor asked me what I would change about my life and I couldn‚Äôt think of anything.

On paper, things seem pretty great right now.

But I can‚Äôt enjoy any of it for very long. I keep having all these racing thoughts or crazy anxiety or I just get so numb and empty I don‚Äôt even care about anything anymore.

But aren‚Äôt those just symptoms now? That I can reduce with symptom management?

Plus, maybe I‚Äôm just self-sabotaging because I secretly don‚Äôt *want* to be happy. That sounds pretty fucked up, but I read about that on the internet, too.

What if I fucked up because I‚Äôm too avoidant, and now I‚Äôll never be able to be happy, because I won‚Äôt be able to move on? But I DON‚ÄôT want to talk about it. I don‚Äôt want to go back down that rabbit hole. I don‚Äôt think I could handle it.

It‚Äôs so fucking unfair.

I really do want to get better.

But I don‚Äôt even know what better means, or what I need to do to get there.

But my counsellor says she can only help me get there if I tell her what better means to me.

But I don‚Äôt know!

And even if I did know, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to say it.

My old counsellor gave me that stupid feeling wheel and told me I needed to name my feelings. But we never got around to the specifics of how or what that even means, and then I switched counsellors.

Lately, she‚Äôs been on my mind a lot.

Does that mean she ‚Äúre-traumatized‚Äù me too? Or am I just obsessive? Why can‚Äôt I shut my mind off?

Maybe my counsellor was right.

Maybe I‚Äôm just not ready.

How do you know when you‚Äôre ready?

What if I‚Äôm never ready?

Am I just doomed to be miserable forever?

I feel really hopeless.

I really, really, really, *really* hope the assessment lady doesn‚Äôt diagnose me with PTSD.

Because if she does then I‚Äôll have to think about all this for real instead of just as a hypothetical. And I‚Äôll probably have to tell my counsellor, too.

And I *just* I got moved down to once every two weeks.

That‚Äôs *progress*.

That‚Äôs what I was hoping for this whole time!

I thought it meant I was getting better. That I don‚Äôt have PTSD. That I‚Äôm capable of moving on.

I don‚Äôt want to undo all that!

And I feel like if I bring this up she‚Äôs just gonna think I‚Äôm making up problems for attention so I can go back more often. Because this opens up a whole bunch of problems.

But I don‚Äôt *want* to go back more often!

I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in therapy forever.

I don‚Äôt even like going now!

But what if I do, and I‚Äôm just lying to myself by thinking that I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm avoidant or in denial?

All this stupid psychobabble is getting in my head.

I just don‚Äôt want to be such an attention whore.

Here are some symptoms of PTSD:
- Inability to focus
- Racing thoughts
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Emotional dysregulation
- Poor impulse control/reckless decision making
- Substance abuse issues
- Low self-esteem

I have all those symptoms, and then some. Honestly, reading the descriptions of either diagnosis makes me feel a little too exposed for my liking.

If I get diagnosed with ADHD, I can take medication and get extra support at school and my problems will practically vanish overnight, from what I‚Äôve heard.

If I have PTSD, things get a whole lot more complicated. From what I‚Äôve read online, it‚Äôs essentially a life full of pain and suffering.

I gave up trying to study for my math test after sitting in the library doing nothing for four and a half hours, struggling to focus through these racing thoughts.

But what‚Äôs causing them?

I wish I knew.

I feel like it‚Äôs ADHD. I‚Äôve been like this forever.

But... I‚Äôve gotten a lot worse this past year.

A lot of shit got stirred up.

My last day of assessment is tomorrow. I just got the reminder email. Then they‚Äôll finally, officially diagnose me, if I have anything (‚Äúif‚Äù, lol!).

But all bets are off on what with.

The psychologist said I‚Äôm ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù.

I know which diagnosis I‚Äôm hoping for.

There‚Äôs a full-blown thunderstorm outside right now, but when the lightning stops, I‚Äôm going out to get high.

Fuck this."

Yesterday I stayed late again with F. The only notable thing I‚Äôll mention is that we looked up some more stuff for the Santa Fe trip.

We looked at hotels and compared prices and he even called one to see if they had a group rate. We even dropped the idea of driving in a van for 12 hours to flying there in a plane.

We would get there in a fourth of the time, and we wouldn‚Äôt have to take off Thursday AND Friday.

It‚Äôs almost a reality.

Anyways. That happened.

But today was the last day of school. The last day before summer. The last day I‚Äôd see F for two and a half months unless I see him over the summer. He said he‚Äôd come to my art camp exhibition. He also said I could come in to use the classroom later.

Today was fast. I‚Äôd only be leaving now on a normal day. I went to 6th hour first thing in the morning and half assed my final. It was bad. And F knew it. I just looked at the comments on it and half were grammar errors, the other just the result of me quickly researching and writing a short essay.

It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not worried. He knows I half assed it. That‚Äôs all that matters. He knows it‚Äôs not my best self.

We tried some photo polymer plates that didn‚Äôt end up working. Later class ended and I asked to stay for seminar because I was originally going to ride the bus.

And I sat there for a while and Athena came in with some knitting project and some other kid and was talking. I was silent. F was silent. Not much was happening and the silence was too awkward.

During class I‚Äôd written him a note. Thanking him for an amazing school year. He went into the other room and I got up, packed my stuff up, set the note on his podium, and went into the other room to say bye.

The goodbye felt rushed. And I‚Äôm sorry it was. He said again he‚Äôd be there during the summer sometimes and if I wanted to work on stuff it‚Äôd be okay. We said bye and said to have a good summer. I said you too. And I was okay. I was okay.

I‚Äôd been stressing about that moment for months and months and months. And it was not a sad goodbye, nor a happy goodbye. And I think I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt. Obviously no one likes a sad goodbye, but a happy goodbye would mean I‚Äôd miss him too much.

I got home. Listened to some music, put on a podcast, and started cleaning my room. I opened my window and after an hour got bored of cleaning and went to go sit outside and soak up some sun since it was so cool out.

I put on some sunscreen and I‚Äôm just able to sit here thinking and enjoying things.

I will not waste this summer.

This will be the most productive time of my life yet. This will be a summer of learning, growth, and a big, huge, introverted vacation from people.

I am beyond excited and completely content.

I‚Äôm going to get up by 8 every day. I‚Äôm going to read every day. I‚Äôm going to draw every day for multiple hours. I‚Äôm going to be outside for as much as my body will tolerate. I‚Äôll get over my fear of bugs.

Anyways. It‚Äôs less sunny now.

I hope my freckles come back.

I want to be a little more tan.

I want to come out of this a little more wise.

Anyways. I should go in to charge my phone.

It‚Äôs not too humid surprisingly. And there‚Äôs a nice little cool breeze blowing through my bedroom window.

I just got interrupted by my whole family barging into my room to give me a couple of birthday cards from the fam.

I don‚Äôt like them being in my room... I need to clean.

Anyways, I was saying I can‚Äôt help but imagine F driving by. I mean‚Äî he must‚Äôve been looking, right? I do post a lot of videos on my Instagram story out my window at the street/church across from me. So if you know the area it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to find.

I just‚Äî I don‚Äôt know.

I do the exact same thing to him. He gave me a pamphlet from the local art college that had his address on the back. Being a curious, creepy fuck like I am, I looked it up. Turns out I practically pass it every day on the way to school or church. He lives in a nicer house than I thought he did. I don‚Äôt think he family is poor by any means, his mom lives in a nice house I know now.

I looked it up on google earth, it‚Äôs beautiful, with cool terra-cotta roofing. There‚Äôs even a courtyard in the middle with a small pool.

Anyways. Stalking aside, it was a good day. I‚Äôm still out-of-my-mind-excited for our potential Santa Fe trip. ‚Äîjust a random thought. I can‚Äôt stop day dreaming of it.

Speaking of dreams. I did dream last night. I feel like I‚Äôve got a superpower where I can control whether I dream or not.

It was weird and there was one scene where I was in some sort of craft store and F was there and he was talking to me about his son or something and his son had a girlfriend or something like that. The only other part I remember this weird wooden soldier dude who moved like a weeping angel. It was trying to kill me.

So I had a nightmare I guess. I wasn‚Äôt scared when I woke up, but I was scared in the dream.

Ehh, my diary isn‚Äôt even a diary, it‚Äôs just like a random jumble of my thoughts. Sometimes I describe what happens in my day but rarely in sequence.

Maybe I‚Äôll do that today like I used to. I started writing in my diary in either October or November on an alt account. Then I stopped for a long time and picked back up in March.

So much has changed. I really want to go back and read those old ones now.

But I‚Äôll wait to do that.

...

Today was Tuesday.

I had a really hard time getting out of bed this morning. I realized I didn‚Äôt shower, and that I had my math final first thing when school starts.

But the real reason I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed was because I wouldn‚Äôt see F at any point today because of the schedule for finals.

I put my hair up in a bun to hide how gross it looked. Don‚Äôt know it that helped much anyways. I also realized I still hadn‚Äôt printed out my fitness log.

I realized I would see him in the cafeteria briefly and that gave me enough hope to get up and dressed. I just wore some black jeans, sandals, and that stupid sweatshirt I got from Portland. It was comfortable at least.

It was still raining when I left so I brought an umbrella. That stupid broken one I‚Äôve had since I was a kid. I really need a nice umbrella, but I don‚Äôt want to pay for it.

I got to school, went to the cafeteria, passed F without a word and sat down like I do every morning. Soon Clara came in and sat next to me. Suddenly we‚Äôre friends. Like, I never talked to her when the seniors were still here, but she‚Äôs super chill. She helped me with logarithms a bit.

I left the cafeteria mad at the day to come. I took my math final. And I failed. I got a 43%. I didn‚Äôt realize this till later though.

Went to third hour, turned in my fitness log and a forged parent signature, and worked on a packing list for art camp. I need to buy a lot of stuff it turns out.

Went to fourth hour. I was kind of bummed that I wouldn‚Äôt even run into F in the cafeteria because he had a different floor for lunch. I checked my email while Mr. G was watching us while S was gone.

I checked my grades and I failed. I failed my math final. I failed second semester of the lower level algebra 2. I failed a class for the first time in my life.

But I‚Äôm not really fazed. I knew I was going to fail. But I was kind of worried what dad would say. He texted me later and was like, I failed my Junior year of math too, so I can‚Äôt really say anything.

But this means I‚Äôll have to take math next year so I went down to my counselor to bring her that green paper and talk to her about it. She said I‚Äôd only have to take a semester of consumer math. No biggie.

I went to lunch soon after that. I was gonna sit alone in the art hall, but I sat with Alex inside the cafeteria. I hadn‚Äôt really sat in there for lunch in a long time. He‚Äôs a good friend. One of the longest ones I‚Äôve had throughout my schooling years post- Rtn.

I had this grand idea on how I could have an excuse to talk to/see F today. Our last period of the day was a 55 min seminar. Most people had left already. We sat together goofing off outside his class. I waited outside until he went into his room. He looked at us, but I didn‚Äôt look at him. Later I went in to get a pass.

I asked if we could travel during seminar and he was confused, he didn‚Äôt know we even had a seminar. Leave it to F for not knowing the schedule.

He said sure and wrote me a pass. He said I was more than welcome to come hang out. He also said I didn‚Äôt have to sit out in the hall, but I said I was fine, I didn‚Äôt want to be the only one talking in his quiet class.

I went to my 5th hour. I was the only one who came. Mrs. H was having a meeting with some PTSA people.

And I went down to F‚Äôs room. I was like, ‚Äúman, no one is here either.‚Äù We didn‚Äôt talk much at all. I just made a little calendar in my notebook and messed around with my laptop. Oh, and Mrs. H said I could keep my computer over the summer. She put in a special request.

But we just sat in silence. Listening to his music on full blast. Alex C came by later and said hi. I‚Äôm gonna miss her next year.

Anyways, nothing notable was said, except he asked if I listened to Nirvana and I said not really. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like Nirvana, I just haven‚Äôt listened to them yet. Same goes for all of his other music. I love his music taste. I just am a bit of an inexperienced music baby.

Like a minute before school was out, I asked about the final for art. I asked if it was on classroom, and he said it‚Äôs been on there for a few weeks lol. He was like, you need to get on that! I said I would. Then I made some snarky remark about how much I hate finals and then I said he said bye and I left.

Went home. Went to work. Now I‚Äôm here.

Woo hoo.

While writing this I just wondered if I should do my power project. Colleges look at my grades, and especially my art grades. It would do me good to have a good grade in art. If I turned this in and my final I‚Äôd probably have a 95 in the class.

I just don‚Äôt know WHAT to make.

I‚Äôll think about it tonight. I‚Äôll draw in my head. I‚Äôll figure out technicalities tomorrow.

I‚Äôll have to also do my art final tomorrow.

Jeez this was long. I‚Äôm gonna go do something else."
0,"21.05.19. What‚Äôs the opposite of wise?
People often tell me I‚Äôm wise.

It happens all the time. Has my whole life.

My friends tell me. My teachers have told me. Hell, even my parents have told me that I‚Äôm occasionally insightful.

(Usually with them, it‚Äôs long after the fact, of course.)

But I don‚Äôt think I hear it more often than I do on the internet.

Because, on the internet, everything has the potential to be ignored.

So when my thoughts get a reaction, good or bad, I know it‚Äôs genuine.

And when they don‚Äôt, I know it‚Äôs not personal.

So I tend to speak up more on the internet.

Instead of just thinking my thoughts in my head, I share them. Just... put them out there, since there‚Äôs no pressure. Nobody‚Äôs listening. That‚Äôs not the point.

Honestly, it‚Äôs hardly any different from thinking inside my head. If anything, typing my thoughts out makes them better.

Makes me stay clear and to the point.

(I have a tendency to spiral. Writing helps, even if only because eventually my hands get tired.)

The only difference with putting my thoughts on the internet instead of just having them in my head is that I‚Äôve shared them.

So all of a sudden, I‚Äôve found myself getting a lot of feedback, more than I‚Äôve ever gotten before.

Feedback from *other people*.

To *me*.

On my *thoughts*.

*My* thoughts!

And here‚Äôs the crazy part: their feedback is positive!

Not all the time. That would be stupid. But without a doubt, the majority of the feedback I get is good.

On my *thoughts*!

What the fuck?

People are *listening* to me.

What the fuck??

And not only that - they *like* me, too!

What the *fuck*???

A lot of the feedback I get is that I‚Äôm wise.

I truly, to my core, cannot believe that people value the things I say. That they *want* to take my advice.

But it‚Äôs happened enough times now that I‚Äôd be a hypocrite if I didn‚Äôt admit that maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Maybe I should believe it.

But that‚Äôs fucking terrifying.

I don‚Äôt *feel* wise.

Wise people are Buddhist monks who sit and smile and don‚Äôt speak for 45 years, and when they finally do they get a Nobel Peace Prize for what they have to say.

Wise people are wrinkly old grandparents who close their eyes and lean back in their leather armchair, sighing softly before they start telling their stories.

Wise people have already been through life, and come out stronger. That‚Äôs how they got wise.

But I‚Äôm the opposite of that. I‚Äôm not old - I‚Äôm still a teenager!

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about.

I haven‚Äôt come out stronger.

I‚Äôm not even finished yet.

I‚Äôm still right in the thick of it.

Why the fuck are people listening to me?

They shouldn‚Äôt be doing that!

But they do.

And they don‚Äôt care how I feel about it.

Nobody‚Äôs listening to me because they think they should, or because I‚Äôve tricked them into it.

No one is listening to me because they have to.

They‚Äôre just listening because they want to.

It has nothing to do with who I am at all.

They just like what I have to say.

It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

If I was wise, it would make sense.

What‚Äôs the opposite of wise? That‚Äôs what I feel like."

I don't feel like writing anything yesterday.
Well, some weird things happened yeaterday. Before going to my institute I opened my old box full of dirt for old past papers. I was not sure for its existence there but thankfully I got it.

It's kinda booklet I opened it and flip some pages and I got myself again in my past.

I have been running so far from my past and it finds me from one way or another. I found her name there (She used to write her name on my books) and nostalgia hits me really hard . I erased her name felt like I can erase or undo her from my past.

Went to my institute took my class and hot back home ... Then slept for 5 hours .In evening I got a text from someone unknown she asked me for dinner out. I asked her who is she said she was in my class way back but I was unsure how is this possible my life is so fucked up. Then she said because 'she texted the wrong guy' then I felt like me again . Well, that was a static day..

....

Today, was a calm day with some hide and seek but went well."

Hey, I‚Äôm Null.

I decided to make a throwaway account where I just do this. Make diary entries on reddit for the world to see,
It‚Äôs weird. Because I can literally write anything, but it‚Äôs not private.

Well I mean it is, particularly. I‚Äôm behind a screen, and you get to sit and read what my day was, how I feel.
It‚Äôs kinda like a counselor, a therapist? I don‚Äôt really know.

All I really know is that life‚Äôs weird right now, probably not as bad as others. But it‚Äôs probably declined a lot in my perspective of my life in the past two months.

I‚Äôve just became distant, no one wants to really talk to me and I‚Äôm becoming meaner. I see it but I don‚Äôt really wanna stop it.
I‚Äôm exhausted and I just want to be out for summer, I think I might‚Äôve burnt myself out a bit.

My friends are becoming more distant.
Miki is being a bossy-bitch like always. Getting snappy at a game of cards, then she just moved tables and I wasn‚Äôt even invited into the same card game I was playing exactly a second ago.

Like what the hell Miki? I know you‚Äôre going into homeschooling but get your head out of your ass and actually be considerate you cactus with spikes so big and long they just touch to tip of the Canadian border.

I also think one of my teachers is becoming concerned for my mental health a bit, wouldn‚Äôt blame them but I‚Äôm fine mentally. Just angry I guess.

I don‚Äôt know, what‚Äôs wrong with me guys?
I just want to know what I‚Äôm doing wrong so I‚Äôm not miserable for gods sake."
0,"20.05.19. Calling home
My mom called me the other day. She got a survey in the mail about my psychological testing.

She said: ‚ÄúYou know, sometimes you do research about things you find on the internet and you convince yourself you have all these symptoms you maybe don‚Äôt have.‚Äù

So I said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt research the things, I research the symptoms that I have and it leads me to the things that explain the symptoms. And I‚Äôm not convincing myself of anything, I‚Äôm getting tested by a professional. That‚Äôs what the survey‚Äôs for. Just fill it out honestly and we‚Äôll see if or what I have.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm just saying. You‚Äôre not *learning disabled*. Sometimes you just make stuff up.‚Äù

So I said: ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll find out. Why did you call me?‚Äù

And she said: ‚ÄúI wanted your help answering these questions. Some of them are hard.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not supposed to answer them, you are. It prevents me from being able to make stuff up, so we can get a clearer picture of what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a learning disability.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThen put down that you haven‚Äôt seen me display any of the symptoms they‚Äôre asking about.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúBut you have a lot of these.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThen put down that you‚Äôve seen them.‚Äù

And she said: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not that simple! You make stuff up! These questions are *hard*, you know? Some of it really sounds like you, but some of it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúJust answer honestly. I‚Äôm allowed to have some of the symptoms and not others. I‚Äôm definitely not the most severe case they‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

(Although, the psychologist did say I was ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù. Which is *not* what you want to hear from a psychologist. But that‚Äôs another story.)

She said: ‚ÄúLike this one here: frequently gets overexcited or boisterous during fun activities. I‚Äôve never seen you get boisterous or excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI agree with that. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever seen me during fun activities. We don‚Äôt usually do that kind of stuff together.‚Äù

And we both kind of went quiet for a moment.

Then she said: ‚ÄúYes we do! You make stuff up. You just don‚Äôt get excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI get excited. Just not much around you, I guess. But if you don‚Äôt see it, put down that you don‚Äôt see it. You‚Äôre supposed to answer it honestly. Don‚Äôt want me making stuff up, right?‚Äù

Although, they were *her* survey answers, not mine. I already filled one out.

Still, better to just take the blame.

Makes it go faster.

She said: ‚ÄúFine. But when do you get excited?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Whenever I‚Äôm enjoying myself. Same as everyone else, probably.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen you get excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù"

Second part.

Went out to dinner at JS with the grandparents. I ate a lot of really good food and I‚Äôll probably have the rest for dinner tomorrow or Wednesday.

I got a gift card from dad, and a gift card to Barnes and noble from grandma.

Grandma also got me a fucking electric razor‚Äî for shaving legs.

You‚Äôve GOT to be kidding me. My dad got me one last year too. And I almost got out for Christmas the year before last but I think it didn‚Äôt work.

Do they think I‚Äôve got hairy legs or something? They claim that‚Äôs not the case. They say it was a coincidence.

I‚Äôm kind of mad, but I don‚Äôt care because the gift cards were a blessing. I can finally buy that desk and make art over the summer.

Another thing I‚Äôve learned lately. Printmaking is a fucking expensive art. Plates alone make me broke, but now I‚Äôve gotta get ink, a hard ground, proper tools, and all this shit?????

I just don‚Äôt know if I can afford to make this type of art right now. I‚Äôll have to figure something out though. I want to prove I can do drypoint etchings. Maybe I just won‚Äôt do prints as my concentration. Just a few good ones in my breadth section. I can even use the plates I‚Äôve already bought if I use them wisely.

This summer is about saving money, and only buying what I need.

I need to save my money for camp, and for our trip to Santa Fe, and a car, and college. I was talking about it very vaguely in the car on the way to dinner. My sister mentioned OH yeah that trip dad probably won‚Äôt let you go on. And I said, why wouldn‚Äôt he let me go??

She‚Äôs fucking annoying as shit. I hate her sometimes.

But I can‚Äôt be mad.

...

I‚Äôve been reading on how to heal my scars. I don‚Äôt really want to go out and buy a scar healing cream because I‚Äôm trying to save $$.

I would if that‚Äôs my only option, but I read online that Burt‚Äôs bees hand salve can help heal scars. I‚Äôve got a little tub of that stuff and it‚Äôs THE SHIT. That stuff is SO moisturizing, and its all natural.

I rubbed some on my legs tonight. It‚Äôs going to be tough work healing that many scars. Why the fuck did I have to butcher my entire thighs.

I keep having this dream where I‚Äôm on the Santa Fe trip with the advanced placement art group with F.

And I‚Äôm at a point where my scars have faded enough to look older, and I‚Äôm comfortable wearing actual women‚Äôs shorts. And if someone questions me, I just give them a simple, ‚ÄúI did some stuff to myself I wasn‚Äôt proud of, but I‚Äôve moved past that now.‚Äù

And life is well and I‚Äôm so confident.

My other dream is where we‚Äôre at the hotel and we realize it has a pool. Later in the evening when we have ample time to do something, we all decide to go down to the pool.

I‚Äôm in my one piece swimsuit, but with my long, denim shorts on. Everyone is having a good time in the pool and I‚Äôm just sitting in a chair on the side.

In my dream, F comes down to join us by the pool because his job is to supervise us haha. I‚Äôm sitting alone and he walks over near me.

He says something like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not swimming??‚Äù

And I say something like. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

Then he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt swim?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo‚Äîno. I just‚Äî my legs, you know?‚Äù And I give him these big sad eyes.

And suddenly he understand, and says something like, ‚ÄúOh. You know it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I don‚Äôt think people are going to think of you worse if they know. You shouldn‚Äôt have to miss out on fun things like swimming.‚Äù

What he said in the dream was much shorter I think, but all I know is it filled me with so much courage. Someone in the pool calls to me later and I take off my shorts and get into the pool. No one really notices except for F, and if someone does, they don‚Äôt say a word or look at me any weirder.

I‚Äôm gonna go to bed right now so I will dream tonight.

I miss my mom on this day.

First birthday without her.

The last thing I remember hearing from her was a voicemail singing happy birthday to me.

But I lost that voicemail when my phone broke.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever hear her voice again."

Today is my birthday. I‚Äôm 17!

I woke up and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was my birthday. It just felt like the last Monday of the school year.

I got up, got dressed. But I was in a good mood.

I got a 100% on my history final which raised my grade to a D. I‚Äôm passing now! Thank god.

I didn‚Äôt do jack shit in math. I need to get a 60% or above to pass the class.

I need to remember to print out the fitness form for tomorrow for 3rd hour.

In 5th hour. Mrs. H bought us chipotle. She asked me if I could run down to the office to pick it up from the delivery person. So I did.

I got to the office and F was sitting in a chair talking to the receptionist. I was kind of confused, he was the last person I expected to see. F asked if I was leaving, he said he thought I was gone today. I was confused why he would think that because I didn‚Äôt have any of his earlier classes. Maybe he just didn‚Äôt see me at lunch I guess. He said happy birthday, and I said thanks. I explained that I was waiting to pick up Mrs. H‚Äôs chipotle.

I was happy to see him. I just sat in the chair opposite with my back to him holding Mrs. H‚Äôs phone in case the deliverer called. Sure enough they did, and I went outside to get it from her. She was super nice despite me being a delivery idiot.

I walked back in carrying the bag. I told F I brought cake for class and that it was in my locker.

So I went back upstairs, ate my burrito real fast, said bye and thanks to Mrs. H, and went down to art. I grabbed the lemon cake from my locker and went into class. There was some random lady with a visitor sticker talking to F. I offered them both some cake. They both had some.

She was SO NICE! I gathered that she was going to be a student teacher next year. Apparently she‚Äôs kind of like an apprentice taxidermist and stuff. So cool!!!!! No one else came to class except for L. But she was off doing something or another.

F brought up Santa Fe again. This time he‚Äôs got a real plan, I guess he talked to some more school people about it. We might go Oct. 3-6th. He is debating whether to rent a coach, take a train, or drive in a van. We can figure that out later though.

Ahh I can‚Äôt stop smiling. You were right overemotional, he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying..

My mind is so scattered rn  I can barely think.

So he talked to the lady some more, I never caught her name sadly.

She seems really nice.

So he left for almost all of 7th hour showing her around the art department and wood shop and stuff. Athena wandered into class and bugged the hell out of me. She‚Äôs nice but SO annoying.

I feel bad for her though.

When F came back after school i asked him a question about sketchbooks for AP Art next year. I also asked him if there were any local print places with a press I could use during the summer. I just wanted to bring up the idea of me maybe being able to come in a day or two to the classroom during summer. He told me about one local place. I actually know the lady who runs it because her husband is on my stepmoms sales team. We went to her solo show a few months ago.

It was kinda pricy to use the space there unfortunately.

F talked about the art camp thing I‚Äôm doing and we talked about that for a while. We debated what classes would be like etc. He said he was excited for me to be able to go. I think he‚Äôs hoping I get this printmaking shit figured out and I can come back and teach him.

We talked about stuff and things while I was waiting for my dad to pick me up. Damn, I love talking with him so much. He makes me smile so much. I don‚Äôt think I could smile bigger. He makes me feel important. ME, important to an adult I admire. God damn that feeling is fire.

We were talking about school and summer and stuff. He said he‚Äôd probably use the classroom a lot during the summer, he said I could come in and use the press if I wanted. He said he only lived like 5 minutes away. Then somehow we were talking about houses and he was like, you know, you live super close to my mom! He‚Äôs told me this a couple of times before but I never know for certain where she lives. I used to live literally one street away from her. Crazy. He said he thought he drove by my house the other day because he saw my dad our working in the garage.

(Side note: he knows my address because I bought something from him on PayPal that had to be delivered to my house. I can‚Äôt explain what because it might give away his identity.)

F drove by my house. HAHAHAHHA

F fucking knows where I live! I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm happy or embarrassed.

Anyways. We were talking about the digital media lab and how he was gonna organize it next year. He unlocked the room and he was walking around throwing out ideas on how he might organize it.

We talked about that for a bit, then my dad arrived and I said I had to go. I said I‚Äôd try not to bother him in the summer about coming in to work. He said he doesn‚Äôt want me to be nervous and think I‚Äôm imposing on him, that he‚Äôd love to hang out sometime and make art like we do sometimes.

I said ok. I can‚Äôt really describe what was said because what I remember never sounds right in words.  Anyways...

I left and like the whole cake was gone except for two or three slices.

So that‚Äôs my day so far, it‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôre gonna go out for dinner tonight.

I realize I never write EVERYTHING that happens to me in a day down. I just write about F a whole lot and I don‚Äôt really care anymore.

More goes on in my life besides worrying about him. But I just like to keep track. See how things have changed over time with him.


Gotta go now. Phones almost dead and stepmom is home.."
0,"19.05.19. I need a break
Today was a thinking day.

I didn‚Äôt do much, I just lay in bed or walked around.

But it didn‚Äôt feel like a total waste, because I spent the whole day thinking through a lot of things I had to think about.

I always have so much to fucking think about.

Anyways, it was nice to have the time alone.

I‚Äôve been making sure to hang out with people for at least a little bit every day.

But today, I don‚Äôt think I talked to a single person.

Actually, that‚Äôs not true- there was one phone call.

But overall, it was a nice, quiet day. Had its ups and downs, as always. At the very least, I have lots of writing material for tomorrow if I feel like going through it all again later.

But right now, I feel good.

I really needed a day all to myself.

I wish I knew how to balance these alone days with social days so I don‚Äôt fall into total isolation again.

Seeing people every single day is exhausting.

But I guess killing yourself out of loneliness is worse.

Although, I‚Äôm not so sure I would be killing myself out of loneliness anymore. I think that was more a part of my past attempts.

This time, I would just do it cuz I‚Äôm tired.

Sometimes I just wish I could have a break.

It‚Äôs nice to know people care about me.

I know they would be sad if I died. Last time, I figured it would be fine if I killed myself because no one would even notice. And even if they did, who would care?

It used to feel like I was doing people a favour.

Now I know that‚Äôs not true.

They want me here.

But I wonder, if they really care about me, wouldn‚Äôt they just want what‚Äôs best for me?

When I worked at the vet clinic, we used to put animals down all the time. If they were suffering, we did what was best for them, even if it was hard for us.

I‚Äôm suffering, too.

If I could just find a way to make everyone understand, then maybe they won‚Äôt be sad.

And I can die in peace."

Sometimes when I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening with my life I just turn to this subreddit to write it out. Writing things down keeps me calm‚Äîish.

My phone has 8% and I‚Äôm stuck in some graduation ceremony for church. I don‚Äôt know why we had to come tonight. I‚Äôm freezing because I wore my long shorts. Long they may be, I‚Äôve got goosebumps.

Today was okay. We went to Target after church today. I didn‚Äôt buy a single thing. I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself. When I got home I made a lemon bundt cake for art tomorrow. I mentioned something about my birthday and F said, I‚Äôd it your birthday??

I was like, no, it‚Äôs on Monday. He asked if I was bringing cake. I said I could.

So I baked a cake. I hope it turns out okay. It called for a cup of sour cream which I can‚Äôt imagine being good in a cake.

While it was in the oven I started working on my final for history class. I have an outline for what I‚Äôm doing. Women‚Äôs rights. Yay. I‚Äôll have to finish it tonight after this damn graduation ceremony.

At around 3:30 I was about ready to take a break so I checked my phone. I had a message from F. It was about my grades and stuff for class.

He asked where my power project was, I told him I didn‚Äôt do it and gave him the reason why.

My project idea had to do with the pressure I feel like my adult life has to be. Some boring lower middle class christian, cookie cutter life. About marriage and shit.

And I don‚Äôt know that I feel the same way about having a family anymore. And I said that, kinda. I kind of want a family. But I‚Äôm at this moral crossroads. A religious fork in the road.

I gotta pick shit now. I‚Äôve been on this fucking vacation from my faith and I‚Äôve only got one ticket back and it‚Äôs almost expired.

I could get back into the word, run back to my church, to my God. Someday get married, have children. Be a housewife. Live a content life. Die happily and go to heaven.

Or I could live a fun life. I could be who I am. I can listen to rock. Make art, no matter how secular the topic. I could enjoy the pleasures of life. Maybe if I‚Äôm lucky find a man like me. Have some kids even. Become famous or something. My life could be WHATEVER I wanted it to be. But go to hell. In eternal torment. For fucking ever.

But I don‚Äôt even want to think about that. I just wanna make it through college. I just want to make it TO college. Then I can figure out who I am. Who I want to be. Who I should be even.

So anyways, he convinced me to make something. Anything at all to turn in. I can‚Äôt turn just anything in though. My pride is too big. If I‚Äôm gonna turn in something half-assed, it‚Äôs gotta be decent. And I have no decent ideas.

At the end of our short conversation, he just said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll think of something.‚Äù

So I‚Äôve been thinking. For three hours now. So far all I‚Äôve got as far as the power project is some loose ideas about the power religion has over me. Or even the power the voices in my head/my anxiety has over me.

Which is something I‚Äôve kind of been thinking about the last day or so.

I just wish I didn‚Äôt have a fucking art project on my plate right now. I need to do my real school. But I don‚Äôt want to disappoint F.

I feel really shitty now and I want to cut. But I don‚Äôt want to, because I promised myself I‚Äôd stop. I just want to hit myself. A nice bruise on the wrist would be okay. I haven‚Äôt bruised myself in a while. I got worried I cracked some bone in my wrist last time because of the swelling.

Anyways. My phones gonna die. Sunday‚Äôs suck. I always end up feeling really shitty. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint F. But I want to pass my classes.

I need to start thinking about my project. While some big eared guy tells a bunch of college grads to serve the lord faithfully through their life."

Well, technically its 20 may exactly 4:15AM . The day went pretty good actually. Finally, after 14 days I gotta eat biryani one of my fav food (Sunday meal) but last Sunday it wasn't there.


Just an ordinary day no outing nothing ..
After just 3 hours I have my Financial Accounts class at 8AM

Thoughts right now : Should I sleep for 2 hours or keep myself awake.
My friend asked for past papers I have to keep that in my bag

Update : so I have decided to watch 21 Jump Street. It might keep me awake till 7."

I always wanted to have a Diary, a real diary.

Yes mom and dad, a real diary. Not just a notebook that was lying around the house.

But I guess that I will start now, 23 years later, because you guys were too crummy."
0,"The only reason I still post on Re**it is the obligatory upvote.
With most of my comments usually getting downvoted to hell, the single automatic upvote is the only thing which encourages me to bother commenting in the first place.

Add to that the frustration auto-bots dish out from swift deletion of topics.

I think I‚Äôm beginning to understand it now: with the ability for people to downvote opinions comes an apprehension for peers to participate in discussions. Hence an automatic upvote was created as a form encouragement.

I believe if the one-free-upvote system is removed this forum will face a considerable reduction in the amount of members posting thoughts and responses."

my day yesterday would be considered fair. i worked 6 hours and seen a few cute customers. i joked around alot at work and smiled more. the customers noticed me smiling and they loved it. other than that, work was work. i felt better for a brief moment and now im back into depression. i don't have the energy and desire to write the full details of my day.  i been looking into online courses and videos on how to improve my writing and speaking skills but procrastination wins each time.

i talked to my dad for the first time today in two weeks. it was a decent 10 minute chat. hopefully i can meet him in person. he was never there for me but i would like to get to know my dad's side of the family.

i am looking into online jobs. i just have to make sure they are legit and not bullshit. i need another part- time hustle to cover my extra expenses. i just have to make sure it balance out between my regular job and school. i need all the money i can get. i could also use the extra money for therapy.

the next goal is online jobs."

Lol, I can‚Äôt believe how I dissed work last night. Yeah‚Äî it sucks at times. It‚Äôs work. But everyone there is like a second family to me. We act like a big goofy, dysfunctional family.

Who knew a midwestern fast food joint could be a home to me? I never would have expected. AD is a great boss. I‚Äôm even trying to pick up some Spanish to be able to communicate with the guys in the kitchen better. They‚Äôre so nice to me.

It rained a lot today, then it pooped out later in the afternoon and stopped for the day. So work was pretty slow. And I didn‚Äôt have to do headset but for like 15 mins to cover Josue on break.

...

Anyways. I‚Äôm just laying in my bed. My blinds are open but there is no light. The moon is hidden by the dense clouds. If it weren‚Äôt for the streetlight it‚Äôd be pitch dark outside.

I looked for some pajamas or something to wear to bed and grabbed my shorts. The athletic ones. The ones I‚Äôll never be able to wear again. Because I made some really shitty mistakes.

I want to be able to wear shorts and not be judged. I bet I could even have the confidence to wear shorts at school/out in public soon.

But I just can‚Äôt risk it getting back to my parents. I secretly wished they knew sometimes and I didn‚Äôt have to worry.

I don‚Äôt know if there will ever be a point where I can wear normal shorts around my family. Or even out in public. I was looking at some of the oldest scars on my thighs. They‚Äôre barely visible. But then again, they probably weren‚Äôt very deep. I don‚Äôt even know where the ‚Äúoldest‚Äù ones are because there are so fucking many.

Maybe I should just stop.

I don‚Äôt WANT to cut my legs open.

I just do it.

I used to have reasons.

Now I just cut because I feel like I have to.

But I don‚Äôt HAVE to. Do I?

I might invest in some scar healing cream. I‚Äôm going to do some research now. Maybe I‚Äôll ask in r/selfharm

Anyways. Goodnight. I never expected people to read my diary entries. It‚Äôs like venting to the void, but sometimes the void talks back and is really smart."

It‚Äôs been getting harder not to kill myself.

At the testing session yesterday I even accidentally got flagged as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù. They sent someone in to talk to me and everything.

That really freaked me out.

I‚Äôve already been having a tough time with panic attacks between my bouts of sad, empty nothingness, but having them confront me about it so directly just sent me through the roof.

Later that afternoon, something in me snapped.

I dug out an old phone number and sent a text asking if they still did same-day drug pickups.

They did.

I threw out over $200 worth of weed, acid, shrooms, and all related equipment - everything I had - almost a month ago.

I thought it would make it too hard to get my hands on stuff during my cravings, and so I would have to stop for good out of my own sheer laziness.

20 minutes and $50 later, I had everything I needed.

But honestly, just getting it was enough. By the time I was walking back, watching the sun set, I felt good.

I ended up taking my housemate over to a friend‚Äôs house to watch anime. Something dark and twisted. We‚Äôve all been having tough times lately.

That was yesterday.

This morning I woke up, still sober and still suicidal. But not the kind of suicidal that you act on (except in certain moments, but those almost always pass).

I‚Äôm *not* ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù.

I could tell by how I was feeling that today was not going be particularly fun or productive.

So I told myself: *You just need to get out of bed.*

And then I thought: *I can‚Äôt.*

So I told myself: *You can get high. Remember? You already bought a bag yesterday. It‚Äôs all right there, ready for use. Just get out of bed.*

And then I thought: *Ok.*

So I got out of bed.

Then I remembered that I couldn‚Äôt just smoke and chill, because I had lost my house key and had to get a new copy before my housemate needed hers back.

So I told myself: *Just run this quick, tiny errand. Do this one thing, and you can take the rest of the day off. You can even get high - you‚Äôll have earned it.*

So I thought: *Fine.*

And I walked to Canadian Tire.

It‚Äôs a pretty far walk, but I decided against the bus.

Buses give me anxiety when they get too crowded, and when I get like this I have less control over myself than usual.

Better to walk, especially on the weekend when the streets are mostly empty.

Plus, it wasn‚Äôt like I had anything else to do today. I could take as long as I wanted.

The walk made me feel a little better, especially with all the dandelion blooms.

It was like walking through a million tiny suns, all reflecting circles of bright yellow under the warmth of the sunshine overhead.

It made me feel a little less horrible.

After I got my key cut, I realized I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, so I decided to get lunch before I went home.

My favourite chain restaurant was nearly empty, so I figured I‚Äôd stay a while.

I headed to the furthest booth in the back and sat up against the corner, hidden away from the world.

Listening to a podcast, eating my burger, and sitting at a table bathed in sunlight from a nearby window, I finally started to feel the cloud lift.

Not a lot, but a little, which is more than nothing. And definitely more than enough to be grateful for.

I started to think I might not need to get high after all. It was nice to have options, but I wanted to stay sober as long as I could.

I didn‚Äôt want to end up like how I was only a few months ago: failing out of school, too depressed for even basic functions, unable to leave the house or sometimes even my bedroom without intense anxiety, and totally dependent on substances just to keep staying alive.

I knew how easy it would be to slip back into old habits. And I was determined to change them.

It was nice to feel like that again.

Sometimes it gets hard for me to stay hopeful.

I decided I‚Äôd go to the library and try to focus on math when I got home, instead of just getting high and going back to bed. So I could get better.

Then a shadow fell over my table and a voice said: ‚ÄúThose onion rings look delicious.‚Äù

I looked up to see a strange middle-aged man towering over my booth, cornering me in against the wall. He was grinning down at me in earnest.

He seemed very friendly; eager to please.

Maybe a little *too* eager to please.

Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

My instincts took over.

I mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, do you want one?‚Äù

He smiled even bigger, if that was possible.

‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt you a sweet little thing,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very nice of you to offer.‚Äù

Then he walked off.

My heart was pounding, but I shook it off.

He was probably just a little weird. He hadn‚Äôt given me any reason to believe he wanted to hurt me. How was he supposed to know how afraid I was?

I had to calm down.

It wasn‚Äôt fair to act like he was evil just for starting a conversation. I‚Äôve always been the kind of person random people just start talking to. This guy was no different.

He probably just wanted someone to talk to.

Plus, he was gone now.

I went back to eating.

I scrolled through my phone, but I didn‚Äôt even know what I was looking at. My mind was elsewhere. I tried to just focus on my feed and take some deep breaths.

Until he came back.

This time, he came from behind me and put a hand on my shoulder. I was too afraid to even startle properly.

I just froze.

He said: ‚ÄúBy the way, my name‚Äôs James. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù

I told him.

He said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lovely name for a lovely girl. It is lovely to meet you.‚Äù

He stuck out his hand for a handshake, but didn‚Äôt stop when his hand was fully extended. He just kept leaning in until he could grab my hand.

Then he shook it, gripping it tight.

His hand was wet.

He said: ‚ÄúI just washed my hands. But I promise I‚Äôm nice and clean for you; it‚Äôs still safe to eat your food. And you‚Äôll want to, those look pretty yummy!‚Äù

Suddenly, just the thought of eating those onion rings made me sick.

I said: ‚ÄúThose actually just came with my combo, but I‚Äôm full. You can have them if you want.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúReally? Are you sure?‚Äù

I nodded.

He could have anything he wanted if it meant he would leave me alone.

‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù He grinned, and grabbed them off the table.

He bit down on one and made a big show of how much he was enjoying them.

I didn‚Äôt care; I was just glad that both his hands were being kept busy and off of me.

Keeping my gaze on the table, I pretended to scroll through my phone and disengage. I couldn‚Äôt even feel my fingers from the stress.

Then he tapped me again, and I looked up.

His face was right in mine.

Grinning.

He said: ‚ÄúYou know, I do insurance. Here‚Äôs my card, send me a text if you ever need anything.‚Äù

He grabbed my hand and put a business card into it.

Then, still holding my hand, he looked right into my eyes and smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to hear from you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

I didn‚Äôt even move.

Eventually, he got bored and dropped my hand to wander off with my food. I stayed completely frozen.

I don‚Äôt know how much time passed.

At some point, I heard my name called out from across the restaurant.

It was him, wanting my attention so he could wave goodbye on his way out the door.

I forced a polite smile and lifted my hand into a brief pseudo-wave.

Then I went right back to staring at the table.

Once he left, I had a full-on meltdown in the back-corner booth of a burger joint.

Guess I‚Äôm *that* girl now.

Why am I so fucking dramatic?

Nothing even happened.

It took me almost two hours to muster up the courage to leave the restaurant.

I was so afraid he would be waiting outside to catch me, drag me out back and do what he wanted with me.

I‚Äôm so fucking fragile.

Just like that, all my progress was undone.

I couldn‚Äôt calm down.

It‚Äôs pathetic.

The next thing I remember is sitting out in the backyard, bowl in hand.

I breathed deeply and felt that familiar harshness in my chest. Coughed a lot- my lungs had forgotten how it felt to smoke.

Then a wave of calm washed over me, and I could enjoy the sunshine and dandelions again.

How did I ever function without this?"

I was up the whole night yesterday and slept in the morning and get up at 4 pm in the evening with the headache.

Thank God, I take classes just 3 days a week and summers here are just soo hot ( above 30 c every time)

0,"7:56 AM 5/18/19
I didn‚Äôt write anything last night although I should have.

I just fell asleep looking for clothes on H&M.

Yesterday didn‚Äôt feel like Friday. Today does not feel like Saturday. Time is warped. Four more days of school.

I‚Äôm gonna do my history final on Sunday. Print out my fitness log on Sunday and sign it.
Study for my math final on Monday. Which sucks because it‚Äôs my birthday. And then study for my English test Tuesday. Make that fucking band poster Tuesday. And do my art final Wednesday night.

I really should call in sick on Tuesday, but I need every extra dollar I can get right now.

Anyways that was more of a personal note for myself.

Yesterday was pretty average. We didn‚Äôt do jack shit all day. Except for a ‚Äúprivilege walk‚Äù in history. Even in art, I just sat there for two whole periods. I tried to be productive, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to be. I wore my black shorts I made myself. The ones that are just barely long enough to cover my scars, but if I sit a certain way, they show.

And I sat in that certain way in art. Because I‚Äôm an attention whore who just wants F to ask how I‚Äôm doing. He didn‚Äôt comment. But if I were him I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything either because we all know what happened last time.

At the end of 7th hour, I had him sign my independent study paper again. I told him I‚Äôd spilled something on my other yesterday and I texted him asking if he was gonna be at school today. It was a desperate way to do it, but I just had to know if he was gonna be there.

I put my stuff together to leave, and kind of awkwardly stood there looking at my phone. I nervously asked if I could wait in his classroom for my dad because it‚Äôs kind of hot and humid out. I said my dad would be here in 20 mins and couldn‚Äôt pick me up yet because he had someone over at the house.

Which was a total lie. I just didn‚Äôt want to leave yet. If I‚Äôm staying after school I try not to talk too much. Only if he initiates it.

He was working on scrubbing out the sink. He said something about his cat being old and he forgot and she didn‚Äôt land right when he nudged her off the kitchen counter yesterday. He said he felt really bad about it. Then he asked if I have any pets. I told him I did, well, I technically do, they were just with my uncle. And my dog is with some coworker of his.

He seemed confused but I think he fit the pieces together about my mom.

I got kinda sad, I really miss them.

We also talked about cars and driving and I mentioned that we were selling my moms old car so I could use the money towards one of my own. He asked what kind of car, and if it still worked. I said it still worked fine. And then he was like, can‚Äôt you just drive that? And I‚Äôm like well..... I could I just.. and then he was like ... or you just don‚Äôt want to drive it. I understand.

Oh and also during class we talked more about our trip for next year. He, like me, looked up the driving time to Santa Fe and realized it was like 12+ hours. Then I mentioned we could take a train. He said that was a good idea, I could tell I really got some gears turning. He said he‚Äôs never been on a train in the US. I said it was pretty easy and stuff. Just hop on at Union Station, and you‚Äôre off.

He looked up train ticket prices to Santa Fe, and they were like 130$ a pop.

We were throwing around ideas as a class and he brought up renting a charter bus. Immediately I was like, that‚Äôd be way too expensive. Those things aren‚Äôt cheap, plus they‚Äôre probably way too big for a group of 10ish people.

That got us talking about how awful greyhound busses are. And then he was like, are trains creepy and stuff? He asked if there was much difference between a train and a greyhound. I said there really wasn‚Äôt much difference except the train goes faster, and the people usually aren‚Äôt so crazy.

He realized if we tried to do this on a three day weekend during the school year, we wouldn‚Äôt have hardly any time at all there. For example, leave early Friday morning. Get there Friday evening. Go to bed. Then we would have all of Saturday there. Then Sunday we would leave early in the morning and get home Sunday night before school. It just doesn‚Äôt make much sense to do a whole trip for only ONE day.

Then he thought about doing it in summer, like right after school gets out. And at first, I was like, darn, that‚Äôs so far away. But when I got home I was thinking about it and it would be so much better to do it after school got out next year.

I‚Äôd be graduated, already 18, and by late May next year, I‚Äôd already have left F. But then surprise! We‚Äôre going on a senior trip. A last hurrah so to speak.

I plan on writing him the most heartfelt thank you letter he‚Äôs ever laid his eyes on next year when I leave. I‚Äôll give it to him the last day of school.

BUT THEN, awesome senior trip with the gang a few weeks later! And by then, he will have read my letter and might finally understand how much he has meant to me.

Ahh I‚Äôm so excited for next year.

But I gotta get serious about my art right now. After finals anyways.

So much to do.

And now I‚Äôve gotta go work for 10 hours.

And I cut myself more last night. I don‚Äôt even know why.

Fuckkkkkk this"

i just wanted to check back in. its midnight on a thursday right now. thunderstorm outside. insomnia from concussion (lacrosse); cant sleep. girlfriend and i hit 10 months tomorrow, money is still tight but i think im coping efficiently. now my main goal is to support my girlfriend, shes been getting very deppressed lately as a side effect of medicine for her newly diagnosed crohns disease (she was in hospital for like 2 weeks and almost died when an intestinal cist burst) ive been helping her find coping skills and teaching her the stuff i learned freshman year when i was in the hospital after my suicide attempt. as of right now i am recovering from a concussion but im feeling great. today was such a great day and from now on every day will be great. i havent cut since, though ive been close. and to whoever gave me the gold, thank you. so much. my phone broke, (my new from box s6 bricked itself after about a year.) and i havent been able to get a new one for monatary reasons. so i havent been on reddit in over a month. i lied, it was almost midnight, now its officially midnight. im kind of overwhelmed lately, i completed my eagle project for boy scouts, which was stressing me out, now just all the paperwork, which isnt hard i just have trouble with it. and then june 9 i go back to work at scout camp all summer, away from my family, in peace. i have my prom saturday, which im excited for, i went to my girlfriends (different schools) last saturday in the heart of my concussed state and danced and had fun through the pain and dizziness, the earplugs helped a lot. im rambling, just kinda pouring out everything because even if nobody reads this, it helps me. i havent been taking my adhd meds lately because i havent had them, and ive alwasy wanted off of them but assumed it impossible, but since ive been off them, ive started to twitch less (side effect) i feel happier, so much happier. and i feel i focus just as well and that im more sociable. i talked for like an hour with a group of popular kids today and i fit in, they liked me. all i had to do was talk, and not be scared and just be who i am. its crazy how not being able to really afford meds has come through and done all this for me. everything happens for a reason. oh what else, oh, i turn 18 soon and i think im going to driv6 hours out to iowa to buy my dream car, a cj7 jeep, and drive it home. i have enough money in my savings that id like to use for it, as it would be so much more fuel efficient and smaller and just more ""me"" than my current truck. i know with money being tight it sounds dumb but, itll have cheaper insurance, and gas, and it will be mine, and even if it isnt practical its mine, its something i have control over. 12:10, i have to wake up at 6:30. i think im gonna go lie down, if even just to rest my eyes from looking at a screen. i hope that you all get notified of this, i cant remember anything right now, i forgot the name for a banana yesterday, but i think reddit tells you all if i comment. i dont know. hopefully. 12:13. i love you all, thank you for making me feel like i belong. and supporting me. and thank you for the gold. i dont think i really deserved it but you did. i just wish you werent anonymous and that i could thank you directly. 12:15, goodnight. see you in the morning

edit, 12:39. exhauated but cant sleep. i hear a train outside , i love to lislten to them, i like trains. 12:40. the dog sighed, shes supposed to be in her crate but she got out because she was scared of the storm, storms over now but she gets to sleep in my room. 12:41. sitting here wanting to say more but im empty, out of emotions to spill. 12:42, train horn, another one and another and another and anotherm hes leaving the train yard, probably heading to the east coast. 12:43, maybe i should write a blog, i had one and never used it. would anyone even read it? maybe this comment should be a post all its own. another train horn, another. and more and more. i dont know what they mean anymore, not at 12:44. 12:45. you can tell i live in the midwest, because i say goodbye or goodnight 6 times before i actually go or sleep. 12:46. writing everything i think is like sleeping. but sleeping is more like sleeping. closing the laptop now. train horn. its far away now, hardly within earshot. 12:47. like the train horn i drift off. goodnight.

i ended up getting 2 hours of sleep last night. i just sat and listened to the trains. and eventually forced myself to sleep"

Today I had three iced coffees. The cashiers at Tim Horton‚Äôs know me on sight now.

It didn‚Äôt help.

I‚Äôm still exhausted.

I‚Äôm tired when I wake up.

I spend all day tired and achy.

Force myself to stay up as long as I can.

Usually I alternate between doing calculus and hanging out with whichever friend is around and wants to chill.

The only time I really feel awake is when the panic attacks kick in. Then I‚Äôm wired- adrenaline will do that to you. But those are miserable, and when they‚Äôre over I‚Äôm even more exhausted.

Then I go to sleep and try my best not to dream.

It almost never works.

I really miss weed.

...

Update:

It‚Äôs now past midnight, so of course I‚Äôm wide awake.

All I want to do is sleep.

So why can‚Äôt I?

...I wonder if it has something to do with the three iced coffees I had today.

Maybe caffeine just takes a long time to kick in.

Like, twelve hours.

Hmm, maybe that‚Äôs not it.

Guess it‚Äôs just anxiety."

So we had Panda Express for lunch

I did a whole lot of nothing today

Played email tag with my counselor about schedule changes for next year.

And F replied to my message. He said what I thought he‚Äôd say. I don‚Äôt know why I made such a big deal about it.

I went to talk to my counselor about schedule stuff during 7th hour. I think I‚Äôve got things figured out. I just want to be in 5th and 6th. That‚Äôs my priority.

I realized I might need to use the classroom a day or two later in June for the press. Why did I have to choose such a complicated concentration idea?

He said he‚Äôd be in the classroom during summer making photos and stuff.

He told lily and I this hilarious story about this kid shitting his pants back when he taught elementary school.

OH! And I think he decided where he wants to go if we did a trip. Santa Fe! How fun. We would go to Meow Wolf, look at galleries and museums/other touristy stuff. Maybe do a workshop in Albuquerque.

Lily brought up the topic of personality types. Specifically Meyer-Briggs. She asked F what type he was. He said he‚Äôd taken it a long time ago and forgot.

Somehow we got him to look at the website. I told him I thought he was totally an ENFP. He was just looking at the brief summary of some of the other types and I don‚Äôt think he really connected with the ENFP.

He took the test and got INFP. I was close! I told him we were INFP buddies.

Suddenly everything made sense. F is just like me in a lot of ways. He said he‚Äôd read the profile when he got home.

I wonder if he thought about me... when reading the personality profile. Obviously himself because it was his results...  but he knows that I‚Äôm an INFP as well.  Just a hopeful thought.

I screen printed a T-shirt with a brayer design on it. I‚Äôm thinking about doing another tomorrow.

I‚Äôll coat the screen in seminar. Then do the rest in class/after school.

Today was a good day. F always makes it better.

I just want to get into his head, I want to understand what drives him. What his goals are‚Äî speaking of goals, lily was talking about his teaching job and stuff, and he asked him what his absolute dream job would be besides teaching. He said he loves teaching, but his real dream is to have a photography/printmaking studio with a gallery and studio and stuff.

And that‚Äôs funny‚Äî because that‚Äôs very similar to my ideal dream job. If I could be doing anything, it‚Äôd be the same exact thing. Except with printmaking or drawing.

Great minds think alike. Or INFP‚Äôs think alike.

It‚Äôs a great comfort knowing we have something in common.

Knowing that I COULD be like him someday.

That‚Äôs all I really long for."

My problems seem so shallow sometimes.

My issues worthless.

And they probably are. ‚Äî I know they are.

And I‚Äôm almost ashamed of myself. No‚Äî I am. I am ashamed of myself.

I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for exploiting him for attention. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for squeezing every last drop of notice out of him.

I‚Äôm ashamed for a great deal of other things. But this one takes the cake in this last year of my life.

My obsession has led me to desperation.

...

I found out that advanced art was no longer 6th and 7th period next year. Rather 5th and 6th. My head went into panic mode trying to figure out how to fix it. I just want to be in both sections. But I want to be in 7th hour as well.

I don‚Äôt want to drop digital design. Mrs. H has been so good to me. She‚Äôs literally buying the remaining class Panda Express tomorrow. How could I ever tell her I‚Äôm dropping her class next year.

First I dropped creative writing with Mrs. A. One of the most kind teachers ever. Now Mrs. H.

All a sacrifice to be with F.

I‚Äôll drop 5th hour Digital Design and replace it with AP Studio Art.

I‚Äôll do my independent study 6th hour.

I confessed to F that I really wanted to be in both sections of advanced art. But I told him that would leave me without a 7th hour. I asked if he needed a lab aid.

He said sure! Then he said that since it was the drawing 1 class, that I‚Äôd have to model for them now and then. For drawing.

I was surprised I could be a drawing model. I‚Äôm not exactly model material. I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô lump of flesh with pancake flat dyed ginger hair with bangs. Not to mention I‚Äôm borderline obese. Just on the edge. I have bad posture and horrible fashion sense.

But he said I would make a good model. I felt just horrible for asking to be a lab aid. That‚Äôs three classes in a row with him. I hope I didn‚Äôt come across as weird.

Then it hit me‚Äî I‚Äôd also signed up for photography with him. That‚Äôs four fuckin‚Äô classes a day with him.

I said that aloud. (Not the fuckin‚Äô part but you get the idea.)

Before I left I asked if it was okay‚Äî taking so many classes and stuff. I said I didn‚Äôt want to take up so many of his classes etc.

He said he would love to have me. Or something along those lines. Maybe I‚Äôm just wishing he said that.

But I felt embarrassed. Excited but embarrassed. The excitement was barely there. A mere seed, left unwatered.

I left. Went home. Got ready for work in a hurry. And I wrote him a message and sent him it on GroupMe.

...

‚ÄúAbout the whole lab aiding thing for 7th hour, if you‚Äôve got someone who‚Äôd be a better drawing model wanting to do it, don‚Äôt feel like you have to pick me. I‚Äôm not exactly model material if you know what I mean. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to do it, I‚Äôd be totally up for it! I just don‚Äôt want you to be stuck with me if there‚Äôs someone better suited.

And if I‚Äôm imposing on too many of your classes please tell me. I feel like I already bother you a ton and the last thing I want to be is annoying.

I just wanted to run this by you before I ask the counselor to change my schedule. I‚Äôm really sorry, and thanks for putting up with so much of me all the time.‚Äù

...

And it seemed like a good idea. At the time. And it did. For a few hours.

What‚Äôs worse is it says read 3:59 PM.

It‚Äôs 9:25 PM and no response.

And that‚Äôs why I wonder if it was a bad idea. And that‚Äôs why I feel gross. I feel like I‚Äôm exploiting F to make myself feel better about myself.

No‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing!! I‚Äôm so disgusting. I‚Äôm a disgusting addict. An addict who‚Äôs found the perfect source. Reliable.

All I aimed to get out of that was for him to tell me that I‚Äôd be a fine model. And that I don‚Äôt annoy him at all.

Because THATS THE TRUTH.

That‚Äôs what he believes. And I know it. And I know he knows it. And I know that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd tell me. (If he responded.)

I know he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying. I think. He made the new group chat for next years group and I was the first person and only person he added. I was sitting on the couch in Mrs. H‚Äôs room and I smiled so big. I think I teared up.

It‚Äôs the small things like that. Being added to the group chat first. Things like that make me feel like I‚Äôve actually done something with my life. It sounds so dull when I talk about it. But it just meant SO much to me.

He means so much to me.

...

ALSO BIG TEA TIME.

I‚Äôll keep it short because idgaf.

So J started talking about H and who he liked etc. Then as we talked I realized every other person in the room besides H knows how much M loves him and wants to be in a relationship with him. But we all know that H likes her but they‚Äôre both too scared to say anything.

Typical teenage love story‚Äî but it‚Äôs so friggin cute. It was just hilarious because like 5 of us girls were all in on it. J eventually told H that M liked him, after he confessed to liking M.

We all were soooo loud and so fucking excited. F looked so confused.

I‚Äôve never been happier for the two of them. They‚Äôre gonna make a cute couple. I really hope they make each other happy.

...

But back to reality.

F has not responded and I‚Äôm so ashamed. I‚Äôm trying not to be mad because he probably just isn‚Äôt on his phone. Life happens, stuff happens. He‚Äôs a busy guy.

Ugh. Anyways.

Athena is gonna be in AP next year. She‚Äôs so fucking annoying. Not in a naggy way, but a weird kind of way. Just the way she talks and the things she does. She‚Äôs so fucking weird and I don‚Äôt hate her. Hell I invited her to CC two years ago. She‚Äôs a nice kid don‚Äôt get me wrong.

I just don‚Äôt want to let her into our little class. Our little family.

And the same goes to a bunch of people. Fucking Jake of all people is taking Art Portfolio. JAKE?!

I am so afraid for the future. I‚Äôm so excited. But I‚Äôm sad that this year is dead and dying. I miss the seniors. I miss it all.

I texted Ellie today. I miss her too even though she graduated last year.

I miss it all.

I‚Äôm ashamed of myself.

I‚Äôm scared for the future.

But it‚Äôs a selfish fear.

A fear I feel I shouldn‚Äôt have the right to feel.

...

I just want him to respond to me. Or else tomorrow is gonna be awkward as HELL.

Update 9:53 PM:

It dawned on me. He‚Äôs been at graduation.
Wow I‚Äôm the supreme dumbass.

Way to go."

I was sitting at the table with my headphones on, eating my family‚Äôs leftovers for dinner.

We were on vacation. Earlier, I had been banished from attending the fancy restaurant we had booked.

My mom addressed the situation logically.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming to dinner,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúYou look like a homeless person. This is a nice restaurant; it would be embarrassing for us to be seen with you. We‚Äôll bring you leftovers, your brother always orders too much anyways.‚Äù

...Nothing she said was wrong.

I was just happy to have an excuse to stay behind.

It had been getting harder for me to hide the fact that I was only eating 450 calories a day when I had to eat every meal with my family.

That, coupled with my intense fear of leaving my room to interact with the outside world, had been making our nightly family vacation dinners tough.

Plus, getting some alone time - after spending nearly two weeks non-stop with only my family - sounded more like a reward than a punishment.

Although, I wasn‚Äôt sure it was meant to be a punishment at all.

If my mom had wanted me to change my clothes, all she had to do was ask. She knew I would.

Maybe she just didn‚Äôt want me there.

Once they left, I had my sister text me a picture of the menu.

I spent the remainder of my alone time googling and memorizing how many calories were in each item so I would know exactly which leftovers to eat, and how much, without raising suspicion.

But I shouldn‚Äôt have bothered.

When my family got back, the only person who even looked at me was my mom as she gracelessly dropped a bag on the table and said, ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù and put my headphones back on.

Then I started counting out grains of rice.

I think I was on #36 when I looked up from my plate.

Right there in front of me, my dad was collapsed on the floor, and my mom was screaming at a 911 operator through the phone.

Let me just say: Bose makes some quality soundproof headphones.

To this day, I still have no idea what happened.

I watched as my dad forced himself to his feet and stumbled towards the balcony for some fresh air.

I couldn‚Äôt believe I had been worried about something as stupid as grains of rice.

My mom looked at me and said, ‚ÄúGo help him.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to ask: *How?*

But she was already out the door. Something about going to let the paramedics in.

And just like that, my dad and I were alone.

He‚Äôs always saying we should spend more time together.

Guess he got what he asked for.

My dad was half-standing, half-collapsed against the balcony railing. Dripping sweat into the frigid winter night, he heaved deep breaths that rattled in and out.

I hovered in the doorway, afraid to breathe at all.

He refused to look at me, choosing instead to stare out into the darkness. I tried not to shiver from the cold as I stood with him in silence.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if my mind was racing or frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I just said: ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

He turned to face me.

I‚Äôve never seen such disgust in someone‚Äôs eyes.

If that was even what was there at all - I only got to see for a fraction of a second before his gaze shifted past me to the front door.

My mom came bursting through it with a paramedic, who was shouting into a radio. The blocky, outdated thing produced so much static you could barely hear the voice shouting back through the other side.

Staring straight ahead, my dad shoved me as hard as he could and staggered past me to the paramedic, where he collapsed into her arms.

My spine connected with the corner of the table as his shove threw me off balance, and it was my turn to collapse as searing pain ripped through my body.

Unlike my dad, though, no one was there to catch me.

I fell to the floor.

From there, I was helpless to watch as my parents left with the paramedic.

I wondered if this was the last time I‚Äôd ever see my dad.

On their way out my mom turned back to look at me.

She said: ‚ÄúThe kids are in the other room. Make sure they‚Äôre asleep by the time we get back.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat should I tell them?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an idiot.‚Äù

Then the door clicked shut behind them."

i had an okay mother's day weekend. on mother's day i didn't work so i just stayed home. i was supposed to to do the breast cancer walk but that never happened. next year i guess.

right now im feeling some kind of way because today i got yelled at by a customer because he needed help with paying with two separate cards. one was food stamps card and the other debit.  i took $4 off the food stamp card and the guy.paid the rest with debit and got $25 cash back. after everything was done, he got mad and bitched that i left him with $.47 on his food stamp card and that he cant do shit with it. well sorry! i thought you wanted to take the remaining amount on the damn card. if you want your money back go to customer service not the fucking cashier. douchebag mother fucker.

I am also beginning to see how deceptive people can be. i had a customer that tried to give me a fake $100 and his excuse was that it got wet in his pocket. then he gave me a real $10 to pay for his stuff. yeah you are not slick asshole. people really aint shit smh...

I have something else to get off my chest. Whenever someone has a problem they always take it out on me. you know i dont appreciate that and sooner or later ill get strong enough to act an ass and be sassy as hell about it. this is going for customers and my coworkers."

I had a day off yesterday.I joined a meeting with a kinder-garden teacher which will be my younger kids'.

Discuss about the education of Waldorf with her.

Also we try to find a flat that we will move to around the weekend,but it's not easy to find it.

I also picked up my kids to go to school by motorbike yesterday that he requested me before.

He was exciting about it,because he told me he never went to school by took a motorbike. So I did it.

But I was sad that he told me he was beaten by his classmate.

It happened few times he told me.Sometimes he fight with the boy,but he felt bad about fighting.

I told him when he was beaten then he need to fight to protect himself.

I don't know if I were correct or not.I hope he can become brave.My older boy was a kind person,he always request me to gave him money to support beggar,maybe because I always told him to help others.

Although he seems timid,but I thought he need times to develop his mindset.

My wife told me he is very powerful in fact,but I am not scenes.„ÄÄ

My kids was just too kind to fight.

I am having a great day.

Just great.

Every weekend I feel like shit because I think F hates me, but then he somehow makes my day amazing.

All of the seniors were gonna so it was just us Juniors. We hand painted T-shirt screens. I started to make one but it looked crappy so I made one of a brayer. It‚Äôs a little plain but it‚Äôll be cool.

F suggested I add something to it but I didn‚Äôt end up doing it. I really like our class. It‚Äôs a good group. None of them are very serious about art besides Lilah and River, but they‚Äôre all good people.

When everyone left I was drying my screen still and F commented on how good I always am at cleaning up. Some people left out paintbrushes from the screen painting.

F started talking about how we might do things different in class next year. He said he wanted to make projects looser. He said he wants to do research differently or not at all. I agreed. I don‚Äôt think he understands why we don‚Äôt like/find the research helpful.

I said we should do more critiques so we could at least get more comfortable with them. He agreed.

River brought these awesome sugar cookies and we all had a few. They were amazing. After I had one I asked if I could have a second. And F was like I‚Äôm glad you asked because I was gonna get another too. He‚Äôs so funny.

After a while he mentioned doing a trip. Kind of like how band/choir/orchestra/even Spanish does a trip to some where.  I got so excited. I kept telling him what a good idea and how fun that would be. He seemed really excited about the idea and really seemed like he wanted to make it happen.

We talked about LA, or going to Art Basel in Miami, or Chicago, even Italy. Athena brought up the cost factor, but I said that if we wanted to go we could all figure out a way to come up with the money. I know I‚Äôd save for it.

Art Basel sounded like a whole lot of fun. I am so  fuckin excited. I never dreamed of doing something like this. F seems to really like traveling. I kept telling him how fun going on a trip would be.

He said the only issue is that unless it‚Äôs a trip FOR the school. It can‚Äôt be associated with the school in any way. He couldn‚Äôt make students go, he couldn‚Äôt even organize it at school. He can‚Äôt even use his school email for anything related to it either. Just a liability thing.

How fun would it be to go on a trip with F and the crew. Omg I‚Äôm just dying thinking of how fun it would be. It‚Äôd be a dream come true. A literal dream come true.

He seems so adamant about making it happen.

God, this year is gonna be amazing.

Camp at my dream college over the summer.
Being a senior.
Finishing my portfolio and applying to dream college.
Having a whole ‚Äònother year with F and the gang.
A TRIP FOR AP/IB ART?!!!!!

Anyways..
He didn‚Äôt have to pick up his son early today, so we stayed a few minutes later. When we were cleaning up to leave, I was carrying the closed jars of screen filler and drawing fluid and I dropped the bottle of drawing fluid and it spilled al over the floor. There was so much.

I‚Äôm thankful I wasn‚Äôt on my period and super hormonal or I would have burst out crying. I just kept saying I was sorry and we tried scraping it up to clean it. F went down to get a mop.

We eventually cleaned it all up but I felt really bad. It was quite the mess. He didn‚Äôt seem mad at all but I felt pretty shitty. I still do.



Anyways I‚Äôm gonna eat dinner now, but I‚Äôm SO EXCITED AHHHHHHHHHHHH.

I fucking love F and the whole art department."
0,"13.05.19. Mother‚Äôs Day
It was Mother‚Äôs Day yesterday.

My way of coping was by refusing to acknowledge it.

Weirdly, though, it happened anyways.

So here‚Äôs how mine went.

I sent my mom a GIF of a mother twerking to a caption saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù until she accidentally booty bumps her kid across the room.

My mom loved it.

She showed it to all her friends.

She even texted me about it again this morning.

Apparently, their kids forgot to text.

So my mom wins.

She‚Äôs the best mom. She was so thrilled. It‚Äôs the proof of my love that she wanted - better, because it‚Äôs a portable copy.

As for me? I spent Mother‚Äôs Day taking care of the kids.

I woke up to a phone call from my sister crying in the bathroom. She forgot to take her pill and then had unprotected sex and let him finish inside her.

Fucking teenagers.

(Literally. Lol!)

I asked all the right questions and guided her to the right resources (read: I have a middle school sex education and let Planned Parenthood deal with her).

When I had done everything I could (which was mostly tell her to call Planned Parenthood), I hung up.

But two minutes later she sent me a text:

*planned parenthood is closed*

So I did some googling and within 30 seconds discovered she was fine as long as she took both pills the next day. She didn‚Äôt even need to call them.

So I texted her back:

*dw, you‚Äôre fine. I googled it*

She said:

*ok*
*thank you*

But I knew what she was thinking.

I knew she could have easily googled it herself. In fact, she probably did before she called me. After all, she‚Äôd already taken the second pill.

That wasn‚Äôt why she texted me.

She texted me because she needed comfort.

She needed someone who was calm and unshakeable and was going to help her without a second thought even though she made a mistake.

She needed someone who would tell her that she fucked up, but not that she *was* a fuckup.

She texted me because she needed someone who would love her no matter what.

No matter how many mistakes she makes. No matter how little she calls me unless she needs something. No matter how whiny or bitchy or needy she is.

She texted me because she knows I‚Äôll always be there.

And because she was anxious, and she wanted to feel better, and she didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

She texted me because she wanted her mom.

So I texted her:

*this happens, you‚Äôre ok :)*

*call me back if you need to*

And she replied:

*i love you*

Later in the day I got a facetime from the seven year old. I picked up the phone and before the screen could even show her face she screamed:

‚ÄúPULL DOWN YOUR SHIRT,‚Äù

Every time she sees me, the first thing she does is check to see if I‚Äôm still wearing the locket she gave me.

I always am.

So I pulled down my shirt so she could see it and opened it up and pulled out the note she put in there that says *I love you* in her little kid handwriting.

And she nodded in approval and said, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

Then she jumped right into what she wanted to tell me.

She‚Äôs all business, that one.

My mom spends every Mother‚Äôs Day looking for proof that we love her. So we buy her coffee and make her cards and go out to dinner, and she‚Äôs happy.

No one does that stuff for me.

They don‚Äôt need to.

I get my proof every day.

Because I‚Äôm around to see it.

Even on Mother‚Äôs Day, even when I‚Äôm far away, the moms will be celebrating all that they do for the family, while I take care of their kids.

My mom asks if we love her all the time.

If someone really loves you, you‚Äôll never need to ask.

They‚Äôll let you know.

You just have to be there to hear it."

Mother‚Äôs Day.

I barely even cried. Just teared up once or twice in the morning.

I thought I‚Äôd cry more. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so numb today.

Last time I saw mom was Mother‚Äôs Day last year. It‚Äôs almost been a year without her.

I wore the watch I gave to her last year. The matching watch I bought for her and her mom. I wonder if Grammy wore it today.

Probably not.

But I wore it today. I‚Äôm not a mom. But I‚Äôm the only living thing who is proof of her motherhood.

Well there‚Äôs my sister. I wonder if she ever cries for mom. She‚Äôs been brainwashed by my dad for too many years. I don‚Äôt doubt she at least thought of her today.

But does she cry?

It‚Äôs been a year. I mourned and mourned, came to terms, mourned and mourned more. Came to terms, mourned and mourned again. And it just repeats and repeats.

I was just out of the mourning cycle today.

I fucking miss her so much. It‚Äôs not fair. I want her back. I want a chance to say goodbye. I want a chance to hug her. At least give me that.

I had no fucking warning. I pay the price for ignorance.

I don‚Äôt know what to say besides I miss her. I wonder if she‚Äôs okay.

My religion tells me she‚Äôs burning in hell. My heart knows it‚Äôs true. I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been so against my faith this last year even more so than the previous year.

Even if I were still saved. And I died tonight. Went to heaven. How could I be happy knowing my mother is burning in eternal anguish and punishment.

Part of me wants to believe she‚Äôs in heaven. She believed. I know she did.

But believing isn‚Äôt enough. Even the demons believe.

But I can‚Äôt bear to think about all of this. I feel guilty and alone and mad at God.

I‚Äôm mad at him for not giving me a chance to say goodbye. I didn‚Äôt get no fucking hand holding in some hospital bed.

She died in her sleep. Alone. In her shitty apartment. All by herself. Totally and completely alone. Except for the company of Louie. No hug goodbye. No I love you. NO WARNING. She was sick but she was still working. I thought it was just pneumonia. Maybe it was. I don‚Äôt even know. I don‚Äôt even know what the death certificate says her cause of death was.

I need to know.

I don‚Äôt remember the last time I told her I loved her.

I don‚Äôt know if I ever did.

And I‚Äôm mad. For so many reasons.

All this grief has been bottled up for an entire year, and I‚Äôm not much better. Turned into me fucking cutting myself because I felt like shit because I missed her so much. Then I cut because I hated myself. Now I cut because I‚Äôm addicted.

I miss you mom. I hope you can hear me. I wish you could. I hope you don‚Äôt see me like this.

There‚Äôs so much I want to say to you. But most of it isn‚Äôt even able to be expressed with words.

I wish you could feel my tears. Because so many of them are for you.

Fuck Mother‚Äôs Day.

I want my mom back."

I have a lot of trouble paying attention.

Right now, I‚Äôm trying to do my calculus homework. I‚Äôm already behind, since I joined the course late and then didn‚Äôt do any work.

But I got 100% on both the quizzes without studying, so the little motivation I started with got shot to hell.

I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrying‚Äù to do it (unsuccessfully) all day.

Instead of my homework, though, I goofed off and hung out with friends and watched TV.

Avoided my desk.

Found every excuse I could to put it off longer.

I did everything I usually do.

Until the cravings hit.

Doing nothing endlessly often leads to cravings, because it gives me time to think.

So I decided to channel all that focus; that need to do *something* - drink, drugs, cut, cry - into my homework.

I usually swap one coping mechanism for another.

Why not trade cutting for calculus?

Drugs for derivatives?

Panic attacks for... well, still panic attacks. But at least the math-related ones are more productive.

It worked for about five minutes.

The problem is, my homework is SO boring.

Well, the homework isn‚Äôt boring. Practise problems are fine for me to focus on once I understand the material.

The problem is, I don‚Äôt understand the material.

Because to understand the material, you have to watch the lecture videos.

And the lecture videos are *SO* boring.

I simply can‚Äôt watch them.

So I skip right to the practise problems instead.

But I don‚Äôt know how to do them, because I didn‚Äôt watch the lecture videos.

See the problem?

Instead I‚Äôm watching a different, more interesting, faster paced online video, taking notes, desperately hoping this will teach me what I need to know.

But I don‚Äôt even know if this is what I need to know. It‚Äôs all in the lecture videos. If I just watched them, I would know if this is what I need to know or not.

But I can‚Äôt watch them.

I try.

But it doesn‚Äôt even matter. I just space out and then suddenly they‚Äôre over.

And honestly, I can‚Äôt even focus on the other fucking video either. I keep rewinding it because I spaced out.

I‚Äôm so fucking sick of trying and it not even mattering.

But what else can I do?

The answer is nothing.

I just have to try again.

No point complaining about it.

It‚Äôs my own fucking fault for being so distracted.

I might not even have ADHD. The stupid testing lady thinks I just have PTSD and a bad attitude.

Well, she didn‚Äôt say that exactly.

But I can tell.

And she wasn‚Äôt stupid. She was nice.

I just really wish I could focus.

I was a happy person with proper family struggling to achieve something in my life but never gets anything what I ever wanted to have ...

In the mid of DEC I had breakup with the person I always wanted to be ... But after all this time I can't forget her...

3:09... I got a text from her after so long I really felt happy all of the sudden..but another second I was very depressed I just want to forget her but whenever I tried it something tragic always happens ... So,I have her ""commercial laws"" book so she wants it back by tomorrow but I really don't wanna face her anymore it will remind of the past the happiness  the joy, the good old days but I have to return it...

So tomorrow when she will go to library and will place her bag in the shelf I will put that book under her bag and will text her to pick it up...

I hope everything works as I have planned it to be....

Today, me and my housemate went to a friend‚Äôs house to do some school stuff together.

We did a little bit of work.

...But mostly, we binge watched TV.

We got snacks and opened the door and windows to let in as much light and sunshine as we could, and then we spent most of the day enjoying the show and each other‚Äôs company.

We couldn‚Äôt help ourselves - it was too gorgeous a day to waste being stressed and miserable.

Plus, it‚Äôs a Saturday. And summer!

Around 3pm I made myself call it quits so I could go home and do something productive while there was still some daytime left.

My friend had to go to campus, so we all walked back together laughing and chatting.

I spent the rest of the day unpacking my room. Everything is finally organized and put away. It‚Äôs so nice to finally be settled.

Now it really feels like I‚Äôm home.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, today had lots of stress and things to worry about. My life is far from perfect.

I actually had to push back going to my friends house to an hour later because I was too busy curled up crying on my bedroom floor.

But that stuff is just a part of my life now. Honestly, I‚Äôm just relieved I only wasted an hour feeling that bad today before I managed to snap myself out of it.

Overall, today was the most average day I‚Äôve had in a long time.

I even texted my friend about a guy she‚Äôs going out with. It was the most mundane, exciting conversation I‚Äôve had in ages. It‚Äôs such a normal thing to talk about.

There were no crazy highs or lows today. No huge emotional breakthroughs.

Nothing happened today that I‚Äôm gonna remember forever.

It was just an average day.

I was just an average teenager (young adult?), hanging out with friends and doing homework and goofing off and cleaning my room.

God, it felt good.

My life has been a lot of things, but average isn‚Äôt one of them.

I‚Äôm so sick of feeling like an imposter in my own life.

Of having experiences so crazy I can‚Äôt even talk about them because people think I‚Äôm making them up.

Of not having anyone to relate to when I feel alone.

Of wondering if I would ever really get better and be able to have a normal life.

Today, though, I did it.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll stick. If I know one thing about myself it‚Äôs that I tend to change pretty fast. I know better than to bother getting used to anything.

But I had a perfectly normal day today.

I had my bad moments. But who doesn‚Äôt?

That‚Äôs normal too. Even if the things I was stressed about maybe aren‚Äôt.

Something I‚Äôm learning is that pain is universal.

Everyone has stuff they‚Äôre stressed about. I‚Äôm not any different from anybody else for being anxious. And they‚Äôre not any different from me, either.

By the end of the day, when I ate dinner with my other housemate, I was worn out.

But it wasn‚Äôt my usual unbearable fatigue from sadness and stress and being overwhelmed.

I was just tired because I had a full day.

Now I‚Äôm curled up in bed.

My room is clean and all my stuff in the right place.

I don‚Äôt have any overdue tasks I procrastinated. (I think. I hope!)

I know exactly what I have to do tomorrow.

I have something to do tomorrow!

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a sense of purpose. Or anything even remotely resembling a routine. It feels really, really good.

Nothing super crazy is happening. I can actually relax for a minute. Try to slow down and enjoy myself.

For the first time, today felt like just another day. I can picture this all happening again tomorrow. And I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

It‚Äôs really soothing to be able to know what tomorrow will look like. Usually, it‚Äôs so hard for me to predict. But everything is starting to balance out.

Today feels perfectly normal. Like it could happen again tomorrow. Today was repeatable, which is the best thing a day can be.

It‚Äôs perfect.

No - it‚Äôs better than perfect.

It‚Äôs average."

I think I should clarify.

I‚Äôm not totally obsessed with F all day long. It‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm at home.

I don‚Äôt know why exactly. Well‚Äî I do, kinda. When I get to school I just kind of forget. People loosen me up. Talking really helps get out my anxiety.

And even when I‚Äôm in class some days, I could care less what he does/ says.

Not often though, but it does happen.

But its when I have to leave his presence for the day I just die a little. The times I do leave happy and perfectly content is when I know for a fact I will talk to him again soon.

I miss him.

I talked with Andy today about the whole F vs A thing. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. If I get the chance Monday I really want to talk to him about it.

I have so much art to make this week. Shit.

Three independent projects PLUS my power project.

Ahhhhhhhhh !!

It‚Äôs okay I know I can do it.

I‚Äôm ready for summer.

I want to dream tonight."

I don‚Äôt really have anything to say today, I just didn‚Äôt want to skip a day.

Today was pretty average. Had its ups and downs.

Nothing that needs to be remembered in detail.

Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just focus on the present and not be so stuck in my own head reflecting on the past.

I can‚Äôt help wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm annoying. He certainly doesn‚Äôt give off that vibe at all, but I wonder if he‚Äôs ever just like, Damn. I wish S wasn‚Äôt hanging around here after school again.

The last thing on the planet I want to be is annoying to F.

Yesterday went weirdly. I don‚Äôt remember quite what we said/did but I remember getting home and just wanting to cut so bad because of how stupid I was around him. I couldn‚Äôt find my blade anywhere.

I glued realistic eyes to the mannequin and posted it on my story during school. After I‚Äôd been home for a bit, he replied ‚ÄúüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÅ‚Äù which made me so happy I started crying on my bed.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I just really needed that. A lot. I no longer had the urge to cut. But I couldn‚Äôt find my knife anywhere so it didn‚Äôt matter anyways. Later that night I got desperate again and found an old blade in the toolbox downstairs. It was mine but I‚Äôd lost it a long time ago.

I didn‚Äôt make any new cuts really, just opened some scabs.

Which I really want to do right now.

But I want to write about my day. Not yesterday. Ugh. I can do all the scab picking I want tonight.

Today was a weird schedule. I almost ran into him in the hallway during lunch when going around the corner and he gave me one of the friendliest ‚Äúhey S‚Äî‚Äî‚Äòs‚Äù I‚Äôve ever heard. It just made me melt inside I felt so happy.

In 6th hour it was just me, L, K, J, and F. We talked and talked and jokes about things for almost the whole hour, and into 7th hour. We had a shortened schedule for yearbooks today.

During 7th hour we decided to try power washing the screens. And we did. I worked on it for a long time. Then took a break to get my yearbook at 1. Some complications happened and I couldn‚Äôt get it today.

Then I went back outside and cleaned some more. F joined me later for a while. Then we cleaned it up and took it back inside.

I love talking with him so much. So fucking much.

We were talking before I left and said something about what you call college professors, some go by their name some go by last name etc.

That got him talking about his own name. He says he doesn‚Äôt mind that people call him F. But he just thinks it‚Äôs weird because it‚Äôs not HIS name. He says he doesn‚Äôt care that much. But I could really tell he‚Äôd rather be called A.

I can‚Äôt imagine calling him A. No one else does it so it would be weird. I jokingly went OK, A‚Äî-. And it was SO weird calling him A.

I‚Äôd been wondering about this for a while now when I overheard him say something similar to someone.

I don‚Äôt really know how to go forward. F? A? Mr. F? I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd care if I called him A. He‚Äôd actually prefer it from his students instead of F.

I‚Äôm just so conflicted. I want to please him, but it would sound weird especially to my peers to call him A.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. If for some reason I have the chance Monday, I figure I‚Äôll be sneaky and be like, ‚ÄúHey, F‚ÄîA‚ÄîMr. F whatever, sorry, (insert question)‚Äù

Hopefully he will clarify things. Maybe.

I like calling him F. I think it works. But I understand where he‚Äôs coming from.

A.

A. F.

F?

Fuck.

Alex always calls him A. I thought it was weird but I always wished I had her confidence.

A.

A new start?

I don‚Äôt like it. But I love it.

A.

I don‚Äôt wanna go to work. I just want to sit here and complain. I hate weekends. I can‚Äôt talk to him for two full days. Two long days.

I won‚Äôt be able to talk to him all summer. Shit.

I just hope the last time I see him isn‚Äôt weird. I hope he‚Äôs not like, bye. And then gets distracted by something else. I‚Äôm gonna miss him so much. The seniors are gone now.

But I‚Äôm gonna miss him more than any of them combined.

My diary is so fucking embarrassing.

Today I have a meeting at Taipei.So I can take my son to his school by took bus with him.

I like do that.

I can discuss with him about any topic.

He is studying elementary school first year.

Not know too much word.

I told him when he learn a word,he should mark sure the step of writing the word.

He say ""We use rainbow color to show each step""

So I ask him,if the writing step word is more than 7.How about it?

He say repeat that again.

I say oh! I forgot it.

He likes to ask me the word that he don't know.

Chinese word sometimes like a draw.

Many words you can explain the meaning by separate it.

So I can show him why the word combine from others and the meaning of it.

Welcome back to our regularly scheduled programming.

We‚Äôre sorry for the interruption of happiness you‚Äôve been experiencing for the past few days.

We‚Äôre not sure where it came from, but we have our best working to solve the problem.

We guarantee it won‚Äôt happen again.

I started feeling like shit again out of nowhere sometime yesterday afternoon.

It didn‚Äôt even make sense.

I was having fun right up until I had a panic attack.

This shit‚Äôs so fucking frustrating.

I still had good moments. In a way that‚Äôs actually worse, because I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy them as much as I wanted to.

But at least they happened.

In the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm pretty lucky. Not everyone gets good moments.

I got to see a friend of mine I haven‚Äôt seen in a while. Catching up with her is always a great time.

Hung out with my housemates, which is always awesome.

One of them even taught me how to fly a drone!

I‚Äôve been so excited to do that with him for days.

But then when we actually did it, even though it went really well and I had a great time, I couldn‚Äôt get as excited as I wanted to feel.

Everything just feels sort of separated.

Like there‚Äôs a mostly transparent wall in between me and the world. But it tints everything grey.

The depression is back - and so is the anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, and whatever the fuck else is wrong with me. Even my physical health problems are acting up.

It‚Äôs really a party now.

Everyone was invited, and they all came. And they brought their friends!

Honestly, the worst part of having all this shit is how hard it is to figure out which one is causing my problems at any given moment.

It could be something as simple as the weather.

It‚Äôs greyer and rainier than it was yesterday. I‚Äôm still a person; not everything is related to mental illness or one of my many ongoing crises.

Who knows?

Maybe nothing‚Äôs wrong.

Maybe I just miss the sunshine."

Today my kids ask me to stay or play with them when I need to get off the house to my office as usual.

I must told them ""I have to work to make money for the family"" sadly.

I know the kids will not always stay with us too long.Maybe up to age of 10,they will have their classmates to play with.

My boys have weak body. I thought maybe because of I got a late marriage.

When I got first boy,I'm almost near by 40.

So the only hope of mine for them is grow up with healthy.Nothing else.

Every year my birthday I make a wish about safety and healthy to my family.

Any weird happen is normal in this world.You know why?

Today was a good day. We had the potluck.

I finished my book.

Talked with L.

Had a whole conversation with L and F about the future of the art show. Even the future of art classes at our school.

F posted a pic of my photographs to the insta.

When I asked when we would sit down and talk art club for next year, he said we could just think of idea during the summer and text. Something along those lines.

That made me smile. He doesn‚Äôt just want to ditch us over summer.

It really proves he cares.

Most every day I go through this cycle. I wake up, excited to go to school. To see F. To have the chance to talk to him, for him to smile at me. Anything.

I sit in the cafeteria and realize he‚Äôs too busy to care. To notice me.

I forget and move on with my day. Mildly depressed but okay overall.

I get to class and he‚Äôs either bland or in a great mood. Most days he‚Äôll ask me something or say something to me in class if I don‚Äôt.

I guess I just strive for those conversations. The ones we‚Äôve had after school. Or during class sometimes. I feel like I fit in some place when I talk to him. Like I belong, and am accepted.

I don‚Äôt know when or if I‚Äôll ever be satisfied.

I just wish I could understand his thinking. Get inside his head. See the world through his eyes.

I‚Äôm less sad about summer now, and I‚Äôm looking forward to next year and all the possibilities and conversations and adventures it brings. I‚Äôm beyond thankful I‚Äôm a junior. Ending things now like this would hurt me too much.

I just want to feel normal. I wish I weren‚Äôt so fucking obsessive over him. I sound like a lunatic. A sappy teenage girl obsessed with her mentor.

God I even dress like him sometimes. Even M thinks so. I could quote her.

‚ÄúYou dress like F but with glitter and jewelry.‚Äù

Thanks. Glad to know I dress like a middle class 40 something white dad. She‚Äôs not wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it hurts.

I need a fuckin reason to stay after tomorrow. Like ASAP. But I don‚Äôt really have any. Maybe I should just go home for once.

Go home and draw. Spend some of that F energy working on my projects. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll start a drawing tomorrow. I‚Äôll come in during seminar it‚Äôll be fine.

I have to leave for the orthodontist at 12:10. Hopefully I‚Äôll get back before or right after 6th hour starts.

Fuck I wish I had money.

I have a spending problem.

I don‚Äôt NEED a new sketchbook. I don‚Äôt NEED Dr. Martens. I don‚Äôt NEED all this shit. I wish I could reduce myself to nothing. If it means dressing like a white dad, so be it.

Same fucking problems all over again right?

I‚Äôm a mess."
0,"08.05.19. That feeling
You know that feeling when something hits you so strongly you can‚Äôt even react to it?

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called.

Not that it matters. I don‚Äôt think this feeling needs a name.

I woke up really early today.

Like, 4am early.

The first thing I did was enroll in a math course. Seeing the registration confirmed soothed something in me I didn‚Äôt even realize was there.

I think it‚Äôs just nice to have something to do.

One of my housemates is taking the same course. We‚Äôre going to the library later.

For better or worse, we‚Äôre in it together now.

By 5am, I was dressed and ready for the day. But it wasn‚Äôt ready for me yet - it was still dark out.

I went for a run around the neighbourhood until the sun came up.

I haven‚Äôt run in a very long time. It felt really good to feel the cool morning air in my burning lungs. My heart was beating in a good way.

It was still so early when I got back, I had time to take a nap so I could wake up with the rest of the world.

I crawled back in bed... well, ‚Äúbed‚Äù is a bit of an exaggeration. Right now all I have is an old mattress topper on the floor. My bed hasn‚Äôt arrived yet.

I lay on the floor, snuggled up under a cozy blanket and piles of trash I still have to properly unpack.

And I had the best sleep I‚Äôve had in ages.

By 6:15am I was tired of sleeping, so I got up again and decided to make breakfast.

Eating breakfast is another thing I haven‚Äôt done in a really long time. I made eggs.

While I cooked, I chatted idly with the guy who‚Äôs been crashing in our basement.

The smell of food always draws people out.

He commented on how I was doing the dishes by hand even though we had a dishwasher. I forgot we have a dishwasher now.

But I still did the dishes in the sink. I told him, ‚ÄúI want this clean NOW. And I don‚Äôt mind doing it by hand.‚Äù

He chuckled and said my other housemate said the same thing last night.

I guess we‚Äôre all still getting used to the new place and unlearning our old habits. But there‚Äôs a certain comfort in knowing all our instincts are in sync.

At 7am I found myself at the supermarket getting the groceries we forgot to get yesterday.

I stopped for coffee on the way there, and drank it as I walked in the sunshine. By the time I was finished drinking I was home again.

The kitchen was quiet, so I stayed.

After a few minutes, one of my housemates came down to make himself breakfast before work.

We‚Äôre already used to each other‚Äôs habits, so after a quick ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù neither of us felt the need for conversation.

There‚Äôs nothing better than quiet company.

Living here is so new, yet it feels so familiar.

What is that feeling? Does it have a name?

Does it even need one?

Now it‚Äôs only 8:30 in the morning. My other two housemates haven‚Äôt even woken up yet, and I‚Äôve already enjoyed an entire day.

And I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of it."

Hi Diary, it's been a long time since I have written anything. I am fine nowadays. Everything in my life is going well. I have been working in a software company and I love my job. I have great friends and everything feels nice.

A few months ago my college had finished and I thought that most of the friends would be apart from my life. I thought I have no use to be in there life. I thought lowly of me. But, even after 6 months passed almost all of my friends are with me. I have never been this happy in my life. Everything seems so perfect. I love myself too. After all, I am in love. Yes, I am in love.

I never thought I would love someone. I would fall for someone. I deserved someone. I have always tried to keep my choices aside and thought of what had to be done, not that what I want to do. Now that I have my life in a pretty stable condition, not on career or studies. But, my mind is stable. I want to tell you that no matter how messed up your life gets, if you are surrounded by good people, everything seems to be alright. I am so grateful to have my friends and family. I always wanted to be happy and now I feel like I have reached my goal. Now, I just have to stay here for the rest of my life. \^\^"

i been holding my feelings in due to pure laziness which damaged me even more. at my job ever since we had the self scan  installed, the supervisors been all over me for not watching when the light blinks when the customers need help or taking too long to help a customer. two nights ago my supervisor screamed at me because she said i overpowered her and that hurted because she never yelled at me like that or talked to me the way she did. the next day i was off and spent the day doing my schoolwork while being disconnected from social media. working so many days and hours made me resent everyone at my job. the minute i walk in the place im tired and ready to go.  My job takes all the energy from me. once i get home i never do anything fun except sleep. my bed is the number one spot for me.

I will be working at the swimming pool again this year so now i have juggle between my shitty retail job and school and now the swimming pool place. this summer will be a nightmare for me. I am already dreading it now.

i installed grindr and as usual no one responded. i could go for a cuddling session with a guy and no one wants to do it.  I hate myself.

i have to muster up the strength to write my budget down. I am sick of overspending so i want to set a budget for shit. i never done this so wish me luck.

i have a coding app that i also want to check out when i am reloaded with energy. Coding would be a good side hustle for me.

i gotta clean my room. it smells. what the fuck??

I am mentally sore from all the bitching by my coworker. i forgot to mention another coworker snapped when someone took her newspaper. totally unprofessional.

i need to get strong and be an asshole because people love to shit on me. when i bring the asshole side out they will not wanna be around me. hell ill have to start being extra sassy. i dont need to respect authority when they are ungrateful.

I left my family today and went back to school.

I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to anyone.

Not even the kids.

I just left.

My dad made someone who works for him drive me back and help me move in. No one told me that was the plan; I had a train booked.

I found out when a stranger showed up with an old blue pickup truck at 9am and told me to get in.

Driving for 3 hours with a total stranger and all of your belongings is weird, to say the least.

Weirder when your dad is his boss.

But it ended up being pretty fun. He was a nice guy. Even told me the name he picked for his baby, who‚Äôs due this June. (Or was it July?)

He said he knew he could trust me to keep it secret.

Said the same thing right before he started telling me what it‚Äôs like to work for my dad.

He was right both times.

I can keep a secret.

After I moved in and he left, I got really stressed out.

I couldn‚Äôt connect with my housemates, who had already been living in the new place before I arrived. I felt like an alien posing as their friend.

I felt so out of place.

Being in a brand new house with no plan and no schedule was really overwhelming.

There were a lot of details to work out. I wanted to blow it all off and get high.

But I didn‚Äôt.

I couldn‚Äôt - I got rid of all my drugs, and even my pipe.

Instead, I wrote a list of things I needed to do. I made an action plan. I realized it wasn‚Äôt as overwhelming or impossible as I thought. And I felt better.

Then the rest of my housemates got home.

I‚Äôm so grateful for them.

We spent all night together, just hanging out and catching up and getting drunk.

Writing it out, it sounds so basic and unmemorable.

We got groceries.

Made dinner (tacos!!).

Did vodka shots and chugged cheap wine.

Put on throwbacks and danced around the kitchen.

Chatted, caught up with each other.

Moved all the shit out of the basement. The tenants before us had some weird stuff down there.

I stopped feeling out of place pretty quickly.

We laughed so much.

We were so comfortable with each other.

We spent hours late into the night just enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

At one point, our new housemate said, ‚ÄúMy life is so much better now that I‚Äôm living with you guys.‚Äù

I responded, ‚ÄúWe feel the same way about you.‚Äù

And I thought: I‚Äôm home."

I only have 12 days left in class. 12 days with my friends. One day left with my senior friends. 11 classes left with F...

Then I‚Äôll be away all summer. No goofs to cheer me up. Just me. Alone. I‚Äôll make friends at camp of course, and my sister will be around sure, but no F for months.

He‚Äôs like the light of my school life. He makes school worth coming to. Directly and indirectly. All I‚Äôve ever longed for is to be accepted and admired by people. Not everyone of course, but the people I admire. And there isn‚Äôt a person on earth I admire more than F. He‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôs got the perfect job. Perfect wife. Perfect kids. Perfect humor. Perfect aspirations. Perfect in his words. Perfect in everything. Perfectly UNperfect.

And he notices ME. He TRUSTS me. He knows one of my greatest secrets. He laughs at my jokes. He likes my art. (I hope.) He cares for his students. He‚Äôs created an amazing classroom/environment for us. He‚Äôs amazing. He‚Äôs just so perfect. I wish I were him. I wish I were able to become him.

And that‚Äôs why I dread summer. In a way. This man I‚Äôve obsessed over every single day for almost the entirety of my junior year will have no contact with me for three months. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll end up emailing him, or messaging him. Or he‚Äôll do the same. But it‚Äôs not the same. Not at all.

The only thing keeping me going is that I‚Äôll be able to post things on Instagram. Social media is the only thing keeping me held together over the summer.

Anyways.

I asked him about AP today. I asked if I could do my breadth and concentration over the summer in addition to my summer assignments. We talked and worked most of it out. He said that it was fine. I‚Äôm a unique case anyways. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of work, but I‚Äôd have to do it regardless. I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into that again. I‚Äôll just get stressed. I still need to finish my DBQ for US History.

The potluck is tomorrow! I‚Äôm so excited and sad. I‚Äôm sad to see all my senior friends leave. But I‚Äôm excited to spend quality time with them one last time. I‚Äôm thinking about writing some little letters and sticking some coupons to my work in a little envelope and give it to them. It might be kind of cheesy though. But they‚Äôre close and they won‚Äôt think that. (I hope.)

I made a layered banana pudding. It took me like two hours from the time I got off work to the time I finished. I made one for school and one for the house. It looks and tastes so good. I‚Äôm so proud. I sure hope F likes banana.

But today was ok. Better than I thought it‚Äôd go. I woke up with a pretty sore leg. It doesn‚Äôt hurt so bad now ‚Äî unless I smack it or something. I thought it was a lot of cuts when I did it. But not I‚Äôm not so sure. Only 60ish. Which is more than I usually do. But they don‚Äôt look bad. They‚Äôre just dark and solid. They don‚Äôt look bad yet, or still. Just some limbo state.

I can‚Äôt wait in two days for me to be able to cut the scabs all off and bleed again. It‚Äôs not that I want the pain. It‚Äôs not about that at all. It‚Äôs just about peeling scabs. I‚Äôve always loved doing that ever since I was small. I still do. But differently of course.

I really don‚Äôt want to do my DBQ but I should.
I‚Äôm gonna finish the questions tonight. Shower in the morning. Then write the essay before I get ready. I can‚Äôt afford to turn this in late. I‚Äôd fail the class.

Tomorrow is gonna be a good day. I‚Äôm going in with lower expectations but you never know.

I should probably just do the questions in the morning. That way it‚Äôll be fresh in my mind.

I‚Äôm going to lay in bed and examine my scabs.

Count them properly maybe. I don‚Äôt usually count. I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll stop that here and now.

But I want to touch them.

And drift into sleep.

And hold my leg like my dying child.

The dying child no one knows who‚Äôs terminally ill because pants exist.

Only one person knows. (Two, but she doesn‚Äôt count) F know. But does he know? I hope he didn‚Äôt think that was a one time thing. But why wouldn‚Äôt he? My email said it was the last time I‚Äôd ever do it. That I‚Äôve quit. Why would I lie?

He trusts me. Doesn‚Äôt he?

I dream that I could show someone. Show him. Just for a few moments. Obviously it‚Äôd never be acceptable to do that. I‚Äôd never dream on doing it in real life.

But I can dream can‚Äôt I?

I‚Äôm so fucked in the head. I‚Äôm so creepy and obsessive. I hope to god no one I know ever finds these. This subreddit is growing more active every week. It used to be only be and one maybe two people.

If it gets too popular I guess I can delete my posts. I‚Äôll save them for sure. For myself.

So future me can read this. So future me can look back at her mistakes with a sad smile. Realizing how far she‚Äôs come.

Hey you. What‚Äôs up?"
0,"Is someone reading this?
Dear Diary, is everyone I know reading you? It seems like someone‚Äôs playing a prank on me. I write something in here and the next day someone tells me or does something that is just too fitting to what I wrote.

The other day I wrote about a crush and that same crush seems to look at me more or be careful around me. I wrote about how I admired someone and that person seemed to talk to me more the next day. I wrote about how I didn‚Äôt like someone and the next day they knew exactly how to push my buttons. Is it just some placebo effect that makes me paranoid or are the people in my life reading my entries and giggling to themselves about how pathetic I am?

Who‚Äôs reading this? Who the fuck are you?"

today i called the ambulance for my mom again

its not uncommon or weird nor something to be feared.

She has severe COPD which makes it very difficult to do every day tasks it also doesn't help her that shes depressed. tonight was average but after she left my uncle stated that she would die i commented nonchalant not tonight. It wasn't until i thought back to the other times where she could have died that's when i became upset. all my life its been like this i am the one you have to fall onto because no one else is there, i am the one who has to call the ambulance because you cant pull yourself together. And yet you treat me like every one else.. like shit. You wonder why everyone in our family has left you its because your garbage. i feel like disowning you but your also all i have i hate you but i love you with all of my heart.
it's painful to see whats happening to your life.
from your perspective it must be so hard to continue to live when you lost everything im just glad you're strong."

Another day. It came crashing down bad for a bit. But only because I chose to do that.

I hate school.

I should clarify, I hate core classes. History, Science, Math, English. I can‚Äôt stand it.

The only reason I have for going to school is my art classes, and when they don‚Äôt go well, I feel like absolute shit.

I got caught up with my other book. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. I reread a lot but I‚Äôm almost glad I did. I would have read my other book but it looks too angsty and depressing.

Art went meh. I tried my copper etching using sharpie as a realist. The sharpie came off in a lot of areas when in the ferric chloride and left weird marks everywhere. The print didn‚Äôt turn out well. F said it was okay because it‚Äôs kind of a cool effect. Just not for what I‚Äôm trying to do. Later after an uneventful class, (HENRY CHOPPED OFF HIS HAIR BTW) I was talking to F about failures and stuff. He said to look at failures like something I‚Äôve learned. The whole Edison quote and everything. I told him J agreed with him completely, but that I was just frustrated because I don‚Äôt have enough time to fail. He couldn‚Äôt really argue with that.

Oh and he said he liked my shirt. Yayayay, I wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd notice, but sure enough he did! I knew he‚Äôd like it. Even when I bought it. It‚Äôs something he would totally wear if he wore button down shirts.

I wanna buy more noww

Ahhh.

My brain is a mess. I drove home with R after school. She lives so close it would be stupid to wait for my dad.

When I got home I told my dad about this stupid city tour we had to do for history.

It took us like 2 hours. It was interesting though.

I‚Äôm so tired rn. I don‚Äôt feel like writing for once.

I‚Äôm just gonna look at shirts I can‚Äôt afford right now

I need to cancel my Spotify subscription

shitt
update: I totally forgot to mention I cut up the shit out of my right thigh. It was bleeding a whole lot. I got home after R dropped me off and I just needed to punish myself for being so dumb around F. I wish I weren‚Äôt so emotional.

I haven‚Äôt cut this MUCH in a very very long time if ever. But I‚Äôm doing fine now.

I just feel super disappointed"

In the morning, the journey(over 1 hours) to my office in the bus I looked the e-book from r/FreeEBOOKS,I choose [The Time Machine](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35/35-0.txt).

I don't know how long I read it, then I slept. Although I like Sci-fi novel but it still make me slept.

Because I'm not enough to read it in English. I had a book about time traveler in Chinese. It's very appealing me.

The most good thing is we have a brain to think.

When I was a student, I don't know ""why I come to this word?"" A big question right?

At that moment I thought 30 years old is enough for me.

But now, after got kids I think I need to survival more to grow up them.And after got master degree,I wonder what will happen in the feature? Fly car? Go to space? Destroy cancer?

More technology make people convenient. But how about the pollution that we also made.

The food we eat was full of chemical material,even fish also has plastic particles.

Few weeks ago,I attend a speech about ""environmental protection"".

The speaker told us there are only 7 kinds of turtle in the sea. If we don't take action to protect them.The environment will more hard.

Think about this I don't know what kind of world that we will transfer to our next generation.

Everyday I check my kids face,they are naive and curiously.Ask me, hey daddy if the butterfly has tail how will it become?Hey Daddy if I feed a frog will he know me when he grow up? @@"

Here are some of my nightmares.

(Just in case, TW: suicide and sexual assault)

...

The one I have most often starts off as a regular dream.

At first, I never even realize what‚Äôs coming.

It‚Äôs never exactly same, but usually I dream I‚Äôm having a normal day.

Until something goes wrong, like it always does. Then it just keeps getting worse. And worse.

And worse.

The saddest part is, nothing in the dream up to this point is made up. I just have each of my real life problems bubble to the surface, one by one.

Then, all my worst fears start to come true. Things I won‚Äôt bother describing here, because they‚Äôre the kinds of fears personal to me.

But if you want to get in my shoes, think of who you‚Äôd be if you had nothing.

Actually think about it as you read. Make my nightmare your own.

Think of everything you‚Äôd have to lose to make life no longer worth living.

Think of the horrors you‚Äôd have to face that would be so unimaginable that you couldn‚Äôt live with them.

Think of all the nightmares you can‚Äôt even imagine. Try to imagine them.

Think of what kinds of sins you wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with yourself for committing.

I promise I‚Äôve been thinking of mine, too.

Then think of yourself right now.

And imagine the descent from who you are right now to who you‚Äôd become as all those things happen.

A person - you - turned into an empty shell of who you once were, broken beyond repair.

Imagine the way it feels to lose everything. To experience something that goes beyond your threshold of bearing.

Imagine the people closest to you being tortured to death.

Imagine watching.

Imagine hearing their screams.

Imagine hearing them turn into silence.

Imagine doing nothing.

Imagine *choosing* to do nothing.

Imagine trying to live with yourself after that.

Imagine whatever you have to until you feel the kind of despair that would be impossible to recover from, if it were real.

In the dream, it‚Äôs all too real.

I run into the bathroom and pull out a gun.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure from where; I don‚Äôt even own a gun in real life. I also don‚Äôt know why I would keep it in the bathroom.

I put the gun in my mouth and stare at myself in the mirror.

Watch the terror and tear-stricken expression on my face turn to despair, then eventually nothing at all. I keep eye contact with my reflection the whole time.

Once my eyes glaze over completely, I pull the trigger.

Nothing happens.

The gun is loaded and working. I know because I check every time. Sometimes I‚Äôll even shoot the mirror. It always shatters with a bang.

But no matter how many times I try, nothing happens to me. It doesn‚Äôt even hurt. The bullets just pass right through.

I don‚Äôt know if the dream implies that I can‚Äôt die, or that I‚Äôm already dead and in hell.

Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

To me, those are the same.

...

I have another nightmare that starts with me on trial for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit.

The crime is never directly stated, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs awful. The worst crime anyone could possibly commit.

I‚Äôm found guilty.

I swear it wasn‚Äôt me, but no one‚Äôs listening.

My friends and family shun me in disgust.

They each come to visit once, for closure.

They come to stare me in the face and tell me how horrible I make them feel that they fell for my lies and thought I was worthy of even being called a human being, let alone their friend.

All I can do is say I‚Äôm sorry.

The media writes me off as a monster, so the whole world hates me.

My face is in the newspaper- I know because someone sends me a copy with my eyes crossed out and awful sayings etched across the top.

Eventually, I go to jail.

In prison, I‚Äôm kept in solitary confinement, in a tiny little cell filled with all the things I‚Äôm most afraid of.

Each day, they come to torture me in all the worst ways. Show me what I deserve for what I‚Äôve done. Show me no mercy.

I scream and cry and beg and plead for them to stop, to please just listen, that I swear it wasn‚Äôt me.

But it never matters. Everyone knows I‚Äôm pure evil; the kind of person who would say anything to escape.

Wouldn‚Äôt anyone, in that situation?

Not that it matters.

Nothing stops it.

Eventually, I give up trying.

They always say pain gets better once you accept it. But that‚Äôs a lie.

The pain gets worse once I stop fighting it. Once I know it will never end, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.

Sometimes when I wake up, I can still feel it.

...

I don‚Äôt often dream of being raped anymore.

But I used to, every night.

Those dreams never tell a coherent story the way my regular nightmares do.

Like the memories themselves, they rip through the rest of my dreams in violent, chaotic fragments.

They never last for more than a split second. I only get moments frozen in time.

They‚Äôre almost more like pictures than living, breathing dreams.

Pictures you can feel with every fibre of your being.

They say in dreams you can never see hands. I don‚Äôt know who says that. It‚Äôs a lie.

Their hands are always the clearest part.

They‚Äôre wrapped around my waist to pick me up.

I‚Äôm too little to stop him. Not that I would have - I was too young to even think about it.

I can feel his fingers dig into my sides as he sets me down gently, onto him. I can feel him go into me.

But I can‚Äôt even focus on that, because I‚Äôm laughing too hard.

He‚Äôs tickling me with the fingers that are still gripping my sides.

I can‚Äôt catch my breath enough to tell him to stop. But why would he? I‚Äôm grinning and giggling, having a ball.

How can you laugh while being raped? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

Then suddenly I‚Äôm pinned against the bed, a different boy‚Äôs hands pressed into my back.

His whole weight is on me.

I can‚Äôt breathe.

In the dream I can‚Äôt feel him inside me at all.

I only know we‚Äôre having sex because of how the bed is shaking.

I‚Äôm gripping the sheets. They‚Äôre blue plaid. Cotton. Smell freshly washed.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder what detergent he uses.

The sheets are pressed right up against my face. That doesn‚Äôt help with the whole not being able to breathe thing.

I‚Äôm gasping for air.

But his weight is too much. I can‚Äôt even move enough to get words out. I couldn‚Äôt tell them to stop even if I tried.

Not that I tried.

All I can feel is his hands on my back. Pressing so hard they‚Äôre like knives piercing through my lungs.

Then everything goes black.

And suddenly I‚Äôm six years old again. Back on his lap.

This dream usually just keeps looping, fragment after fragment. There are more, but just writing this made me feel sick.

It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not like I need to write them down. I know exactly what happens.

It doesn‚Äôt end until something wakes me.

I rarely wake up on my own. Sometimes in movies a character sit up suddenly in their own bed, sweating and panting and glad that it‚Äôs over.

But not me.

I‚Äôm trapped in the nightmare.

...

I‚Äôm not excited to sleep tonight."
0,"The goofy loop and other things 04/01/9
I had a small, very small, tiny, wee drink last night and the birds are singing right now and I feel vile.

Drinking has been unfun for the most part this year. It was good up until July when the loopy painkiller fiasco began.

The other night I was talking to my friend about the goofy loop.

We were talking about the You show I'd been writing about last time and how everyone has a story of a guy like that.

I read once that magicians are able to pull off such elaborate tricks because people just don't think a magician would bother to go to all the trouble. They underestimate what other people are willing to do.

Like Dynamo walking on water when he's really walking on submerged plexiglass.

You just don't think someone would bother. That's how I feel about the stalker in that show.

In real life I assume nobody cares enough to do such convoluted things.

But in reality if some mentalist out there fancied those things it would be so easy to gain information about someone through their social media etc. Does Snapchat need a map? Really?

You best believe there's tape over my webcam.

Another wild thing is the Data Protection Act. Bear with me.

How many times have I collected a parcel from a store with my name and address on it, and wholeheartedly trusted the person behind the counter to do nothing bad with my details?

I forget bad intentions exist outside of Florida and the House of Lords.

Anyway the goofy loop.

In a traumatic situation, a person can shut down and get stuck in a cycle of a repetitive action. Their brain leaves the building.

Like when a police officer keeps shouting 'Put your hands up' or 'Put your weapon down'

Even though the person they're asking is clearly too norty and not listening.

Or when a group of men tried to pull Zibby Allen from Small Town Dicks into their car.

After they let her go she just sat on the floor, anticipating their return and doing nothing.

Didn't call the police. Or anybody at all.

Didn't get in her car and drive home. Or lock the doors at least.

Just sat there on the ground in the car park. Waiting.

How strange is that?

Anyway here I am hungover talking about assaults. I am putting myself back to bed. Goodbye."

Today is going quite well. I'm feeling okay which is a good thing. I had a tasty and filling lunch. I haven't eaten any sweets! This is a new one for me. I've been trying to end my toxic relationship with junk food and it's going surprisingly well.

I've been listening to music a lot today. I've also watched some YouTube videos and done a ton of work. Not everything went smooth but that is how things go usually.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have been thinking a lot about my mood swings. In my last entry I mentioned that I'm feeling hyperactive. Those episodes are quite frequent for me. My psychiatrist said I likely wasn't bipolar but it's still something we're investigating. I'm thinking that this might be actually true. I've been noticing more and more about myself. A diagnosis itself will not change anything for the better but I'll be able to start treatment. Or am I hypochondriac?

may, 06, 2019.

   i would usually use my finsta to post all my sad diary type of stuff but i deleted all my social media due to a mental health break and reddit is all i have. i was doing pretty okay for a while, almost a month of not being so sad. i've been feeling this way for almost as long as i can remember. my earliest memory of telling someone about me feeling this way was when i was about 10. i told my mom that i was depressed and she responded with ""you're too young to be feeling depressed, you can't be. you should'nt have anything to be worried about"".

   with the removal of my social media it has improved my mental status quite a bit. i realized that i dont need to post/prove anything to anyone because no one actually fucking cares if you're at a cool place or if you're having fun. no one cares, no one cares, no one cares. no living soul on my social media actually fucking cares about what i post or what i do with my life. no one cares. after i deleted my social media the only one that noticed messaged me was my sweet sweet bean, my male best friend that i talk to whenever i have something going on in my life. we'll refer to him as bean.

   no one else really noticed. because no one actually cares. bean has been there for me through almost everything this past year. he's been with me through my heart break, through the months that i actually lost myself (i'll probably talk about that in another entry.) but yeah, bean is almost always there for me. might be cheesey, but i love him. i love him for actually caring about me. i've has crushes on him from time to time but i know that we'll never be a thing, so i'll love him in secret. well, i've told him i love him but i dont think he thinks that i actually mean it, but i do. i love him platonically.

  i deleted my social media april 5th, 2019. prior to that i pushed people away. i told the girl i was seeing that i couldnt see her anymore and that broke her heart, how do i know? she told me. i broke down two days after a party i attended. i actually started hearing voices that weren't mine telling me that no one cared, everyone hates me, your friends are only there because they pity you, etc. thats what led me to deleting my social media, instagram, twitter, snapchat, and even facebook, fucking facebook.

  i felt okay for a while and what helped me feel better were the plants that i bought back in april. i think the plants i bought were a big part of me feeling better. they make me happy even though they just sit there and look pretty. it started out as three now i have eight plant babies. i plan on buying more as soon as i have money to spend. green is my favorite color and seeing the plants i have grow make me even happier.

   okay, well this is getting pretty long and i havent really talked about why i wrote this today, i'll talk about it briefly and then let whoever is reading this go. i felt down again for no reason today, i was folding my laundry and listening to music and it just it me right in the face out of nowhere. my chest became heavy and the tip of my nose started to get warm, like i was about to cry. i have absolutely no reason to feel this way nor cry like the baby that i am. i want to get better and im trying my best but these punches of sadness come out of nowhere and its a heavy burden. i've been avoiding seeing medical help even though everyone tells me to, but i think its getting to the point where i'm actually considering it. thank you to whoever read this whole thing. i expect no one to, as i only wrote this to get some of this feeling off my chest before i start bawling my eyes out. okay well, bye."
0,"Liking someone is kinda cool.

I‚Äôm thinking of making a playlist about love soon. I just like waking up knowing I‚Äôm gonna see someone I like seeing and I‚Äôd like something to accompany it. I haven‚Äôt had a crush for years now so I‚Äôm trying to make the most of it while I can, before we leave and it fades. It always fades. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing though because recently this crush has really been putting a dent in my heart. Knowing they like someone else yet wanting to reach for their hand just a foot away is painful.

The other day they said I was going to be great. I think they noticed I was having a panic attack and I really think I was, for real this time. I actually cried on the ride home. But they said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be great‚Äù and that was the best thing I could ever hear, but I still wanted to cry. After I left, all I kept thinking was what if I disappoint you or them or everyone or myself? What will happen then? I cried and cried and tried to hold it back as much as I could for the people looking at me, but it was that kind of crying that felt like you were swallowing shards of glass when trying to hold it back. Either way after they said that, I really felt like maybe I could be ok.

I got home and cried and slept, but I realized I wasn‚Äôt going to implode. I was ok. I was going to be great."

Another post.

Just cut my foot on a needle sticking out of my backpack. My toe is bleeding. I should wash it so it doesn‚Äôt get infected.

I don‚Äôt feel like it though.

I just sat outside for an hour working on covering my new copper plate in sharpie. I wanna try using that as a resist.

And I did some thinking. Some realizing about my future.

I just need to be thankful. Thankful for what I have.

F said something very profound to me once. He said that he doesn‚Äôt know a single artist who makes their living solely off of making art and selling it. He doesn‚Äôt personally know a single artist who just makes art all day long in their studio, and people flock to buy their art. The world just doesn‚Äôt work that way. He says that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to have a real job. One that connects art is best. A job that allows you to make what you love on the side.

But he never really had to think about that. He said he‚Äôs always wanted to be a teacher, since he was in elementary school. From the get go he‚Äôs taken child development classes, and just about every art class in high school. He‚Äôs always known what he‚Äôs wanted to do it seems like.

I wish I could say the same. I wish I could see my future now. I don‚Äôt want some grand life. It‚Äôs just not practical. Rich people are always so busy. Always doing so much.

Personally I wish I could just keep it simple. I wish I could just buy a trailer. One of those ones you can drive around on the back of a truck. I just need a bed, kitchen, table, bookshelf, and a space for my clothes and storage.

And I‚Äôd be happy. I could personalize it all I want, just living a quiet life. Whenever I get sick of the city I could just go park it out somewhere remote and just breathe. I don‚Äôt want a fancy job. I don‚Äôt know how to get one of those.

I need to save my money. I spent my whole fucking Paycheck in one weekend.

I need to cool down.

I gotta pay for college somehow. And I have 12$ to my name.

I wish I was small. Like a mouse. I wish I could shrink my room. My self. I want to be tiny. I‚Äôve always had tiny imaginary friends as a kid. Now I wish I could be them. I want a closet fort.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll make a closet fort.

My own tiny space.

For me."

It‚Äôs been such a food weekend. Wednesday onward has just been absolutely amazing. Every interaction I have with people has been above and beyond great.

I feel happy. For more than a day in a row.

Probably just a string of lucky days, probably won‚Äôt get this again for a while. I just hope the crash back to reality isn‚Äôt too hard.

I‚Äôm trying to be nicer to myself. I really am. It‚Äôs helped me a lot, but every day I still have urges to cut because it‚Äôs all I know now. I don‚Äôt want to. I do though.. ugh. I wish I could just be normal. I wish my emotions didn‚Äôt sway every three days. I wish the cycle would break. I just want one. Not both. I want to be continually happy, or continually sad.

Anyways, today was pretty great. Woke up. Went to church. Did the usual. Anne, Ali, P and I went to a local art fair in Brookside.

We got lunch at Panera because it‚Äôs the only place we all like though it‚Äôs hella expensive. Anne met us there and we carpooled with her. None of them had ever been to an art fair. I was really surprised. I thought everyone had been to one at one point in their lives or another.

Most of the art was lame, as usual, but each row had at least 5 or more interesting enough booths to walk into. Towards the end I discovered an amazing one. I started fangirling big time. It was an artist who made absolutely stunning lithographs and etchings. I‚Äôve never seen prints that beautiful with my own eyes. The colors were perfect. Everything was so well crafted.

I want to be like him.

I really do. I just keep going back on forth on what I love. Sometimes it‚Äôs meticulous ink drawings. Sometimes charcoal, sometimes random shit. Sometimes block carving or screen printing. But lately it always goes back to plain old drypoint etching.

I wish I had a style. I need to narrow it down a lot more before I finish my portfolio. WHICH REMINDS ME... I only have till December 1st to finish my portfolio for art school. I‚Äôm only a junior. I need around 20 pieces. I need to be making professional work NOW.

I need those fucking scholarships. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get them.

I need rules. Rules for me. Rules to make a body of work that looks like my work. Or at least what I want it to be.

Rule one: My portfolio can‚Äôt look like the rest. They don‚Äôt want to see 15 portraits of my friends and family. I‚Äôm no chuck close, and neither are they quite frankly.

Rule two: I need to diversify, but not too much.

Ahh screw a list of rules. I just need a list of ideas.
OR. I‚Äôll start on my AP portfolio early?

Update: I just re-read the AP studio art summer work list on our google classroom. And OHhh boy. I‚Äôve got a lot to do. I need to start now.

I need to finish my AP portfolio an entire semester or so early. Jesus. Ok. This is a lot to think about.

So shit... I want to talk to F about this. I should do some research first. Ahhh fuck. But I want to finish etching a plate tonight so I can stay after school tomorrow.

UGHH. MH LIFE IS A MESS. Fuck I need to think."
0,"05.05.19. Hangovers
Today I woke up at 6:45am on my friend‚Äôs couch after a heavy night of drinking.

I felt INCREDIBLE.

Most people don‚Äôt like hangovers.

My friend who I was staying with was hungover too.

She woke up when her alarm went off at 10:30am.

Went straight to the kitchen and chugged a glass of water.

Then she groaned and went to the bathroom.

Staggered out a few minutes later, visibly dreading being awake.

She was so pissed when I pulled open the curtains to let the sunlight in.

Hangovers are just different for me.

Weirdly, I never feel better than after a night of heavy drinking. I know that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs supposed to happen. But I always wake up feeling energized and alert.

I was up with the sun this morning. Felt so truly happy and at peace, for the first time in so long, that I thought I was still dreaming.

The first thing I said was, ‚ÄúYour couch is so comfortable! I‚Äôm pretty sure I had the best sleep I‚Äôve had since coming home!‚Äù

My friend thought I was nuts.

Truthfully, so did I.

But the energy and brightness kept up all day. Even after I got back home.

Physically, I feel shitty now. After all, I‚Äôm only human.

But I almost always feel shitty. So most of the time I don‚Äôt even notice the difference.

Huh.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really get affected by hangovers.

I‚Äôm so used to the symptoms by now, I rarely even notice them unless I try - and why would I do that?

But mentally, nothing feels as good as waking up hungover.

My head feels clear. The ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù has totally gone away. I was cheerful and chatty all morning.

And I finally got to put ‚Äúgood‚Äù into my mood diary. It felt SO good to hit the smiley face button. And to see that little yellow circle break the blue/grey streak.

I feel more like myself - my old self - than I have in a very long time. I can‚Äôt remember how long it‚Äôs been. Maybe even longer than since last March.

I always forget that this happens until it does. But now that I‚Äôve noticed it, this is not going to help stop my budding drinking habit.

It probably wasn‚Äôt the drinking alone that did it.

I also got to see my old friends, who I always enjoy spending time with. I‚Äôm really comfortable around them, they‚Äôre lovely people.

And I got to go out! Downtown is a hell of a party scene where I‚Äôm from. Nothing like the town where I go to school. The clubs there are awful.

Last time I partied here, back when I was still sexually active, a guy offered me coke if I fucked him.

I didn‚Äôt, but we made out and groped each other a bit.

What can I say?

I‚Äôm a sucker for a good beard, and he felt the same about short skirts.

I actually forgot that happened until my friends reminded me last night.

Reminiscing with them, and getting to update each other with all our new stories, is always so much fun. They‚Äôre really great people.

Nothing like that guy happened last night.

I didn‚Äôt want to be hit on, so I wore a giant sweater and high-waisted jeans. Plus, I‚Äôve gotten chubby. Nobody looked twice at me.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I was so relaxed.

Or maybe it was all the shots. We did a lot of shots. Or at least, I did.

I did more than everyone else, because I couldn‚Äôt have any beer. So people just kept buying me shots so I wouldn‚Äôt feel left out.

I guess even an autoimmune disorder has its silver lining.

I‚Äôm really grateful that my friends helped me find the bright side. My sister and I have been really upset about the potential diagnosis. Last night helped me keep things in perspective.

But the point is, going out when I‚Äôm home is a lot of fun. My friends are fun. Drugs and alcohol are definitely fun.

My good mood could have come from a good time.

But, I really think it was the alcohol. And the edibles.

Since I haven‚Äôt had any weed in days (since I had to leave it back at school, ugh), my thoughts have been racing non-stop. That, combined with my shitty home life, was really getting me down.

I didn‚Äôt even realize how awful I‚Äôd been feeling until I stopped.

God, I love drinking.

Weed is my drug of choice, for sure. I like it more than all the others. It does everything I need.

But weed makes me think more. It makes your neurons fire up. Which is great when I need to just disconnect from the world for a while.

But alcohol does the opposite. It turns all my thoughts off. Lets me just be here.

For a few hours, I was totally present. No anxiety- not even in the big crowds while clubbing. No worrying about the past or the future or even the present. No sadness, no numbness, no overthinking.

Last night, I got to be 19 years old again. I got to have a night of reckless fun. I got to just be alive.

And when I went to sleep, I could. No staying up thinking. No bad dreams. No anxiety or feeling unsafe, even though I wasn‚Äôt in my room. I got to fall asleep worn out with joy instead of tears.

In the morning, I did get a bit anxious about all that. It made me feel guilty to have that much fun.

I didn‚Äôt have a single panic attack or flashback or anything - not even in the big crowd. I didn‚Äôt get tired of socializing after an hour. I didn‚Äôt have to leave early. And I slept so well.

Does that mean I made everything up?

It‚Äôs confusing, because I like being better. I want to be better. I‚Äôve been trying really, really hard to get better.

But then when it happens, I freak out. It feels like it happened too fast to be real. So, I must have faked ever being sick in the first place.

Which is crazy, because it‚Äôs been over a year now since this all started. I feel like I‚Äôve been miserable forever. How can I just forget all that suffering in just one night?

Not to mention all the work I‚Äôve been doing.

It‚Äôs not like I just got better out of nowhere. I‚Äôve been trying as hard as I can. But that feels like a lie, too, when it actually works. I don‚Äôt know why.

I also can‚Äôt help but wait for the other shoe to drop. That feeling of doom is always there, even if alcohol makes it quieter.

I think it‚Äôs just that feeling safe and ok is so unfamiliar to me. Usually, it just means something bad is about to happen. So whenever I feel like this, it really messes with my head.

Also, sometimes I start to worry that if I feel too good, then I won‚Äôt need help anymore.

It makes me scared to think about losing what little support I have right now. Once I‚Äôm better, I‚Äôll be alone again.

That thought makes my stomach hurt.

Or maybe it‚Äôs just the hangover.

Hopefully by the time I‚Äôm better I‚Äôll really be better, more than I ever was before. That way I won‚Äôt slide back into bad habits and end up like this again.

I never want to be this way again. I‚Äôll do anything to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen.

But if my biggest worry for today is that I feel too good, I‚Äôm fine with that.

I almost never feel like this - I‚Äôm gonna ride this wave until it hits the shore.

And when all the alcohol and exhaustion leaves my system, hopefully I can stay like this, with my mind nice and quiet.

But if not, at least now I know what to do about it.

I love hangovers.

...

Update:

Today ended up being a really good day.

Two of the kids barged into my room not long after I got home, while I was still brushing my teeth.

Kids don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre hungover. Luckily, neither do I.

The baby was taking a nap and the others were out of the house, so I got to give the seven and four year olds some special attention.

First we played hide and seek.

The older one is a nightmare to play with; she always finds a way to vanish off the face of the earth.

Today she somehow managed to worm her way into the tiny crevice between the couch and the floor. I didn‚Äôt know anything could fit under there, let alone a child!

I never would have found her if not for the giggling.

The younger one doesn‚Äôt have quite the same natural talent for disappearing, but she does her best.

Today she hid right behind me, where I couldn‚Äôt see her. She made sure to grab the back of my shirt so she could stay hidden in case I tried to turn around.

Then, just to be certain she‚Äôd found the ultimate hiding spot, she told me, ‚ÄúPretend you don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm here!‚Äù

So, at least she‚Äôs self-aware.

Later, since it was such a nice day, I took them to the park. We even took the dog.

To show how grateful he was, he decided to help keep the park clean by eating all the trash he could find.

But he‚Äôs just so cute, I didn‚Äôt have the heart to get mad at him. I just pretended not to see. I‚Äôll make one of the adults deal with it when he pukes it all up later.

It was gorgeous out today, bright and sunny.

We played robber because, as the older one kindly pointed out, ‚ÄúYou look like a criminal.‚Äù

Robber is a pretty fun game, though, because it ends with the kids jumping on me and tackling me to the ground.

I get to give them lots of hugs and kisses as we lay in a big dog pile.

The kids played for about 15 minutes before they got too hot and started fighting.

Despite that seemingly short time, we were out for about an hour.

Tired kids + walking in the heat = a very slow trip home.

I mean, that‚Äôs just basic math.

So we took breaks in the shady spots we found along the way.

Each break we found worms or ants or cool rocks. Who knows? Maybe they even learned something. (But that‚Äôs probably just wishful thinking on my part.)

We made it home, and their grandparents had come to visit. They brought a scavenger hunt, so the kids are busy now, and I can hide away for a bit before bedtime.

I just wanted to write this down before I forget the little details.

Because they really do grow up fast, and I‚Äôm gonna miss a lot of it while I‚Äôm away.

I took a couple pictures of them throughout the week, but most of the time when I‚Äôm with them I try to put my phone away.

They deserve some undivided attention.

They‚Äôre really, really good kids.

I love them so much.

...

Second update:

I played soccer with the kids and helped them ride their bikes until the sun went down.

Then we went in and had snacks before bedtime.

When it was time to go, I told the four year old that she could have one more sip of milk, and then she had to go.

That little smartass chugged her glass and held as much milk in her mouth as she could, eyes wide and cheeks puffed out.

She figured if she never swallowed her last sip, she could stay forever and I‚Äôd never make her go to bed.

I tricked her into swallowing the milk by asking her a question that she‚Äôd have to speak to answer. By the time she realized what I‚Äôd done, it was too late.

Also, me and the baby had a full conversation in babble talk. I have no idea what he got from it, but he was grinning like a madman the entire time.

I hope I didn‚Äôt tell him anything incriminating.

Honestly, being home is exhausting.

But even though I‚Äôm overworked and under appreciated here, I can‚Äôt help but keep doing it.

I love them.

And I‚Äôm really grateful today was a good day."

I was hoping it wouldn't rain today so I could go on a walk as I did yesterday. For some reason I'm feeling like I'm in a sort of mania. I can't control my thoughts, I can't focus and my behavior is very much odd. I'm happy that I'm able to spot these but it doesn't help. The only thing that helps me in situations like that is going to bed and trying to fall asleep. I do dumb and regrettable stuff in moments like this. This entry is short because I can't focus on anything today.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have been talking with S yesterday a lot. I'm still not sure how I'm feeling about it.

Dating as a gay man is quite hard. There are a lot of obstacles that I seem to be unable to overcome. I have no idea how to proceed with my dating life in general."
0,"04.05.19. What if things never get better?
Today started off like any other day.

I woke up and immediately wished I hadn‚Äôt.

Fuck, I hate being alive. I feel so trapped here. Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I even CAN die.

Sometimes I have dreams where I kill myself and nothing happens, because I‚Äôm already in Hell.

I used to not believe in an afterlife. Now, I‚Äôm too afraid to think about it. What could possibly be worse than this?

I try so hard to get better. Every single day. And sometimes it works, for a little bit.

But it never holds up. Something else always goes wrong eventually.

I‚Äôm just so tired.

I‚Äôm tired of hoping and being let down.

I‚Äôm tired of trying and failing.

I‚Äôm tired of finding the courage to speak up and being ignored. Or having no one around to even hear.

I‚Äôm tired of opening myself up to the world just to be filled with more hurt and sadness and despair.

I‚Äôm tired of having to keep getting back up again.

I try to keep telling myself it gets better. It has to, because I can‚Äôt live like this forever.

But I don‚Äôt know if it actually does.

Does it?

Every day I choose hope, because it‚Äôs the only thing that gets me out of bed every morning.

The people who don‚Äôt want me dead also don‚Äôt want to deal with me when I‚Äôm too depressed to function. So I have to get out of bed. I have to try to get better.

But I don‚Äôt even know if I can.

I don‚Äôt actually KNOW that things get better.

That‚Äôs just something I tell myself, because that‚Äôs what supportive people say to the main character in books and movies. And it helps them get back up again and win, so the story has a happy ending.

I‚Äôve never had anyone tell me things get better.

At my lowest, I‚Äôve always been alone.

When we were making my suicide safety plan, my counsellor asked me what I wanted.

She said everyone has things that make being alive easier, and we just have to find mine, so I can find her motivation to live.

I told her I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm a very privileged person. There‚Äôs never been a single thing I couldn‚Äôt have if I just asked for it.

When I was in the hospital, my parents asked me what I wanted. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything.

So they brought me a laptop. A stuffed toy. Books. A hairbrush. Soft pyjamas. Pictures of my siblings.

My dad always says: ‚ÄúAnything for you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the oldest story in the world.

My parents gave me everything.

But at night, when I was scared and hurting, all I had to hold was a hairbrush and a new laptop.

I was surrounded by nice things.

But the nicest things in the world don‚Äôt drown out the bad thoughts or ease the pain.

I learned to cry silently, because sometimes they drugged the patients who made too much noise.

The only reminder I got to stay calm came from the Velcro straps dangling off my bed‚Äôs guard rails.

You did *not* want a person to come remind you.

I‚Äôd seen what they did to the patients who forgot.

It often involved the straps.

When my counsellor asked me what I wanted, I told her I didn‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve never really wanted anything. My parents gave me everything I‚Äôve ever asked for.

She asked me what I wanted.

I‚Äôve never had another person stick around when I‚Äôm in pain.

I‚Äôve never had anyone hug me when I cry.

I‚Äôve never had anyone tell me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Usually, if anything, they tell me it‚Äôs not.

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is for someone to notice when something‚Äôs wrong.

No matter how bad things get, people will only give me exactly what I ask for.

But what happens when I don‚Äôt know what to ask for?

My cousin once had a psychotic breakdown and pulled a knife on my grandmother.

We couldn‚Äôt have her committed for longer than 72 hours. Since she was an adult, she would have to go voluntarily or sign away her rights to someone else.

But she was so delusional, she couldn‚Äôt even see that she had a problem. So she wouldn‚Äôt go.

It was like being back at the hospital - legally, our hands were tied.

But we knew that even though she was too sick to ask for it, she still needed help.

People will help me if I ask for it.

They‚Äôll do exactly what I tell them I need, nothing more and nothing less. It‚Äôs a blessing to have people who are willing to help.

But sometimes, I‚Äôm too sick to notice anything‚Äôs wrong until it‚Äôs too late.

Sometimes I don‚Äôt even know what I need.

And sometimes, I just don‚Äôt know how to ask.

When my counsellor asked me what I wanted, and I told her I didn‚Äôt know.

But I do.

I know exactly what I want.

I just want someone to give me a hug and tell me that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.

Because sometimes I need another person to believe it for me, when I feel too hopeless. And sometimes I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to deal with all this all alone.

Sometimes I just want proof that someone cares. I know they do. But sometimes people make it really hard to remember.

And I want them to stay with me for as long as I need, without me having to ask. Just because they want to, because they want me to feel better.

I wish there wasn‚Äôt always a time limit on my pain.

I wish someone didn‚Äôt care how long it took.

But I couldn‚Äôt tell my counsellor that.

Because it‚Äôs embarrassing.

Because then she‚Äôd ask me who I want it to be.

And I don‚Äôt know.

Because there‚Äôs no one I can think of who would do that. Even if I did ask.

Plenty of people care about me. They really do want to see me happy. But no one wants to see me sad.

How can I be happy if I can‚Äôt be sad?

I can‚Äôt remember what we ended up putting on my suicide safety plan.

Not that it matters. It didn‚Äôt help.

Will anything help?

I really, really want to get better. But I‚Äôm afraid that I can‚Äôt. Because the thing I want isn‚Äôt something I can have.

Alright, I think that‚Äôs enough sitting around being sad for today.

I guess this is just one of those days that feels hopeless.

It‚Äôs ok, I know it will pass. It always does.

It feels hopeless right now, but I know that‚Äôs just a feeling. I know it will get better once I stop sitting around pitying myself.

And even if it doesn‚Äôt, I have to pull myself together. It‚Äôs Saturday night - I have plans later.

Tonight I‚Äôm going clubbing with my friends.

I‚Äôm gonna get wasted.

...

Update:

My mom said, ‚ÄúIf you go out tonight, don‚Äôt bother coming home.‚Äù

So guess who‚Äôs staying out all night! üéâ

I asked my friend if I could crash at her place tonight, hopefully she gets back soon. Otherwise I‚Äôll just bar hop until morning, lol.

This day has really turned around! I knew it would."

I am so salty.

I have to take a shower and figure out what the hell I‚Äôm gonna wear to accept my trophy for my fucking basketball poster.

UGH. I don‚Äôt even want to go. No one I care about will be there. I‚Äôm embarrassed. My grandparents want to come to this stupid fucking fair.

What if Audrey‚Äôs there? What if she sees me go up on stage and accept a trophy  for A FUCKING SCHOOL BASKETBALL POSTER. How embarrassing.

I‚Äôm a failure.

BUT I CAN DRAW WELL. I just don‚Äôt draw large.
Or meaningful.

OK SO I JUST FOUND OUT I HAVE TO LEAVE WORK AT 1:15. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

IM A MESS.

I need to shower and get ready now. I‚Äôm a stupid fucking failure."

I've started the day with a power walk and some exercise. I felt better afterwards. I've always negated the need to exercise on a daily basis. While I'm still skeptical, I'm inclined to try it and see how things go. So far so good!

I'm hoping to improve the condition of body in general. I'm beginning to pay more attention to my skin. I've been moisturizing and exfoliating regularly and I'm already seeing improvements.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I've been thinking a lot about therapy last night. While there are certain aspects I don't like, I do think I'm getting the help and attention I need.

The relationship between me and my therapist seems quite mysterious to me. I'm not used to talking about myself so much, especially when I know nothing about the other person. Therapy is challenging and I like challenges. I'm willing to continue.

I've been making best efforts to understand the therapeutic process as a whole. Not only that but also how the mental health system works. I want learn what options I have and what could be best for me.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I'm still talking to the S guy. He seems to be kind and honest. I don't  what I should do next. Do I ask him on a date? I'll have to think about that a little bit more."

I am so tired.

I got an award at the show.

But it was the fucking basketball poster.

THE FUCKING BASKETBALL POSTER.

Is my art shit?

My art must be shit.

I got home after work and watched that new twilight zone series by Jordan Peele. Then suddenly I got really angry.

I was angry at the judges for not picking my drawings. Mine were good. I am looking forward to going tomorrow and seeing who the fucks art won.

So I only work like 6 hours tomorrow. I won‚Äôt complain about that.

But I was so angry. So I started a drawing out of spite. I got out of bed, looked at myself in the mirror, and told myself I‚Äôm fucking amazing and I don‚Äôt care if anyone gives a shit now because I‚Äôm still growing. But I‚Äôm gonna be the fucking best.

I got my big drawing board I bought today with the large pad of paper and just started drawing trees. Tons of trees in a Forrest. Wonky looking trees. Like a night scene from the xfiles almost.

After like 40 mins of drawing I got a massive headache. I took a break and went to the bathroom and got something to drink.

Then I read. Just read and read. I‚Äôm on page 197 now. I started it last night. I‚Äôm proud of myself in a way. I miss reading. I used to be such a book nerd.

The last thing I want to become is a book nerd. I just want to be smart. And I know for a fact that reading is my missing element.

I can‚Äôt wait to finish my fucking masterpiece of a drawing. It may not be conceptually advanced. But it‚Äôs gonna be so beautiful. So detailed.

I‚Äôm gonna pass out now."

Today was fine.

I woke up in a mood, probably because I was worn out from all the screaming and crying of yesterday. My eyes still felt puffy when I woke up.

I took it out on the kettle as I made some tea to deal with the exhaustion and brain fog.

How dare the laws of physics make me *wait* for the water to boil instead of heating up to the perfect temperature instantaneously? That‚Äôs 3 minutes of my life, gone forever!

I recently got a mood tracker app, and today I finally had enough logs for it to show me my mood chart. It‚Äôs almost entirely made up of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, with little spikes up and down here or there as I remember to log them.

But today felt pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

Most days nowadays feel pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

I can‚Äôt remember when the last time was that I had a day I just enjoyed, all day long.

Being alive has just gotten so exhausting. I‚Äôm over it.

There are moments that I like. There are plenty of things that I appreciate. And there are people that I care about enough to not kill myself.

And I‚Äôm still hopeful that I can make things better if I try hard enough. Really, really hopeful.

But most of the time, I could take or leave this whole ‚Äúbeing alive‚Äù business.

I don‚Äôt mind being here anymore. Most days it‚Äôs not the hellish nightmare that it used to be, not long ago.

But I wouldn‚Äôt mind being hit by a bus, either. I‚Äôm cool with whatever.

My mom has been extra clingy all day, which isn‚Äôt helping. She‚Äôs said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every five minutes. It‚Äôs SO annoying.

She followed me around all day, kept knocking on my door and asking me if I need anything. Honestly, all I want is some space.

I actually had to go out for a walk for a few hours just to get away from her.

That ended up being alright, despite the weather.

I found a tree fort in the sketchy part of the woods my mom always tells me not to go near because of all the girls who get murdered there.

The fort was full of blankets and empty beer bottles. It was the perfect shelter from the rain. I carved my initials into one of the trees and then stayed for a few hours to read my book.

The book I‚Äôm reading is really good. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúDaisy Jones and The Six‚Äù, and it‚Äôs just the kind of book I needed.

Eventually, I went back home. My mom continued to be unrelenting. Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll go back to the tree fort with my own beer bottles.

Oh wait - forgot I can‚Äôt drink beer anymore. Stupid fucking celiac. Autoimmune disorders suck.

Fine, I‚Äôll bring wine. Who cares? As long as I can drink. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot lately.

I‚Äôm used to a certain amount of alone time now, and I find it really difficult to deal with people who infringe on my space. My mom never used to be one of those people.

But today she was all over me. It‚Äôs weird.

I think she‚Äôs trying to repair our relationship, or make up for, like, 19 years of shitty things she‚Äôs suddenly found she has to forgive herself for.

I wish it would go back to when I was in charge of fixing things. I‚Äôm much better at it. She‚Äôs just making things worse. But I can‚Äôt even be mad at her, because she‚Äôs trying. Ugh.

I‚Äôm already over yesterday. I forgive her, as always. I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôve learned how to move on quickly. But she still cares, a lot.

I don‚Äôt expect her promise to change to stick (she‚Äôs made similar promises in her past on the rare occasion someone - usually me - makes her confront her own behaviour), but it was nice to know she really doesn‚Äôt mean it. That helps.

But like... can she deal with her own emotions without dragging me into it, please? LOL. I already know she can‚Äôt, so I tried to be sensitive. I said ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù, even though I didn‚Äôt really mean it and hate saying it.

She asked me to sleep in her bed with her after last night. What the fuck? Honestly, it‚Äôs kind of pathetic.

I guess she just didn‚Äôt want to sleep alone after last night, since my dad‚Äôs gambling in Vegas this week.

I feel kind of bad that I said no, and left her with all those emotions. She probably could have used some comfort. But I left her alone with the guilt instead.

But then I had a memory, of when she got the phone call from my school after I was found with the pills.

She called me into her room. Told me what the school told her. That I was suicidal and planning to act on it, and this was considered an emergency.

Then she broke down crying and said: ‚ÄúWhy would you do this to me? We gave you everything. Now they‚Äôre gonna think I‚Äôm a bad mom.‚Äù

And I had to hold her while she cried. When she was done, she sent me to my room.

She left me alone with that guilt, too.

She never even asked me what was wrong. What had made me suffer so much that I would take my own life at only 13, when I was still just a kid.

So last night, I thought to myself: She‚Äôll be fine.

And I fell asleep.

I think I‚Äôve run out of sympathy for my mom.

What am I gonna do for Mother‚Äôs Day? I‚Äôll have to do something extra nice after this blowout or it will crush her. And she apologized, so she deserves something to make her feel special.

But my heart‚Äôs just not in it.

I haven‚Äôt done anything big for Mother‚Äôs Day in years.

I tried a few years ago.

I learned origami, Spent an obscene amount of time making 52 paper stars. Each one had a little handwritten note on it, with a compliment or a memory or something. I put the stars in a nice jar.

When I gave it to her, she said: ‚ÄúNice. Trash in a jar.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúThey have notes inside. You can open one every week for a year, until next Mother‚Äôs Day.‚Äù

I showed her by opening one. Gave her the note. She read it, then crumpled it and dropped it somewhere.

Then she said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet.‚Äù

Then she locked eyes with me and dumped them all in the trash.

Kept the jar, though.

I haven‚Äôt bothered with Mother‚Äôs Day since. Usually I just give her a hug and tell her I love her. Or I get her a nice card.

My dad always gets her something, so I figured it was fine.

But last year she started complaining that we never get her anything. She wants something to make her feel loved.

I can‚Äôt help but empathize. I feel the same way.

I won‚Äôt even be here on Mother‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôll be back at school by then. So theoretically I don‚Äôt have to do anything. I have the perfect excuse.

But I‚Äôll feel bad. I have to do something. And it‚Äôll be easier since I can just leave it here for her and won‚Äôt have to be here to deal with her reaction.

The problem is, I‚Äôve kind of stopped caring about everything. I‚Äôm completely apathetic.

How am I supposed to express the kind of love my mom needs? I can‚Äôt even feel it."

This is a first one for me.

For the last couple of months I‚Äôve been terribly lonely, sad and anxious. I think the decline in my overall mental wellbeing has been going on even longer, I just didn‚Äôt notice it as much. After experiencing a loss and a painful breakup earlier this year, it hit me hard.

I started to look for help, I knew I needed it. Making the first move and actually scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist was quite hard but I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve managed to do it. I was prescribed medication and I‚Äôve been going to therapy for 3 months now. Things are slowly getting better for me in terms of dealing with anxiety and negative thoughts but there is still a lot of work to do.

I‚Äôve been thinking of starting a diary like that for a moment now. I feel like this could potentially help me better understand my thoughts and feelings.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Ever since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend I was torn between jumping right back into dating and taking a break for myself. I tried to do both but I‚Äôm yet to have any success with the dating part.

Meeting new people is hard, especially when you‚Äôre socially anxious. I‚Äôm unable to pick up any cues which makes things even more complicated for me.

This week I started talking to a guy (let‚Äôs call him S) I seem to be compatible with in terms of values. While we disagree sometimes, the conversations are surprisingly engaging for me.

S is the kind of a person I‚Äôd usually avoid but there is something interesting about him. I‚Äôm curious to see where things go.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôve been changing a lot lately. I‚Äôve started to take care of myself more. I‚Äôm exercising, I‚Äôm thinking of getting a tattoo.

When I was younger, I thought that I‚Äôd grow into a certain person and remain that very same way for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm starting to see that I‚Äôm constantly evolving and that this process will never stop.

I‚Äôve also changed my mind about my past by far. I‚Äôm not ashamed of who I was anymore."

OH MY GOD.
TODAY WAS AMAZING.

I went in to F‚Äôs room this morning to drop off my art for the show and get a seminar pass. He was super cheerful. I had my hot chocolate, and overall now I was in a great mood.

Took a math quiz, got along with Gib and Brooke well. Then I went to seminar. It was fun. F matted my work and I made tags for them. I asked him some questions about the show this weekend and apparently it‚Äôs all on Saturday this year and not Sunday. So he can‚Äôt even make it at all saturday. And neither can I unless I get an award and can ask off from work. I was kind of bummed out about that.

English went well. Lunch was fine. F walked by me and river when we were eating in the hall, and again as we were walking to English. 6th hour was pretty boring. I was watching this really interesting video on books and how to read more throughout your daily life. I got super inspired and want to start my own collection. First on my list is to buy a bookshelf. I found one for 30$ at IKEA. I want to buy my own copy of Art and Fear, and a few others like Tom Robbins etc. I want to order books online now.

As class was ending I tried to be helpful and ask F if he needed any help with the art fair stuff. He had SO much to hang up and I felt so bad for him. He‚Äôd be there all night hanging it up alone. I secretly wished I could come along and help. And then the bell rang. River and Logan came in and we talked for a bit. I asked F again if there was anything I could do to help. Then he was saying he just wished he had help hanging it up. I said I‚Äôd help, Logan chimed in and said he‚Äôd help too. Then F asked us if we could come along to help. OMG I was so excited!!! I said of course, I‚Äôd love to. I texted dad and he said it was ok. Logan ended up riding with his mom there so it was just me and F in his car. I wasn‚Äôt very talkative at first, but I loosened up.

But sitting in that car. I‚Äôve rode in his car a few times before for different things. Collab, the radio show thing, imagine that, etc. It wasn‚Äôt totally weird. But that feeling. Just two pals going to hang up some mother fuckin art. Hell yeah!! We talked about middle school, we talked about Ira, we talked about Zoe, we talked about lots. It was only a 10 min drive but it was great. When we got to the school we went in to scope out what was happening, when we got up to the door he art teacher there propped it open and said they were ready for stuff. So we walked back out to the car to grab the art. There was an art teacher who only wore Hawaiian shirts we talked about. And we talked about how he talked to our principal about having a gallery space just like the school we were at now. We talked about the M mall. About M and some of my childhood memories there. We set our stuff down on a table. Logan met us in the gym. F had him sort art into categories while I went back to the car with him to grab some more paintings.

And we hung up art. Pretty simple. I had to run out to his car to grab a sheet of paper with names on it. I unlocked his car. It was weird. But I felt trusted. He really does trust me. It means the world to me. I know the password to his laptop, and now I‚Äôve got the keys to his car in my hand. F trusts me. :-)

So we hung up a lot of stuff. Lots and lot. 145 pieces to be exact. Alex C showed up while we were hanging up some of the last stuff. These two art teachers were getting on our cases about spreading stuff out, when we were doing a perfectly fine job. Even F thought so. They were so annoying. I told Alex how thankful I am we have F. She agreed. We kind of bonded a bit. She‚Äôs super nice. Shes one of the few IB seniors I get along with well.

When we finished we walked around for a bit and looked at all the art as a group and talked about what we thought would win awards etc. it was really fun. I got to be really frank and so did F and it was interesting to hear him talk about student work. I kinda get the feeling he doesn‚Äôt like art for the sake of art. Like a big technical drawing of a subway for instance. I agreed with him, but I still thought they‚Äôd get awards because that‚Äôs what the classes teach anyways.

He was surprised there wasn‚Äôt more darkroom photography from other schools. Apparently none of the teachers really know how to teach it. I am SO thankful for F. He is so amazing.

When we were leaving I asked him if he could drop me by school on the way back. He said sure! Then when we were getting in the car I called grandma because I was going to her house regardless. Zoe answered and just realized mid-call that grandma only lives like 4 mins from school. I asked F if he would be okay with dropping me off at my grandmas. I figured it‚Äôd be okay to ask since he offered to drop me off at my house earlier. He said he‚Äôd be happy to. So we headed off towards grandmas.

We talked about sleep, and getting up in the morning, and a whole myriad of things. It‚Äôs so great just to talk to people like that. One on one. And especially him of all people. It was just nice to have time to talk with him right before the end of the school year. He thanked me multiple times for helping him hang up stuff. I said I was happy to help! I really do enjoy helping. I just want to be useful. The last thing on earth I want to be is a bother. Then we pulled up to grandmas. I got out of the car and thanked him for driving me. Zoe and grandma were looking out the window and Zoe was waving to me. Apparently as I was walking in, F waved to Zoe. He‚Äôs hilarious. A real riot.

Grandma made the most awesome casserole. And the most heavenly pudding. I took a few photos and videos and posted them to my story. Some birds, and the pudding etc. We sat outside for a bit and I asked grandma if we could go to Barnes and noble. She said sure. So we went!

I bought 3 books. Grandma bought my fourth. I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy one more. But my direct deposit goes in tomorrow morning so it should be okay. I am literally so excited about books. God, they‚Äôre so amazing. So crisp and beautiful. I want to start a bookshelf. I want to do my room!

I‚Äôm gonna start saving. I need to start saving pretty badly. Tomorrow I need to buy that drawing board though. I think I‚Äôm gonna save up all my money till camp. I really wanna do my room. So bad. I just wanna paint and get those desk/shelves.

Oh so the books I got were, Jitterbug Perfume, by Tom Robbins. Even Cowgirls get the Blues, by Tom Robbins. The Road by Jack Kur‚Äî- and shit. Nope I bought the wrong book. I wanted On the Road. Not the Road. FUCK. Whatever. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine. And last of all, Girl in pieces. I first saw the book and thought the charcoal lettering looked really cool. Then I was reading the synopsis and it said something about scars. There was a red line on the back that looked like a cut but not really. I thoughtI was seeing things. Then I flipped the book over and realized the words were crossed through with red slashes. This is a book that deals with self harm I guess. I considered buying it, then I thought about, what if dad or someone else looks at it? What if ZOE sees it?! She‚Äôs the only one at home who knows about my self harm (kinda.) But I bought it. Because I really wanna read it now.

I‚Äôm excited. Today was amazing. More than I could have ever asked for. I can‚Äôt wait to start living MY life.

Things are going to work. And work well."
0,"02.05.19. I‚Äôm an idiot
Today started out alright.

I woke up home alone because all the kids were already at school. Played with the cat, hung out for a bit, took a depression nap on the basement couch, lost track of time.

Eventually I got bored and lonely and sick of sitting around pitying myself. So I called my mom.

She‚Äôs been better lately. Not a lot, but a little. And I‚Äôve been better lately, too.

Since I gave up expecting anything from my parents, now I can just ask them for exactly what I want when I want it. As long as it‚Äôs not too much, they‚Äôll usually do it, and our relationship has improved significantly because of this.

So I called my mom, and today she picked up.

She said, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúAttention.‚Äù

She said, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll be home soon. I‚Äôll come down.‚Äù

And I said, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

And she said, ‚ÄúNo problem, baby.‚Äù

It was all so nice.

My mom did exactly what she said. She came down once she got home and snuggled with me on the couch for a few minutes. It was awesome. She even made me grilled cheese after.

Things were good.

I guess that‚Äôs why I let my guard down.

My mom went out again later, and I went out too. I went for a walk in the park, and played with strangers‚Äô dogs, and wasted time on my phone.

When I‚Äôm home, I like to spend the weekdays alone and/or out of the house. Occasionally I even hang out with friends, as long as we go somewhere. As long as I can escape for a bit.

It helps me get ready for the evenings, when everyone gets home. That‚Äôs when things tend to get messy.

Even though I try my best to enjoy my days off while I‚Äôm here, that sense of impending doom follows me.

So I wasn‚Äôt thrilled when I noticed I had an email. I got that familiar pit in my stomach when I saw it. An email, like everything else in my life, is usually bad news.

Was it my new landlord, with another problem with my banking info or a form I forgot to sign?

Or was it school related - my accommodations assessment was cancelled or rebooked, I missed a tuition payment, something went wrong with my appeal, or anything else?

Was it a friend or classmate or fellow club member, angry at me for missing something important?

Or was it my aunt, who the restraining order didn‚Äôt go through for- was she stalking me again? She started with emails last time, too.

Or who knows? Maybe it was a new crisis; something I couldn‚Äôt even imagine yet.

Really, it could be anything.

I groaned inwardly and made myself click the email icon to see what disaster was hiding behind that little red notification bubble.

It was from the local animal shelter.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. What could this be about?

I clicked on the email. I read the first few lines in confusion before I put the pieces together.

Months ago, right when I was first starting to pull myself out of my massive depressive episode, I had applied to be a volunteer at the animal shelter.

I figured I‚Äôd be a decent applicant: I love animals, I had experience working at a vet clinic in high school, and now that I was on medical leave, I had lots of free time to volunteer and a very flexible (read: completely empty) schedule.

I hadn‚Äôt expected to ever hear back from them. Demand for people who want to spend time hanging out with adorable animals is significantly smaller than supply, unsurprisingly.

But here in my inbox was an email asking me which date I was free for training.

The position I‚Äôd been chosen for?

Cat cuddler!

Sometimes, dreams really do come true.

That‚Äôs when I made my first mistake.

I yelled for my mom.

Things had been so good all day. And our shared love of cats is one of the few things we bond over. It didn‚Äôt even occur to me to worry about telling her.

I called her name, once, to see if she was even home.

I heard her yell back from her room, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

So I raced over and knocked on her door, grinning and bouncing where I stood as I waited for her to come out.

She opened the door and took one look at me and snapped: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù

I froze.

She continued, snarling, ‚ÄúWhy did you scream like that? Look what you did to me! Feel my chest- you gave me heart palpitations! Jesus, what is such a big deal that you feel the need to run over here screaming like some sort of animal? I thought the house was burning down!‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I made my second mistake.

I felt my smile fall off my face, and forgot to hide my hurt as I stared at her in sadness.

I didn‚Äôt mean to. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting that reaction. But it never matters what I meant to do.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal,‚Äù I backtracked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! I was just excited about something. But you ruined it- I‚Äôm not excited anymore. Never mind, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

That was my third mistake. I attacked her.

I forgot I‚Äôm only supposed to use ‚ÄúI statements‚Äù.

Then I tried to leave. I felt like such an idiot. My moment of happiness was gone. I just wanted to go back to my room and be alone again before I made things even worse.

But my mom hates thinking she did something wrong. She wasn‚Äôt going to let me leave until she was certain she did the right thing as a parent.

‚ÄúTell me what happened right now, I swear to god! Why do you torture me like this? You can‚Äôt just say you got excited about something and then not tell me, that‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù

So when I slumped my gaze to the ground and muttered, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt want to tell you now. I‚Äôm not excited anymore,‚Äù she lost her mind.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôd better tell me now, after what you did to me,‚Äù she hissed, grabbing my phone out of my hands.

Fourth mistake. I grabbed it right back.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I snapped at her. ‚ÄúI got a volunteer position at the animal shelter, but I don‚Äôt want to tell you about it if you‚Äôre gonna make me feel like shit!‚Äù

I stormed back to my room. My mom followed me, yelling all the while. I wish I could remember exactly what she said, but I tuned most of it out.

Once she‚Äôd gotten all the yelling out of her system, my mom was pretty excited about the job.

I knew she would be. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to cuddle cats? Like any good mom, she wanted to talk about it.

But my mood was completely ruined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore! I want to be alone now. Can you please just leave me alone?‚Äù

My mom did not like that one bit.

‚ÄúWhat, so that‚Äôs it? You tell me about this and then you won‚Äôt give me any details? Why, because I ‚Äòyelled‚Äô at you? You‚Äôre so sensitive. Can you honestly never let things go? I only yelled because YOU made it seem like there was an emergency! Why do you always act like such a child?‚Äù

I lost it.

‚ÄúGet out of my room get out get out GET OUT NOW!‚Äù

She rolled her eyes in disgust.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a fucking brat. You always overreact.‚Äù

But then she finally left.

I locked my door, fell onto my bed and burst into tears.

How had I gone from elated to a temper tantrum in the span of literally two minutes?

But even as I asked the question I knew the answer.

I should have known better than to try to share it with my mom.

I never tell my mom any sort of news right away. She needs to be told in a very casual, non-committal way, significantly after the fact.

She‚Äôs like a bloodhound sniffing out fear. And joy. And everything else.

I didn‚Äôt tell her that I got accepted to every university I applied to until four months after the last letter came in.

I didn‚Äôt tell her when I got my period until I accidentally bled through my pants while we were at dinner.

I didn‚Äôt tell her about my first kiss until my sister made a joke about it and my mom overheard.

I didn‚Äôt tell her I wanted to kill myself until she got a call from my school saying they‚Äôd found the pills.

I knew better than to tell her about this.

It‚Äôs just an animal shelter- it didn‚Äôt even matter. It wasn‚Äôt worth it. But I forgot, because I‚Äôm such a stupid idiot. I thought things were getting better.

And now my little bit of brightness for today is spoiled.

Why am I such an idiot?

I was really excited about this. Now I don‚Äôt even want to think about it. Now it‚Äôs not even about me or my happiness at all. It‚Äôs about my mom, and everything I do wrong to make her so upset all the time.

I knew better. I never raise my voice or talk about myself at home. Why did I do that today?

Later, she came back and made me apologize for yelling (both times) and for making her feel bad.

She grilled me with questions and I had to tell her all the details even though I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. I just wanted to forget the whole thing.

Sharing it with her didn‚Äôt feel the way I thought it would. Somehow, it made my good news feel bad.

Eventually, she was satisfied. She left, and a few minutes later came back with the cat in her arms and a big smile on her face, wanting to hang out.

But I couldn‚Äôt enjoy spending time with her any more, even though she was giving me attention. I just wanted her to leave me alone.

I didn‚Äôt bring it up or say anything. But I must have acted more subdued or something, because she rolled her eyes and sighed and said, ‚ÄúReally? You still can‚Äôt let this go?‚Äù Then left in a huff.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what I say or do now. If I don‚Äôt act perfect - or even if I do - she‚Äôll bring this up forever. And then, ironically, say I‚Äôm the one holding a grudge.

I ruined all the progress we were making. And I acted like a child. And I got overemotional, as always.

Why did I think this would go well?

I‚Äôm such an idiot.

...

Update:

My mom kept bringing it up all day, even after I got over it.

Eventually, I lost my shit.

We got into a really intense screaming match that lasted an hour.

When she was done yelling, she said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done here. Get out.‚Äù

I went back up to my room to wait until she was ready to come upstairs and make me apologize and give her a hug and guilt trip me until I begged for her forgiveness and told her how much I loved her.

I gave up. I lay in bed and started to cry.

I thought about all the times this had happened before.

I thought about all the things I let go to appease her.

I thought about how she was never going to change. That none of this was ever going to change. How unfair it was that I had to just accept this.

But then!!!

I changed my mind.

I thought: *I don‚Äôt accept this anymore.*

It‚Äôs not fair that she can just make me cry whenever she wants. That I have to bend over backwards and walk on eggshells when I already do so much here.

It‚Äôs not fair that she can just take away my happiness whenever she feels like it. Do you know how hard it is for me to find happiness?

Twice in one day. I managed to bring my mood up, to focus on the good, to enjoy life as much as I could.

And twice in one day, as soon as she saw how happy I was, she stuck a pin in my balloon until I deflated.

She didn‚Äôt even ask where I had been when I got home, or what I was doing that had been so much fun. She didn‚Äôt care how my friends were doing. Or how I was.

It‚Äôs not fair that she can do that whenever she wants and still feel self-righteous about how she handles things.

I thought: *I don‚Äôt care if she changes anymore. I just want her to get it.*

So she at least knows what she‚Äôs doing.

If she‚Äôs going to hurt me, I want her to see it so clearly she can‚Äôt deny it.

I thought: *I‚Äôll never be able to accept this if I never even try to change it first. I have to try, at least once.*

I went back downstairs.

I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually not done.‚Äù

And I burst into tears.

I almost never cry in front of my mom. She started off irritated. She rolled her eyes and got that disapproving look on her face.

Voice dripping with bitterness, she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still mad? Really?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bother trying to tell her for the billionth time that I was never mad.

I just asked her: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you even care that you hurt my feelings? All you care about is that it‚Äôs not your fault, even when it is!‚Äù

And we got into another screaming match.

But I kept crying.

It was stupid and pathetic and the dumbest hill to die on, but I didn‚Äôt stop being sad just because she told me to.

I kept crying more with every nasty insult, every dismissal, everything she did to hurt me and make me think I was crazy and do what she wanted.

I kept crying until she could see that she was the one causing the tears.

I let her see how much she hurt me, even though I hated it and felt like the world‚Äôs biggest idiot and just wanted to give up like I always do so it could be over.

But I didn‚Äôt give up today.

It took a long time. I let her yell and scream and berate me until 1am. And I yelled and screamed right back.

But THEN!!!

SHE GOT IT.

...And it only took 19 years.

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what was said. (I was kind of preoccupied.) And I‚Äôm skipping a lot of the details I do remember because they just don‚Äôt need to be on the internet.

But I remember the moment it changed. She leaned against the kitchen counter and put her head in her hands.

And she said, genuinely: ‚ÄúOh my god. Maybe *I‚Äôm* the reactive one!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help it- I laughed.

Then she got this look on her face. I‚Äôll remember it forever.

And she asked me, ‚ÄúHow often do I do this?‚Äù

And I sobbed, ‚ÄúAll the time. My whole life. I can never tell you anything or do anything right.‚Äù

Then she started crying too. And she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

My brain skipped like a scratched record.

I stopped crying.

Then she gave me a hug.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I hurt you.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I started crying again."

I missed out on my chance to win 1,500$

Damn.

Anyways, I was going to go to bed, but decided to write a quick diary entry. I went back and read my diary entries from the 11th and onward. I just can‚Äôt believe how quickly things have resumed with F. Everything is practically normal again. Even normaller than ever. That‚Äôs not even a word ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt give a shit. I just wish he‚Äôd ask me how I‚Äôm doing. How I‚Äôm really doing. Ugh. I need to stop expecting so much from him. He‚Äôs already the best thing to happen to me this year. I‚Äôve learned so much. I‚Äôve grown so much. I feel like I can be an adult now.

Which is only a year and like 20 days away. Woah. Just gave myself a headache trying to imagine me being a legal adult. I‚Äôm a child. I feel like I‚Äôll always be a child. A child who can‚Äôt cope with her emotions. One that‚Äôll never figure life out completely. But I‚Äôm feeling hopeful now. I just watched a video about what sets people out in history. Most of the time it‚Äôs just being in the right place, and not listening to critics. Maybe for me, that means even if that critic is the person whose opinion you value the most.

Maybe I am too obsessed with what F thinks. The photography series I made today really reflects that. I see myself stylistically growing ever closer to his. I can‚Äôt let that happen. I‚Äôve worked so hard at mastering the pen. I will take his advice, but I need to remember that ultimately, for my work to be great, I need to follow my own heart. In life, I need to stay true to myself. I need to choose my own path and stick to it.

Wow, this really turned into a weird rant rather than a log of what happened today. I mean, it was pretty normal. I did wake up early and got to school early to finish the last photograph of my series. I didn‚Äôt really talk to F. I watched the latest GOT episode. Went to some dumb lunch chat in the choir room. The rest was pretty typical. Although after school, I kind of god fed up with H and M and the loud ADD gang. I went into the changing room to work on my drawings. F came in after a bit but just briefly. Eventually they left and I came out to photograph my works. The Latin teacher was talking to him about something or another. I got my stuff all photographed and went to start packing up. We briefly talked about email scammers, and an art show for next year. I hope to god we do something. This would be my last and only chance to display my art how I want. Where I want.

We talked all the way down the hall, he even went out to his car the way I go down the stairs. We talked about it and then suddenly my dad pulled up. I didn‚Äôt even text him. I wish he would wait.

I really feel like I could call F a friend. A teacher / mentor / friend.

Anyways. I hate myself now for not doing that packaging contest. I could have won 1000$ for myself and 500$ for F.

I hope tomorrow will be good."

Today, like every other day, has been a rollercoaster.

But I‚Äôve always liked rollercoasters.

I am sitting in front of the fireplace, facing the window. Outside, it‚Äôs pouring rain. My cat is curled up on the chair in front of me, taking a nap. My mom is making dinner in the kitchen. She‚Äôs making my favourite food, even though it‚Äôs against the rules of our religion. She‚Äôs making it just for me. I didn‚Äôt even ask - I would never have expected anything like this.

I love the sound of the pouring rain outside, and the crackling of the fireplace, and my cat purring softly to himself, and even the distant sounds of my mom cooking frantically, yelling and dropping things and making a scene like she always does.

Yesterday, I put the kids to bed. I helped them brush their teeth and go to the bathroom and put their PJs on. I listened to their secrets and held them while they cried and eased their tiny, worried minds for that moment. I kissed them goodnight and snuggled them in their beds until their breathing slowed to a calm, even pace.

Later tonight, I‚Äôm taking my brother to a movie he was very upset he couldn‚Äôt see earlier. Avengers Endgame. We‚Äôre both looking forward to it.

Spending time with them like this and getting to take care of them while I still can really helps. It makes me feel like I have some control over their well being. And it makes me feel less hopeless about their futures, even once I leave them behind again.

Today, I‚Äôm in as much pain as I always am (physical and emotional). I‚Äôve spent all day alternating between settling conflicts with my family members and hiding away in isolation to deal with my own woes.

But why spoil this moment by focusing on that?

These days, I take my happiness wherever I can get it. I always feel like I‚Äôm stealing it, like I shouldn‚Äôt really have it. But even if I am a thief of joy, in these moments, I truly don‚Äôt care.

Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm home.

...

Update:

Dinner was terrible. My mom had no idea how to make that kind of food. I loved every bite of it. I even let the cat lick the leftovers off my fingers, which I hate doing because then he bugs me for food forever. But he really loves it when I give him a taste.

I didn‚Äôt get to finish my post the way I wanted to because I got interrupted for dinner. But I just wanted to say that to me, this is what progress feels like.

I managed to keep myself mostly together all day. No weed, no drinking, no crying, no despair. I confronted some of the adults about their behaviour towards the kids and I‚Äôm really hopeful that they‚Äôll change. Not a lot, not enough, but a little. For now, I‚Äôll take any change at all. Baby steps.

I‚Äôm coming to accept that this is just the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. I don‚Äôt know if true peace and happiness even exists. If it does, it doesn‚Äôt for me. At least, not yet.

But something about these stolen moments of joy amidst all the chaos and the darkness makes me treasure them all the more. I don‚Äôt take anything for granted, and I‚Äôm grateful for that. In the end, it‚Äôs really the little things that matter the most.

I know I still have a long way to go before I‚Äôm better. But in moments like this, that I wouldn‚Äôt have even been able to have only a few months ago, I‚Äôm able to see that I‚Äôve come a long way too.

Even when it doesn‚Äôt feel like things will ever get better, now I have proof that they already are.

I‚Äôm making progress.

...

Second update:

The cat is eating leftovers off the table because he thinks no one can see him. I know that dumb bastard is gonna make me regret letting him have a taste of people food. But he‚Äôs really having a great time. Fuck it. Let him eat, he‚Äôs the only one who could possibly enjoy the disaster my mom made, anyways. Plus, he‚Äôs just so cute!

...

Third update:

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a journal entry in the present tense. Usually I write them in the past tense, because I like feeling like it‚Äôs over. But right now I‚Äôm actually not trying to escape being alive. Progress!

...

Fourth update:

Today me and mom went to the buffet and

Now I would like to challenge myself and see if I can fast for a day.
It‚Äôs probably going to be hard but then again I usually eat one meal a day(on weekdays)
Tomorrow where going to get groceries so I‚Äôll pick up some healthy and filling foods.
Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to the doctors i plan on telling her my mood has been going down. I‚Äôve been self harming, feeling more agitated and depressed and honestly I want something to chill me the fuck out.

Alright, time for another post. Today was good. I went to work despite mechanical problems. I am getting my car looked at tomorrow so fingers crossed whatever happens isn't too expensive. Ugh. I also didn't relapse today but felt like it and had bad thoughts and felt/ feel frustrated with out lack of sex life and Her showing no interest in me like that and getting upset whenever I touch Her. Ugh. We did play a game together for a bit today and that was fun. Let's focus on the good things. I also finished watching Russian Doll today which I liked a lot. The second to last episode is especially good. I need to lose weight but it's so hard. That's all for now. Whole day off tomorrow! I'm pumped."
0,"30.04.19. Today I decided to tell my mom everything.
I was having a bad day.

Just short of being medically considered comatose, I was lying on the couch in the basement. I‚Äôd been there, unmoving, for hours.

As my mind spun endlessly, I thought: *I give up.*

I could no longer find it in me to care about anything - not even my mom‚Äôs reaction to all the secrets I‚Äôd been keeping from her.

Like sticking a pin in a balloon, I immediately felt myself deflate. All the effort and emotion that comes along with the thoughts I‚Äôd been thinking left me.

I knew the relief was temporary; the hot air of overthinking would blow my balloon back up soon if I didn‚Äôt give them the escape vent they were promised.

I‚Äôd thought about coming clean to my parents before, telling them everything and dealing with the fallout and then having this all be over one way or another.

Could be this be it - the end of all the hiding? Just like that, in a single, random, meaningless moment?

I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I could hear my mom walking around upstairs, but I couldn‚Äôt make myself get off the couch. I knew she wasn‚Äôt busy and would come talk to me if I could just get her attention.

So I called her, even though we were no more than fifteen feet apart.

Our phones rang like two hearts beating out of sync.

In between the rings of my own phone in my ear, I could hear my mom‚Äôs ringtone echoing off the walls and down the stairs.

While I waited, I thought about what I would say when she picked up.

I would ask her to come downstairs.

I would ask her for a hug.

And then I would tell her as much as I could.

After that, I had no idea what would happen.

There was a pit in my stomach and a lump in my throat and the hint of tears stinging against the backs of my eyes. I wiped my sweaty palms on my pants and realized that even my hands had gone numb.

Then, after a lifetime but somehow also all too soon, the ringing stopped. My mom‚Äôs voice filled the sudden silence through the phone. Her casual tone was jarring.

Didn‚Äôt she know I was about to destroy her?

I could barely breathe, let alone hear. How was I supposed to talk to her if I couldn‚Äôt even listen? I tried my best to pay attention. I had to do this now or I knew I never would.

I forced my ears to do their job, and managed to pick up the last few words coming through the phone before it would be my turn to speak. I knew I would remember these words forever.

‚Äú...and I‚Äôll get back to you as soon as possible.‚Äù

It was her voicemail.

I didn‚Äôt bother leaving a message."
0,"4/30/19 Doggy nips
I didn‚Äôt go to school today because I didn‚Äôt get much sleep.
My dog Lola has been sleeping with me more often she even follows me to my room. Tonight I heard her make it weird mouth sound so I go and touch her face since it was pitch black in my room. It turns out she was suckling, I knew she was having a good dream so I gave her some rubs.
Boy oh boy do I wish that dogs didn‚Äôt have nipples I mean I can rub my cats tummy without feeling anything and it‚Äôs great for both of us.
But With the dog some times I just notice her nips and I saddens me that I have to touch them to giver her the tummy rubs that she deserves.:(

Tell me broken boy, warrior, hunter.

Only as a last resort do you call him an angel?

Today I heard news that my best friend K. went to the hospital from what I heard and put together she mixed her meds, walked out of her Bfs house and went to some neighbors house to call her parents[ which were in the city and she was in a town about an hour and a half away]. She had been having mental breakdowns and talked about me a lot( which was nice to hear i that help her and mean more to her than I thought.) she‚Äôs in the ER and I wish I could see her, I couldn‚Äôt last time.
I told her bf try not to feed her drugs because they trigger her. I know it would mean a lot if I came to see her so I‚Äôll ask her bf if he could pick me up on the way there. If not I‚Äôll have to take the buss across city.

Edit 1: tomorrow I‚Äôll call the general hospital to see if she‚Äôs open for visits. If so I‚Äôll skip my second half class and I guess buss it downtown and walk the rest. Maybe I‚Äôll ask mom for some money to get K. a get well present since it‚Äôs the least I can do.

0,"I don‚Äôt like being alive
I don‚Äôt like being alive.

I tell myself that I do. That I‚Äôm too afraid to kill myself. That I know people care about me and would be sad if I died.

But fuck, being alive is hard.

I try my best to do the right thing. I force myself out of bed every day now, even if it takes me a long time. I make sure to socialize at least once every couple days. I stopped self harming. I go to counselling- I reached out for help all by myself. No one else told me to do that. And I pay for it myself too, not with my parents money. I‚Äôm taking time off from school. I submitted that goddamn appeal for all my failed grades even though I really didn‚Äôt want to. I left home, even though it meant trusting the adults to take care of the kids. I only smoke weed at night, and sometimes not at all. I stopped doing all other drugs altogether. I downloaded a CBT app and used it every day. I even journaled for a while. I stopped starving myself, all on my own, and let myself gain all the weight back and then some. Now I‚Äôm a fat piece of shit, but who cares? As long as I get better. Stopped counting calories. Stopped making excuses. Forced myself to leave the house. Forced myself to leave the house at night. Forced myself to go outside by myself. Forced myself to go back to campus. Forced myself to go to parties. Even forced myself to go on dates for a while, until one of them pulled a fucking knife on me. No one cares. No one even noticed. I did all this work just get back to functioning at the absolute bare minimum like any basic fucking person.

It‚Äôs all SO fucking hard. How do other people do this? I struggled so much and they all just do it, like it‚Äôs nothing. Not that any of the shit I did even mattered in the end. I‚Äôm still completely miserable. Why does nothing help?

I‚Äôm trying. I really am. It‚Äôs all I can do at this point. Even though all this shit is so fucking hard. Some days all I wanna do is get high and lie in bed and ignore everyone and everything. Sometimes it takes literally everything in me not to cut. Sometimes all I can do is curl up and cry. Or just lie there like a corpse - wishful thinking, I guess. Sometimes while I‚Äôm lying there I like to tell myself that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok in the end if I just keep trying.

But I don‚Äôt know if it will. I did everything as right as I know how and shit still fucking sucks.

They say being raped isn‚Äôt your fault. That you can do everything right and still get raped because it‚Äôs rape, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I didn‚Äôt do everything right that night. Far from it. But hearing that still makes me feel hopeless. I can do everything right and it won‚Äôt even matter. I‚Äôll just find out I might have a fucking autoimmune disorder instead, right as I‚Äôm starting to pull myself out of this deep dark depression hole. Or I‚Äôll just find out that things have gotten worse at home. They were getting better, for a while. Or maybe I‚Äôll just have a repressed memory come back of the time I was fucking molested as a kid.

Or who knows? Maybe my shitty, broken brain will act up and I‚Äôll just decide that my entire life is pretend and everything bad that ever happened is a lie I made up to get out of my responsibilities because I‚Äôm such a fucking failure I needed to fake getting gang raped to get out of going to school while demanding sympathy for being so fucking pathetic that I can‚Äôt even do basic fucking functions to take care of myself.

I don‚Äôt even have a job. I was gonna get one, but then I didn‚Äôt. Story of my fucking life. It‚Äôs honestly amazing there‚Äôs still people around who put up with me. It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm lying to them. I‚Äôm lying to everyone. I don‚Äôt even know what the truth is anymore.

Goddammit, I‚Äôm spiralling again.

The stupid fucking CBT app told me to do a breathing exercise if I feel like this. I don‚Äôt even want to breathe!

What a fucking waste of oxygen.

I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself. That would be too selfish. But I fucking HATE being alive and I wish I would just get hit by a fucking bus already. Not that I would be lucky enough to actually die if I got hit by a bus. I‚Äôd probably just lose a leg or get internal bleeding or some shit. How the fuck has none of this shit killed me yet? I don‚Äôt even want to be alive, what a fucking waste of oxygen!

I‚Äôm drinking alone in my locked bathroom right now. I just looked at the time- it‚Äôs exactly midnight. A brand new day. Fucking fantastic.

I hate being a ‚Äútrooper‚Äù. I hate my chronic leg pain and my goddamn maybe-celiac disease and my TWO fucking rapes (or possibly more like 5 or 6. Depends if you count each individual guy as one rape, or if you just group them all into one event. Not that I even know how many guys were there that night. I was fucking blackout shitfaced. Not that it even matters past a certain point how many people rape you. It all blurs together.) and I hate being the oldest of fucking EIGHT younger siblings and cousins I have to be fucking responsible for all the time no matter what of my own shit I have going on and that‚Äôs not even mentioning my shitty, stupid parents and aunts and uncles and older cousins that I also have to support for whatever fucking reason and my fucking learning disability and all my goddamn anxiety and motherfucking PTSD (if I even have that which I didn‚Äôt want to know if I did until my counsellor fucking told me I did when I didn‚Äôt even ask because I didn‚Äôt want to fucking know) and all the other awful thoughts and fucked up twisted mental health problems I probably have and most of all I HATE myself and I hate my stupid fucking life and I wish it would just fucking END already.

What the fuck did I do to deserve this? Is it because I made everything up? Now dealing with the consequences is my punishment.

I don‚Äôt believe in hell. I don‚Äôt need to. This is worse.

I hope I drink myself to death in this bathroom.

With my luck, though? I fucking doubt it. I‚Äôm just so fucking lucky."

I haven‚Äôt written in a while. Things have just been normal. I guess.

I‚Äôve been struggling lately. My self harm is back and as bad as ever. I can‚Äôt stop. I just want to cut all the time. My legs look so bad.

I miss her so bad. I haven‚Äôt told anyone ever.

I pray for the opportunity to talk about it. I just want F to ask me if I‚Äôm doing okay, and I just want to confess how much I miss mom. I don‚Äôt care if he cares. I just feel like he‚Äôs the only one who would care.

I‚Äôve been having a tough weekend. Friday was so awkward. I stayed in the changing room after school doing nothing because I didn‚Äôt wanna interrupt MYM club. Eventually towards the end of their meeting F came in the room and asked what I was doing. I just said I was gonna make a cyanotype but then didn‚Äôt feel like it and didn‚Äôt want to interrupt their meeting. It seemed so awkward. I got up to leave but he said I could wait. I just sat in silence, ashamed. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I‚Äôm ashamed of who I am, how I am.

Eventually I left and I got outside and just started crying. I miss mom so much. So bad.

I cried more Friday night. I cried at work Saturday. I cried and cried and cried Saturday night. I caved in and emailed Grammy about the birds. SIREN IS A MOTHER
SHES LAID 15+ EGGS.

Oh god. I cried during church. Apparently Louie is at some guys place who works for uncle K. He has a whole backyard and everything. I hope he‚Äôs happy.

I miss mom so much. So so so so so so much. Everything reminds me of her. And now I‚Äôm crying again.

I want her back. It‚Äôs not fair. I feel so alone. I wish she was buried, not cremated. I wish I could have a grave to visit and cry over. Now I have to wait for my grandparents to die so I can inherit her ashes and phone etc. It‚Äôs awful to say, but I almost hope they die soon. I want moms memory for myself. She‚Äôs not theirs, never was. I just wanna hold her once more.

I want someone to know how much pain I‚Äôm in. Dad would NEVER understand. No one understands. Maybe F might.

I wish I had the guts to kill myself. But I never will.

I just want mom back. AND HOW DOES ALYSSA EXPECT ME TO RUN BACK TO GOD WHEN THAT MEANS ACCEPTING THAT MY MOTHER IS BURNING IN HELL FOR ETERNITY???

I hate myself. I want to die. But I wish I could die right. I saw endgame tonight. I cried a lot.

I hate myself"

I didn‚Äôt write yesterday. Because not much happened. It was a normal Tuesday. Tuesday‚Äôs suck. F wasn‚Äôt there to make it interesting. It‚Äôs like my fam was gone.

But J has been worrying me lately. She‚Äôs made a few very dry suicide jokes and I‚Äôm actually concerned for her. Z‚Äôs death really seems to be getting to her. Even though they weren‚Äôt close, she‚Äôs really feeling the loss. So I texted her last night. I told her I know how lonely death can feel, but that she‚Äôs not alone, blah blah, and that I‚Äôm always here to talk if she needs it. I really do genuinely care for her. She and L have helped me confidence and self-love so much. I don‚Äôt want them to feel down.

I kind of hope she doesn‚Äôt come into the cafeteria this morning to talk. I feel so awkward getting emotional in public, and I really never know the words to say. Whatever. I really hope today is a good day. I‚Äôm getting my hair dyed after art club! Woo hoo. I am so ashamed of my hair. It looks so gross. My roots are like an inch or longer and the color looks like a rusty dirt. Not in a good way!

I hope my clothes arrive soon too. I‚Äôm excited for a fresh appearance. If only I could lose weight haha.

I don‚Äôt know what to wear. My laundry should have been done like three weeks ago. I might just wear my baseball t. It‚Äôs the only one that‚Äôs large and comfy. Maybe I‚Äôll risk shorts again? Who knows. I should get ready now. And find my debit card! Yikes."

Alright, we are so close now. Had a few rough days in a row though. I relapsed today and twice yesterday. But we are living through this week all the same. My diet has been really bad too. However, I know that I got at least two guaranteed A's this semester, another one should be on its way once its grade is posted, and I think my presentation will be good enough to push me over the hump for another A (although that one is a little trickier because there is a number of moving parts with it). I sure do feel pretty lucky tbh. My two known A's I got by the skin of my teeth. I just need to do well on the presentation tomorrow and get at least an 80% on my final on Thursday (still got a lot of studying to do for that though, its no guarantee I'll get that 80). Pretty sure if I get all of them I'll be the only person in my small group that has a 4.0 still. WOOOOO! Can't get too hyped yet though. Still have work to be done.

Anyways in the last 15min I told her if she really believed that I stole her weed I also told her not to go behind my make and make accusations because it‚Äôs rude. She said she would keep that in mind and stayed quiet.
I told her how it made me feel anxious and more self aware of our shitty household, so I stopped.
It‚Äôs normally very hard for me to confront people but i knew I‚Äôd have to step up to her and maybe one day I‚Äôll become more confident in myself.

Also my meds have been doing well for me and I hope to find new friends!

Unfortunately I‚Äôm still self harming and I think my moms catching on she keeps looking at my ankle[above region] which is where it primarily happens. I hand washed my socks and I can‚Äôt believe how much blood got soaked up, I couldn‚Äôt tell because it was black.

Peoples extreme self harm looks so bad that it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been burnt, all of the scars have distorted the skin making it unlevel and discoloured. Honestly it‚Äôs disgusting and horrible."

I‚Äôve been so lost. So corrupt. So wicked, evil, impure. I obsess over a sinner, and disregard God like He‚Äôs nothing.

All I‚Äôve done for the majority of the school year is obsess about F. Every action, decision, thing I make/say, is all for him ‚Äî or to be like him. Sure.. he‚Äôs great. But he‚Äôs not been great for me. He‚Äôs an idol. Art has become my idol. My obsession. I have no time/interest for God when the focus of my life is art. I‚Äôm so weak, and lose my faith so easily. I feel so guilty before Him. What have I done? You foolish, foolish sinner, you.

I talked with Alyssa today. She knows me too well. I can‚Äôt hide my unbelief from her. She knows. The way I go on and on about art... she knows how much of an idol it is to me. How could I be so foolish? I prayed this afternoon. I truly prayed for the first time in almost a year. I asked God to give me my desire back. I repented for being so disobedient. I asked him to take away my obsession with F, and turn it towards Him.

At the end of the day, F is only a teacher/mentor. But God.. the creator. The one who, by his mercy, saved me. Saved me from damnation, from eternal fire, to live with him forevermore for all of eternity when I die, or when he returns. The one who‚Äôs always looked out for me. The one who‚Äôs been so gracious when I ran from him. The one who holds out his open arms while I ran to a sinners. I thought I could save myself. I thought I could figure everything out by myself. Even if that were true, what of death? Oh what a miserable life without Christ. I need no longer worry when I put my trust in Him. He‚Äôs always been there for me.

I want my heart to change. Lord change me. With each passing second my mind wanders back to the fleeting things of this world. Keep me heaven bound.

My baptism was not worthless. I just fell away.

But. Today was ok.

Nothing exciting happened. I gave F his deckled edge ripper. He loved it. My prints made with the ferric chloride didn‚Äôt really work. The lines were very blurry. F asked Rub about it. Apparently that‚Äôs normal for a soft ground. I‚Äôve kinda lost hope. I‚Äôm so lost right now. I really need some direction."

So im am just going to type my thoughts and daily routines down here. It's the only place that i think is safe
I don't trust Facebook, whisper, twitter or google no more
And it not like i could write anything down my aunt would just find it and i don't need that.
I will not say my real name unless i see it is fit to tell it but only to those i truly trust if that may happen which i doubt it but i will let you know a few little details about me
I take care of an old man that is not blood-related to me
His wife goes to work a few days out of the week at night anf doesn't return till early morning. I have  the house to myself
I do not let people come over or go out once she leaves
All windows and doors are sealed right.
I keep a schedule during the day when the wife is home i tend to stay to myself not talking much to her an hour or 2 is the most i see here after work than she is off to bed,
The old man isn't much to deal with.  Unless he wishes to go outside

I don't see too many people around here, i don't go outside unless i have to and i avoid. Going into town
This is all i can type for now a part  2 might be coming later on

In Middle School, I used to cry myself to sleep, When I brought it up to family they'd tell you ""Stop being so dramatic"", so you bring it up to you're friends but then again it's a competition of whose life sucks the most. Invalidating. So you sit silently hurting. Silently crying, so no one else knows or even comments. Now I don't cry-I feel as I've finally ""sucked it up"". I'm finally 'normal' so used to the emotionless, dry, anxiety I set in a bed of darkness with an emotionless facial expression. I never thought I'd be so comfortable.

&#x200B;

Then you come with your jackhammer, Chiseling every wall I've ever built the ""Wall of Shame"". My Berlin madness captivating my emotions from defecting west.

Let me take you back to High School. My five best friends and I shared one notebook. The rules were:

&#x200B;

1. We had to be honest about EVERYTHING

2. We need to write real emotions

3. Nothing leaves the notebook and it's a judgment-free zone( Until now)

4. When we saw each other we had to pass the notebook off with a new entry

&#x200B;

By doing this we became closer more respectful and connected in unbelievable ways. You can write about ANYTHING, EVERYTHING, and DRAW. Nothing is off limits and you're going to hear our story here ( rule #3). I've already let them know, and we are ready to open you up to our lives to you.

Today was a bad day overall. Mainly because I only studied for a very little bit but have big projects and exams coming this week that I am not ready for. My plan is to wake up early tomorrow and start working my butt off to try and get prepared for the week. It will just be a few intense days of working and then I can chill for a bit come Thursday night and into Sunday. I had some anxiety today. Mostly over feeling frustrated about our complete lack of sex life and Her lack of interest in me in that way. I know it's difficult for Her with what I've done in the past but I still feel like She should be interested sometimes. Idk. It's been making me feel really negative about our relationship lately and I am not sure what to do about it. We ate Easter dinner with my family which was pretty good. Alright, that's all for now I would say. Time to hit the hay and get to work early."

My cuts are this beautiful bruised purple color. I wish I could post a pic. There‚Äôs some horrific beauty to them unlike any I‚Äôve seen before. I want to cut the scab off and watch them bleed again. Ugh, that‚Äôs so disturbing.

Work was GREAT. I forget how much I love my job and the people there. I wouldn‚Äôt trade it at all right now. I feel bad about dissing work. They‚Äôre like a second family sometimes.

Today was fun. I planted some plants. Now I‚Äôm gonna shower and do some laundry. I hope to draw tomorrow. That is my biggest goal.

Woke up nice and rested. I checked my phone. F Facebook invited me to a T-shirt printing thing at Odd. It looks interesting. But I was just so thrilled he thought I‚Äôd be interested. I was screaming in the inside. I doubt I‚Äôll go. But it seems cool.

I went to ace and bought some seeds and dirt. I‚Äôm determined to get it right. I told Auggie on my story that I‚Äôd figure it out. While I was down at the mart, I had McD‚Äôs and met Zoe at Starbucks. I told her how excited I was for her to be in high school. Gosh, I‚Äôm just excited about everything. About art, about summer, about camp, about Zoe. Things are gonna be great. Life is great. Jeez, I‚Äôm so bipolar.

Yet I got home. Took out my blade and cut my leg pretty deep. They bled down my leg. And dripped onto my nice sock. They‚Äôre all purple now. These are gonna leave nasty scars. I don‚Äôt know why I do it. It doesn‚Äôt really hurt to do. It‚Äôs not a pain thing for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just broken. My brain isn‚Äôt wired right or something. I wish I‚Äôd find something better to do that cut myself next time.

Work was ok. Church was okay. It was Good Friday. When we got home we all talked about dreams, and eventually talked about memories from when we were kids. God. I miss being a kid. I really do. But I‚Äôve also realized I haven‚Äôt changed a bit. I‚Äôm still goofy af. And my sister is still a little diva. But I love it.

The only thing missing is mom.

I‚Äôm too tired to cry. I‚Äôm gonna sleep now. It‚Äôs midnight. Tomorrow I need to plant my plants, and take a pic of my camera shirt."
0,"Crazyness inside my head
This all happened within a 24hour period
This is my clusterfucked mind, I know it's all.over the place, but I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on in my brain.

We were having a regular night in Cuba, saxophoniste playing for people in the lobby, everyone seemed into it but barely any dancing, other than the synchronized dancers. I met a Anne-Marie and her aunt, Sylvie, Anne-Marie had a come hither look that made me feel alive, however being the shy person that I am, and figuring she was way out of my league, I decided to smile and let her flirt. I flirted back a bit, she was drunk and she was there to party. She tries to get me to dance a few times but I was unwilling as my alcohol intake hadn't reached the ""I don't give a fuck"" level. And in all honesty, the place was cracking with people. Anne-Marie kept dancing and drinking, her aunt seemed worried. She kept saying let's live life like it's our last night on earth, to which I finally understood, through an acquaintance she met and introduced me to, and through her own verbiage through out the night, she wanted to die. Now I've been through this with an ex that I loved dearly, and it's not something I take lightly, I tried to talk with her, but she wanted to keep partying and drinking, inviting pretty much everyone around her to dance, which to my surprise, did not work out in her favor. I keep telling myself, if I was in better shape and not as shy, I probably would have been all over that like fat kid (me) on cake. But the emotional distress she was in was worrysome. I was able to talk to her before leaving, mentioning that I'd like to carry on our conversation during the day tomorrow, hoping that I will catch her in a sober moment. I mentioned to her not to be shy, I'm not judging you and I really want to have a chat with you tomorrow. I really hope she does come over and say hi, she legitimately seems like an awesome person going through a bad time. I may not be the one that pulls her out of the water, but I'm hoping I can be a help to her somewhere along her journey, however hard it may be. After having one last drink on the second lobby and hoping to see her pass by, I went to bed hoping that someone doesn't take advantage of her, and that her aunt will be there for her if something we're to happen. Maybe I should have stuck around longer? To what end?, I can only help, and she won't necessarily listen to a guy she just met, or would she ?

I went to bed worried, hoping that the best in people would shine for another night.


Part 2, morning of April 19th (p1/p?)

I didn't think I had seen Anne Marie and her aunt during our stay even though they arrive before us, however crossing them at the restaurant reminded me that we had crossed paths. My mother greeted them and I waved hello, but I was mostly ignored, or so I felt. I had mixed feelings about this feeling of being ignored, I had really tried to help her the night before, as much as I could at least, I don't know if she's embarrassed or if she doesn't remember, maybe we will cross paths again tonight and we will know for sure, if she's not as wasted as last night that is...

P2/P?
Further during our morning of reading on the beach whilst listening to the waves crashing on the beach, I found myself thinking that this was the first time in a long time that someone had flirted with me and reciprocating. I am sometimes oblivious to women flirting but I'm pretty sure this is the first time in a long time. It made me feel good, even though I could tell it was just drunken flirting that in a normal setting, she likely would not have looked at me twice, I know it sounds like I'm being hard on myself, but history hasn't proved me wrong. I'm feeling a bit touchy feely this morning, I guess this started when I got to the resort and seeing multiple couples look like they are having the grandest of times and that love is flowing everywhere  I'm starting slowly to be jealous about this, it's been a good 4 years since my ex came home and told me she didn't love me anymore, thinking about it still is like a stab through my heart as it was the hardest thing I've ever been through to this day. What happened last night reminded me of how it was nice to be with someome even though I wear this big armor right now and claim that I'm better off alone. The jealousy is probably what got me to uninstall Facebook, everyone's life is so beautiful and fake, probably like some of the couple's here who are just enjoying there time.because it's vacation?  I don't know, all I know is I feel like crap today, and maybe I should have seen a therapist a few years ago, that I always put off because I'm ""OK"". I'm full of shit is what that is...


Whilst taking my shower I was thinking and wanted to add a small part to my last entry, this girl might be the one that turns this all around for me, she made me realise that I miss taking care of someone else other than myself. I've always wanted kids and was not sure where to go with this after my ex left, I see so many kids that only see there dad 4 days a month, my feelings inside me when I think about if I was in that situation, break my heart. I have more quality time with my friends kid then her own father has, for some time I figured that would be sufficient for me, take care of other people's kids. I think this whole ordeal has lit a fire back in me I thought was gone... Maybe I'm blowing everything out of proportion...maybe not..."

Oh my god it‚Äôs already the 18th. Jeez. Only a month left of school. Ughhhh. I‚Äôve got so much to do. Not enough time. Time to kick it into gear.

Today was great. Wholesome even. Started out with a stupid math quiz. Then the lamest pep assembly in the world. I sat with Alex. Mrs. SB got teacher of the year. She totally deserves it.

I came in to F‚Äôs room during lunch to work on painting my screen with the screen filler. He took his drawing class outside or something to draw. I was alone for a while. River texted me asking where I was so I told her to come to F‚Äôs room. We talked and stuff. Then I got the sudden urge to write an inspirational quote on the board. So I did. She drew a little dragon. Then all of a sudden the bell rang. I looked at my phone. It was 11:45. That was the bell to be back in class. Shittttt I thought. Then I told River I‚Äôd make up a pass for myself. I looked around for a piece of paper, then I found F‚Äôs pad of passes on his desk and took one. I didn‚Äôt know his signature off the top of my head obviously. Then I had the bright idea to use an old seminar pass. I spent a minute or two looking around the class and in the trash for one, then I remembered there‚Äôs one probably stuffed in my bag. Eventually I found it and I forged his signature. River was kind of surprised, but not shocked. I‚Äôm a goody two shoes, I‚Äôll admit. But I‚Äôm like lawful neutral. I don‚Äôt want to be late to class, so I‚Äôll steal a pass and forge a signature. Haha whatever. Anyways, I made it to class and Mrs. SB accepted my pass. All was well. We watched like most of the Great Gatsby. The new one. WHICH WE DID LIKE A MONTH AGO IN HISTORY. Ughhh. Whatever, at least it‚Äôs entertainment.

So then came 6th hour. My critique was first. It was weird. Everyone else just started talking without F even really being there. Looking at my work as a whole, I was embarrassed. It really didn‚Äôt look that good. My cyanotypes were bad. Everything sucked. F didn‚Äôt really take part because he was busy with something on his computer. I don‚Äôt have the faintest idea what I‚Äôll do for my next project. Then we moved on to other people‚Äôs stuff. I had a lot better things to say today for sure. I made a smart comment on Liza‚Äôs photos that I think impressed F. At least I hope so. After that I just sat around and watched Lily work on the computer with illustrator.

Then the bell rang, and I asked F if I could print some t-shirts. He said he didn‚Äôt have any but I said I went to Savers last night and picked up a few. I printed my shirts. The first one turned out awful. So did the second, but by the third, I thought we had a good strategy down. He commented on how communal screen printing is as an activity. The ink started to dry in the holes where the ink came out earlier, which made for a better print.

Eventually everyone left. I got all my shirts printed, cleaned my screen, got my stuff packed. And was ready to leave, when he mentioned he was staying later today because he didn‚Äôt have to pick up his son. I talked with Alex and F about kids and how rebellious they are at the middle school age. We also talked about my art camp stuff. He asked if I got it all figured out. I told him how excited I was. He said he hopes R is my instructor when I‚Äôm there this summer. He didn‚Äôt realize that I got to stay on campus and stuff when I was there. I‚Äôm really excited to use a professional studio with proper equipment when I‚Äôm there. Maybe it‚Äôll be a chance for me to print some copper plates I‚Äôll etch during June. Or not. Who knows!

Oh gosh, I can‚Äôt even remember what we talked about. But things were good. He asked if I had any t-shirts his size, and I said yeah, I made for this one for him. He said he loved it. I hope it fits him. He wanted the XL and not the larger one. But it‚Äôs okay, I like oversized t-shirts anyways. Plus I tried it on at home and it looked cute on me. I also tried etching my test plate from the other week for another 15 minutes or so. I washed it off and it worked! It really worked! Next I‚Äôll make a test strip so I can figure out how long I need to etch for the best printing results. F said I should get a large plate at the store and draw onto that. I told him that was my goal. I‚Äôm so excited for the whole world of possibilities this opens up.

I think things are normal again. Exactly a week now, and it‚Äôs like it never happened. And I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm having a great day today.

It was like 4:30 before I left. Dad had to wait in the car for me because I forgot to text him and tell him I was staying late. On the way out we briefly talked about work and my job and raises and stuff. He said I should ask for a raise if I was told I‚Äôd get one and if I am doing a higher level job now. I agree with him. I just don‚Äôt want the trouble. I already hate initiating conversations, and one about a raise for me would be so awkward.

When I got home I posted a pic of me in my new cool shirt on my story, mentioning that I‚Äôd sell some. F replied later and said that it was a great idea. He said he loved his shirt, and that the mushroom one I made the other day would sell really well too. I told him I didn‚Äôt really love the mushroom one. That I‚Äôd make new, better ones soon. I thanked him for helping me so much with this screen printing stuff.

I ate some hot pockets for dinner. Then later I went on a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and went to price chopper. I grabbed some hair ties and stuff, and some reces pieces and granola bars and a grape zevia. I watched Glass, and the Green Book tonight. Both were good. Glass didn‚Äôt really feel like a sequel to split. I didn‚Äôt think Split needed a sequel if I‚Äôll be honest. Anyways, I‚Äôm having a great day. And I‚Äôm totally exhausted and going to go to sleep.

Hopefully tomorrow I‚Äôll be in an art making mood. I need to get shit done!"

I been having a headache for the last two days. I have not taken any medicine for it. i believe it has something to do with me not taking my antidepressants. it been two weeks since i stopped and so far the hell has just begun. my doctor wants me to make an appointment but i don't have time since my boss is retarded and wants to work me 6 days a week. hopefully the withdrawal ends and i can feel better.

I have a new co-worker with the same name as my dad and we seemed to hit it off well. when i first laid eyes on him, i was drooling. he is tal, thick and masculine with a nice ass. sad part is that he is not gay but i been fantasizing about him being mine. i already added him on Snapchat and Facebook. once i get his phone number, maybe we can text more. he is extroverted and a talker but i feel like me and him cant relate since we are polor opposites.

I been working back to back and yesterday was my only off day. im liking im getting so many hours but i value my off day. maybe i shouldn't complain because i can easily go back to getting 12 hours a week. I just hate my job and need time to breathe.

i keep spending money from my savings to my off my credit card. im not being responsible with my spending. im going backwards and i hate it. my impulsive ways is fucking me up.

It‚Äôs like nothing ever happened. And I don‚Äôt know if I like it. But I‚Äôm sure a lot happier. That‚Äôs a good thing. Maybe I can escape from this without dad finding out after all.

The weirdest thing happened this morning, Gabe came and sat down with me in the cafeteria. We just chatted about school. I was kinda nervous and trying to sound cool. I kinda like Gabe.. always have. He‚Äôs always been cute. Even before he lost weight. We have a lot of common ground too. I wish we were better friends. I should DM him a meme again soon. Note to self.

But yeah, today was pretty easy. Just watched Brooklyn 99 through 5th hour. In 3rd hr, Mrs. H said I had to go take some state assessment for science. Lilah ended up being in the same room as me. We talked for a bit. We both decided that we were going to quit FL this year. I‚Äôm glad we both agree on that.

Lunch was alright. Raegan has started noticing my earrings like every single day. I feel proud of that ngl.

7th hr was a drag. I was in too much of a good mood to play anxious. I was actually feeling great. I felt more comfortable talking around/to F. After critiques, and when class was over, I asked for some help with paying my camp deposit. There was a glitch with the website. He suggested I just email them. I did. I still can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôm literally so excited. This is going to be one of the most fun things ever.

So after that I asked if I could mess with the screen drawing fluid and stuff. He handed me a bottle of some dark red liquid. I sat down with my screen and a paintbrush and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. F jokes around and said I should put ‚Äú(ME) RULES‚Äù and then I can run around screen printing it on people and walls and stuff. Obviously that‚Äôs not how it works but it was funny af. But then I said really, what should I do? He said I should paint the camera sitting on the table. I said sure, and I warned him I sucked at painting.

The table behind me was having some interesting conversations. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh and look at F. I‚Äôm really glad he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying. I feel really special and appreciated. I can‚Äôt wait for my deckled edge ripper gift to arrive. He‚Äôs gonna love it! Anyways, I finished my camera drawing and it looked pretty good for being drawn directly on the screen from a paintbrush and no drawing. Then when he was watching a video on how to do this process, he realized I was using the wrong material to paint on the screen. I was using the screen filler not the drawing fluid. Ughhh. So I just made an outline around it and started filling in the rest of the screen with a broader brush. I figured I‚Äôd just print with white ink on a dark shirt. I only got around halfway done filling in the screen when F had to leave. I cleaned up my brushes and asked if I could come in early tomorrow. He said sure, but then I realized that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to because of teacher meetings. Then he said I could do seminar, but I remembered we had a pep assembly. That started a mini conversation on pep assembly‚Äôs. Then I just said I‚Äôd come in during lunch. He told me I was welcome anytime any hour. And I left.

He didn‚Äôt once bring up my email or anything. I think he just forgot, but I was totally okay with not talking about it. I wish he‚Äôd just say one last thing. Just so I know what he‚Äôs thinking. But things are going so well I don‚Äôt want to ruin it.

He waved to me when he passed me on the stairs outside. Everything is going back to normal. Finally. Exactly a week and everything‚Äôs pretty much okay. So we went to Savers after dropping my stuff off at home. I got a few black shirts, and one for F. The guy who cashed me out was really nice and said I‚Äôd make a great employee there. He was actually super nice and I wrote a good review of him on the survey thing on my receipt.

Went to church. Shopped around on H&M. I really wanna order some clothes. They just scream me. I‚Äôm so pumped. It started raining a lot at home. Some big thunderstorms went through. Picked up my room a bit. Cut my bangs. Took a shower. Braided my hair so it will be wavy tomorrow. Then I went outside to the garage and sat in the back of the trunk and watched the storm while snacking on some leftover strawberry frosting. It‚Äôs still raining now. The thunder and lighting are crazy. I opened my window a bit so I could hear the rain. Hopefully the cars won‚Äôt be too loud when I sleep. Also I am trying to take advantage of my Spotify premium and listen to as much music as possible.

I think tomorrow will be normal. I have an excuse to stay after now... HELL YEAH. T-shirt printing! But I am not looking forward to critiques.

I can‚Äôt believe things are going back to normal. Thank god."

Today was a decent day I suppose. I didn't relapse, had some anxiety a bit which happens. I had an exam that I think went pretty well.

I don't have to work tomorrow which is awesome. That means I only work Saturday this weekend which will give me a lot of time to prepare for final exams. Alright, that's all for now.

0,"Whoops! I did it again
 Houston, we have a problem. A BIG one. So big that if it's not addressed, I see myself filing for E.I. yet again, if I don't go Batshit first.
I've always had difficulty dealing with Obsessive Compulsive personalities. I don't know why, but their apparent high stress/energy just rubs me the wrong way & raises my anxiety, which then gets me angry.
It happened at \*BIFF!\*,  & now it's happening again here.
There has always been tension between me & this customer, right from the get-go. From the very moment I even saw his face I felt anxious. I hated him almost instantly.
Thankfully, I don't have to deal with him every day, but when I do, it always raises my anxiety.
So, yesterday I see he posts a question to which I thought I might have an answer.
I should have known better than to even respond, just by his 4-page question alone.
But, I bite & would live to regret it.
Sure enough, he responds. Naturally, I didn't solve his query, so he further delves into his bizarre little tirade.
I decide to break off at this point, but too late.
I've already granted him an audience & that was all he needed.
I didn't respond in 30 seconds to his response, so he calls me, knowing our cell is complete shit. As soon as I hear his voice, I recognize him from our previous encounters & I can feel my blood pressure rising. He continues on in a demanding & (what I thought to be anyway) very condescending tone. Now, I HAVE to withdraw as I can feel my Anxiety rising. Fuck, I don't need this shit!
I try to end the call, but of course, he calls right back. INSTANTLY I block his number. Now the game is on. I thought I had won, but no.
Sure enough, he comes downstairs & as soon as I see his ugly fucking \*BIFF!\* face I wanna KILL this guy. The breaking point was where he tells me, not asks, TELLS me I need to do...
Lose it.
I try with my last bit of self-control to tell him politely he can do this task himself. I REALLY wanted to tell him to fuck the hell off & get off my ass & get a fucking life. But I refrained from doing so, but my feelings could not be stopped. I punched a small hole in the wall, to which he immediately looked stunned. It was too late. He had crossed the line. And as he walked away I SHOUTED: I FUCKING HATE \*BIFF!\*
INSTANTLY I felt weak. You know that feeling right after a fight when you start coming down from the Endorphin rush? ThAT'S pretty much how I felt.
For the 3rd time in less than 4 months, I had lost it again. And not only lost it, but to the extreme. One thing about me, I never do anything half measure.
But the damage was done. I had fucked up & fucked up ROYALLY yet again. I had to get out of there. Just get away. NOW.
I limped away & hid in a nearby hallway where I could be secluded. I didn't want to see ANYBODY. I was in full licking my wounds mode.
I called my Wife. Of course, she was away from her phone, so I had no help there.
I called 21 times to at least leave her the impression that I needed to speak to her immediately.
I felt sick to my stomach. THIS time, I REALLY did it. I turned off my Work Phone as I just couldn't deal with anybody right now. Thankfully, it was close enough to lunch so I skulked upstairs to the Lunchroom where I fully absorbed the enormity of what I had just done. I needed help. As much as I didn't want to deal with people right now, I wanted to talk to my wife. Failing that, I even tried the (what I THOUGHT was)Crisis line & of course, got some school my mistake.
Finally, my wife becomes available & I unload my latest burden on her because with everything else going on for her, she really needs to deal with my shit too.
I HATE that I can't be the strong one. that I'm weak & need to dump my problems on someone. I hate the sense of loss of control. I hate having to need someone. To need ANYBODY.
But I DID need my wife now & I burdened her.
We both agreed I should take an extended lunch at LEAST, to which I did.
Althewhile dreading what would be awaiting me once I returned. The Asshole? With my Manager perhaps? My Boss? All this anxiety I caused simply because I can't get along with someone. FUCK, but I HATE who I am sometimes. A pathetic, WEAK little pussy who is scared of everything & everybody. It's a miracle I can even hold a job for even more than 2 weeks.
I remember way back when I was a Teenager & I had a meeting with a Shrink. Even back then he predicted I would never be able to hold a job. That I would forever wander from job to job & fuck if he wasn't right! HOW did this person write my entire life's script way back when I was only 15 years old? how the HELL did he know what would happen? How I would turn out?
I just don't understand...
But back to today. It was 5 past 2 pm. I couldn't put it off any longer. I collected myself as best I¬†could & still with my phone off, I headed back downstairs. Nobody. Nobody was there. thank GOD.                                                                            Of course, there was a shitload of \*BIFF!\*, but this was a GOOD thing in this instance as it could provide a legitimate reason for me to dismiss \*BIFF!\* if he came calling again.
I happily lent myself to the distraction of my task & before I knew it, it was 4pm.
Hell, \*BIFF!\* even managed to show up on time!
Maybe. Just maybe I might be able to get out of here today without any further grief.
I managed to do just that & even when I got home, not a single call, email or text.
Now today, 24 hrs. later, not a thing has been mentioned. Not to me, at least.
I may indeed have dodged a bullet at work, yet AGAIN, but the underlying problem remains.                                                    I have issues that need to be addressed & they need addressing NOW if I am to ever hold a job."

Alright, had a bit of a big day. Got an assignment back and I didn't like the grade that I got on it. There is one thing that literally nobody in the class did that was expected of us so we all got points off. I feel that if literally no one included it then it wasn't made clear enough/taught to us that is was necessary to include. I think it's a bunch of bull. I also relapsed today which sucks. I have had a pretty good day academically though. I am worried about tomorrow. I have a bit exam that I need to do really well on to get an A and it's freaking me out. I think I need close to 100% to get an A and that just doesn't seem all that doable. Well, I studied a bit yesterday, a lot today, and will study more tomorrow. All I can do is hope for the best. After that I have two more papers to write this week and then I get to start studying and creating my final projects. Woohoo. Ugh. Tomorrow will be one week away from the last day of exams. Whew. What a dumb semester it's been. Hoping to keep the 4.0 in tact but I'm not holding my breath."

Well, so much build up for nothing. Everything works out in the end. It always does. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm not able to see that when I‚Äôm going through crap.

I felt really nervous sitting in the cafeteria this morning. F did not reply to my email last night, although there was not much to reply to. I felt nervous that he was only just reading it this morning. I started watching Brooklyn 99. It‚Äôs pretty funny. I‚Äôm glad Spotify comes with Hulu now, even though Hulu has ads.

Then during fourth hour. I convinced myself I probably wasn‚Äôt going to talk to the social worker. She hasn‚Äôt sent me a pass, and I just haven‚Äôt heard anything. But my pride got ahead of me and I got a pass during English. My heart stopped for a second. I tried to play it cool without freaking out. I mean, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen immediately? I started to realize my previous thoughts were kind of wrong. I got super anxious and antsy. I‚Äôve been on edgy all week and just can‚Äôt stop picking at my skin or bouncing my leg.

I didn‚Äôt talk to the social worker much. I didn‚Äôt really want to talk to her. I think she realized that. She said she just wanted to let me know that she was here, and there are resources available if I need them. She said Mr. F probably knows what‚Äôs going on better than she does. She asked if things were going okay with school. She asked what I usually did when I got stressed out with school. She basically gave me the answers. I knew where she was trying to go with that question. I wouldn‚Äôt let her in. I wasn‚Äôt in there but 10 mins. She gave me her card. It was so awkward, and I was relieved. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs even going to talk to me again after this.

I think that this issue might almost be over. Already.

I was super nervous about critiques during 6th hour, but we didn‚Äôt end up doing them because F needed to talk to IB/AP kids about exams. I was really on edge all hour. I didn‚Äôt start to loosen up till after the bell rang. I needed to ask him if I should turn in my 20 pieces today or not. It took me a minute because a bunch of other people were asking him stuff. After I put away my pieces, he asked if I was staying after school today. I said not for long, I had to get to work. He said he was just gonna test print a shirt real quick but if I had to leave then I should. I told him I could stay for like 25 more mins. The room was empty for like one minute while he was getting the stuff out. He said that he got my email. I told him I was sorry it was so long, he said it was totally fine. He asked if I had gotten a pass from the social worker yet. I said yeah. He asked if I talked to her today. I said yeah, kinda. Then Claire came out of the dark room and we didn‚Äôt talk about it. I helped him print the shirt. We talked a tiny bit. It felt like things could be normal again. But I could tell he wanted to tell me something more. This incident hasn‚Äôt yet been completely buried. He left to go do something or another and I left because I needed dad to pick me up so I could get home in time to change for work.

When I got home I messaged him asking about art club stuff for tomorrow. He said we could try something I asked him about. And he said ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll talk more tomorrow.‚Äù I think in reference to what happened. I said we should brainstorm stuff for next year soon. And I apologized for not being on top of things lately regarding art club, and stuff in general. He said it was okay. That art club was probably pretty much done for this year and we can just use the time to try some fun stuff out. I told him I was glad he felt the same way about it as I did. And thanked him.

I was really glad I messaged him. I feel a lot more confident now. I just want things to go back to normal. But I just need to know what‚Äôs going on inside his head about what happened. Then I can rest easy.

It was school night at work. But it was worse because it was my old elementary school. I didn‚Äôt know anyone, but still. People can be such high maintenance. When I got home, my new magazine was there. I read most of it, and ate dinner. Oh! Also, I stepped on the scale and I‚Äôm down to 221! I think I can make it to the teens soon! I‚Äôve lost 14 pounds so far! Holy crap! All this worrying has made me not want to eat. Maybe I should be this anxious all the time and get skinny. Lmao.

Tomorrow will be a better day. Things are going to be okay now."

Time for another post. I relapsed today which sucks but I am trying not to worry about it. I told Her about and She didn't seem to get that upset. She did seem to get upset with me a little bit just now because She feels that I think that She doesn't do enough around the apartment but that's just not true and Idk where it came from to be honest. I have to study some more tomorrow morning. I have a big final exam tomorrow that has a whole lot of bullshit content on it. Work was fine today, I also learned that I don't have to work on Friday which will give me more time to prep for my finals (so close to being done!). Alright, that's all for now."

I‚Äôm a bit confused. Never got called to the counselors office once today. Not a word from F either of course. But he said he wouldn‚Äôt bring it up either.

By the time 5th hour rolled around, I was pretty chill. I wasn‚Äôt very anxious at all. I thought I was gonna be sick for a while in first hour, but I got over it. I was starving by the time it was lunch. But I didn‚Äôt feel like eating a full one.

We just critiqued during class today. It was okay for the first two, but after that it was an absolute drag. He tried to make everyone talk once. Even me. He‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWhat do you think (me)?‚Äù I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI dunno, the colors look nice.‚Äù And I‚Äôd say the same thing for just about each one. By the time zine club rolled around I was super super anxious. I noticed I was picking and scratching at my arm and hand a ton. I couldn‚Äôt stop moving or touching my face. It was bad. I wasn‚Äôt a complete wreck, but I was not normal. I think F noticed, but not really.

I was still shocked I never got called down to the counselors. Maybe F really did have my back. But I think he wants me to go talk to her. But he hasn‚Äôt said anything since I messaged him Friday. River spent the whole meeting drawing a portrait of Logan for a log appreciation zine. Then as we were about to leave, J and Grace came in with two people and were talking about filming some movie documentary thing about anxiety and depression. I almost laughed at how ironic it was. F looked really frustrated because he had to leave to go pick up his son but these people were here. He ended up just saying I gotta go, I‚Äôll come back later, I have to anyways for some health thing I‚Äôve gotta be here for tonight. And then he took off down the hallway. I never got to talk to him. Of course. I thought there for a moment I should sit outside on the steps and not text dad until he‚Äôs already come back. But I went to go outside and dad was already there. So I texted him and told him we were working late today. So he went to go pick up my sister and then came back around 4:30. I thought for a moment of waiting around to talk to Fink inside about what I needed to say. But then after a while I realized I just did NOT have the courage. And I‚Äôd screw things up. I realized then I could email him explaining everything and use that as my excuse.

So I went home. Spent like 2 hours writing and proofreading and rewriting an email to him. It was 6:40 before I actually sent it. I don‚Äôt expect him to email back really. It was long and weird. Well, I might as well paste it here.

‚ÄúI wasn't sure whether emailing, or messaging you through group me would be more appropriate for this, but since this was longer I figured email would be better. (I'm really sorry if that was a bad assumption!)

I wanted to get some things off my chest regarding what happened Thursday, but I never ended up getting a chance. I tried to stick around after school today but I just got too nervous and I know how busy you are, so I feel just terrible taking up so much of your time. I get really anxious about initiating conversations, and no matter how hard I try, I've never been able to fully express what I mean to say verbally. My mouth always chooses the wrong words, and I always end up saying something weird I didn't intend on. Anyways, I really did mean to tell you this in person, not some email. I just have not been able sleep well, or stop consistently thinking about what happened Thursday, and how I never really cleared things up.

I just want you to know that I've been pretty much clean from doing that type of thing for months now. I'm really embarrassed it was you who had to find out. I look up to you a lot, and I really don't want some stupid thing I've struggled with to be what defines me. I know you probably don't think that, but I'm just afraid. What you saw was just a small relapse. School stress, and some dreams I had just really hit me hard last week. But that was just a fluke, I really have been able to quit. I only wore shorts last week because I was feeling a lot more comfortable, and I was 100% sure that they completely covered both my legs. They were fine through two family dinners, school, car rides, even the orthodontist. I was stupid and just flat out forgot because I was having such a good day and enjoying the nice weather. I believe I can honestly say that art, you and your classes, and having great friends around got me out of a really dark place I was in. And I'll always be forever grateful for that. I've been doing so much better lately, I'm still going through some stuff, but I don't rely on self harm to deal with my problems anymore.

Thats why I really don't want the counselors/social worker talking to my dad/step mom. I just feel like there is no real need to. I'm 16, and I feel like school has no right to break confidentiality for a resolved issue such as this. This was in the past, and I was proud of being able to get over it without really anyone finding out until now. I know I complain about my dad too much, and I know he cares for me, he just can be totally ignorant though. We were in the car today with my sister and somehow unrelated, they got on the subject of school counselors. My sister asked about what they even do besides your schedule, and my dad just said they deal with the ""snowflakes."" I knew what he meant, but I asked him to clarify, he said people who think they're special and want everyone else to solve their ""problems."" This, and many other reasons are why I can't tell him at this point in my life. There really is a huge stigma around mental health with my dad because he divorced my mom because of her many mental health issues. On top of that my family's religious beliefs just would complicate things even further. I'd never hear the end of it, I'd be treated differently for a very long time. I know you don't need this info, and can't do anything with it, but I really just want to try and do everything in my power to prevent the school having to telling my dad. There really is just no need to stir up old issues.

I'm sorry this is SO long! I feel really badly about all of this. But at the end of the day, please don't see me for any worse than I already am. I understand if you do, and again I feel awful about writing you this long thing. I just really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for being such a good teacher and person, and for being there for me.‚Äù

I bet he thinks I‚Äôm over dramatic now. Probably. I really doubt I‚Äôll talk to the counselor this week now. You‚Äôd think if this was important to them, they‚Äôd have contacted me about it by now. Especially since F said that she said she‚Äôd talk to me. Maybe she‚Äôs on vacation. Who knows? I really don‚Äôt want to have to talk to her now. I solve my own issues.

I‚Äôm not looking forward to tomorrow. Work, critiques, whatever the aftermath of that email is, who knows. I‚Äôm just in for a mess."

I‚Äôm so scared. I can‚Äôt wait. Not that I‚Äôm excited. It‚Äôs just that the wait is killing me. I literally CAN‚ÄôT wait. I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt think about anything other than what will happen tomorrow.

I think I figured out why I was never called to see the school social worker on Friday. I think F must‚Äôve emailed the wrong counselor. Apparently the school is rich enough to afford two social workers. AND NONE OF THEM THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TALK TO THE KID WHOS MOTHER DIED OVER SUMMER BREAK. FUCK THEM.

Anyways, I‚Äôm just positive I‚Äôll get a pass tomorrow. Man... I really hate how well I am at masking my emotions. I‚Äôm really good at that... almost manipulative. Shit, I‚Äôm turning into mom. Oh god. Oh my god. Everything makes sense. She died and now I‚Äôve got bits of her anxiety, bipolar, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Where I go downhill is if I‚Äôm medicated. I must not let myself be medicated. I will not let myself be medicated any thing whatsoever. Ever. Listen to me, future self, if you‚Äôre reading this. You CANNOT let yourself be put on meds like mom. You know what that did to her. There‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs not here right now to tell you.

I‚Äôm losing my sanity. This anxiety is making me want to cut more, not stop. But I‚Äôve gotta suppress and fake it for a while. Shit. The cuts were on my legs. I hope to god I don‚Äôt have to show anyone tomorrow... or ever. I miss cutting. It‚Äôs only been half a week and I‚Äôm already nothing without it.

But remember, your story is that you cut yourself when your mom died because you felt alone and numb. You didn‚Äôt know who you were without the pain of her loss. You felt like you didn‚Äôt deserve to be happy. So you cut yourself for punishment. And soon you cut yourself for every negative thing that happened. Finally you were able to stop around New Years. You quit. Threw away your pencil sharpener blades. You were clean. Here‚Äôs where the lie kicks in. You stopped, pretty much completely rid yourself of impulses. You are happy and high on life. You love your school. Your family. Your church. You are no longer saddened by moms death. You are happy. The cuts that F saw were only a tiny relapse. Why? Because you dreamt mom faked her death and was still alive, combined with the stress from the 20 pc. project.

You are gonna fucking get through this you hear me? You tell that social worker you are 16, and there is no need to contact dad. And if she says she has to, ask her if you can wait until your scabs are gone in a week. And if all goes wrong, if she has to tell dad, then you DO NOT fuck it up the rest of the day. And you tell F what you planned to.

You tell him you wore shorts because you were finally getting over it, that you were just ready for nice weather, that you thought it covered your leg completely. You tell him you don‚Äôt do ‚Äúthat‚Äù anymore like you used to. That what he saw was a small slip up after a few months of being clean. Tell him you‚Äôre sorry he had to be a part of this. You fucking apologize.

But instead of talking to myself in the third person, I‚Äôm just gonna cry now probably have a small panic attack. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll fuck everything up tomorrow. I usually do."

All I can think about is when he saw. ‚ÄúHey (me), what‚Äôs on your leg?‚Äù I keep saying it over and over until I get the right tone, pitch, and speed. Just so it haunts me. And it does. I feel it weighing over me. Like a virus that‚Äôs infected my thoughts. Good and bad. ‚ÄúWhat was that on your thigh?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen did you do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow long have you been doing that?‚Äù And on and on. I can see his face. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs disappointment, or sadness, confusion, or frustration.

I know deep down he wants to help. That‚Äôs who he is. Maybe we both think it‚Äôs too awkward to talk about. I bet he thinks I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt blame him. I definitely gave off that vibe. But at the same time I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt need to know these things about me.

I want to tell him something on Monday. Not a lot. Just something to end this mess. I wanna tell him I‚Äôd never meant for anyone to ever see that, especially him.. and that I just wore shorts because I thought they covered my leg there and it was so nice out etc. I want to tell him that I want him to know that I don‚Äôt do that anymore, this time was just a small slip up.

But I‚Äôm scared. Scared that I‚Äôll end up talking to the counselor before his class. I‚Äôm scared it will end horribly. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be in no place emotionally to talk to him. I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt have a chance on Monday. I‚Äôm so scared of dad finding out.

Work helped clear my mind. I‚Äôm going to shower now and try to rehearse what I‚Äôll say... go over Thursday again.. and maybe cry.

I was so tired last night. J and I got into another fight because he threatened to kill himself even though he knows I‚Äôm not mentally capable of dealing with that at the moment. I had a panic attack and then he tried to force me to open up to him even though I know he isn‚Äôt mentally capable of helping me either.

He always begs me to let him help and then immediately proves that he can‚Äôt. Then he gets upset when I deny him. I feel so useless, not being able to support him anymore.

He can‚Äôt even seem to take any of this seriously either. He made a joke during the whole ordeal. I said, ‚ÄúStop it, this isn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù to which he replied, ‚ÄúBooo‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt texted him back since last night even though he apologized after a while of my silence. I‚Äôm afraid of what I might say to him.

He always does that. He always messes up and apologizes only to make the same mistakes over and over again. I don‚Äôt know how much of that I can take. He asked me to forget he said anything, as if that helps at all. How can I just forget it?"

The day after...

I woke up paranoid. I could barely breath. I just lay there clutching my pillow. I rehearsed my lies and lines in my head in case I had to talk to the social worker, or to F. I wore pants and long sleeves today. Definitely will NOT be wearing shorts or my dress any time soon.

I tried to keep myself together all morning. I felt like everyone was watching me. When I walked, I felt the air literally pass through me. It was like my soul had drifted so far from my body. I was an anxious zombie. Anxious. All day long. I couldn‚Äôt stop bouncing my leg. When I started it just kept going like my anxiety would just trickle down my legs and out of my toes if I did it long and hard enough. Even now I can‚Äôt get my foot to stop moving.

I started to tear up in math. Accidentally made eye contact with Mrs. L. She asked me to come see her. I grabbed my scratch paper from the quiz and handed it to her and she asked me to come out in the hall with her. Something about math. She asked if I was okay, it this was about her class. I reassured her it was not. Later Gib asked what she talked to me in the hall about. I just said it was about me being gone yesterday. Good save not gonna lie. I made the big mistake of spilling the tea around my moms death around him and Brook. Now they know everything, kind of.

By the time it was 5th hour I was doing fine. I had been so paranoid of having to talk to the social worker, and nothing had happened yet. Although every time someone opened a door my eyes automatically looked to see who it was. I felt like I was on some sort of drugs. So anxious. By the end of 5th hour I started realizing what was going to happen the rest of the day. Then I got super anxious again. All day long I could stop thinking about what he said. ‚ÄúHey (me). What was that on your leg?‚Äù I start shaking at the thought.

So I went down to lunch. I was in no shape to eat. My stomach was churning. Plus I didn‚Äôt want to risk running into him in the cafeteria. I sat in the hall. Hugging my knees close to my chest. Someone asked me if I was okay. Just said my stomach hurt... which wasn‚Äôt a complete lie. River made a car for one of the hundreds of Mardi Gras babies that have been hidden around the school. It was the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I laughed like I‚Äôve never laughed before.

Then the bell rang. It was time for 6th hour. Eventually I‚Äôd have to face F today. I just kinda sat there staring into the distance all scrunched up. I couldn‚Äôt really focus. Sometime later he came in, mentioned something about our 20 pc. project, and talked about the art show. He asked different people if they‚Äôve submitted anything, then he suddenly became really interested in making sure I‚Äôve submitted lots of stuff. I couldn‚Äôt get the words out of my mouth to tell him I‚Äôd already submitted a handful of things yesterday. Then he came over and sat in the seat next to me. He asked if I had all 20 pieces of my art done. I said no. He asked how close I was. Not very. He asked how many I got done. 12.. if I watercolored two of these cyanotypes. He suggested I should submit my large cyanotype and my flower print. That‚Äôs when I told him I already submitted a lot. He said I should do these too. He asked if I was going to make more cyanotypes. I said I guess so. He said I should print out more of my pictures and make cyanotypes. So I did. He let me use his computer, which I now know the password to. He gave it to me yesterday. So I sat down by the printer and printed out some negatives. I had to ask where the paper was I was cutting yesterday was. The paper I was cutting when he.. saw. He said was on top of the cabinet. So I got it down. Sure enough it was there. So I took my paper, went into the changing room. And went to work. I made three cyanotypes before the end of 7th hour. But the last one wouldn‚Äôt take much more time.

Then it was after school. Grace was in there talking to him for half an hour or so. I just sat in the changing room. I was so tired I sat down and let my head rest on the table, and kind of eavesdropped. Some time later when she left, he knocked on the door and asked if I was okay. He said he hadn‚Äôt heard me working. I just said I spaced out a bit. He asked how many I‚Äôve made. I said I‚Äôve just got one more to do. So he left to go to the bathroom or something and I made my last cyanotype. I stood in front of the timer for 7 minutes just watching the hands go in circles. Then I tentatively opened the door to go rinse off my last print. He asked if it went okay. Then when I was hanging it up to dry he asked if I had went to see the social worker today. I just said no and turned away and tried to ignore his question. He went to put my 12 things away, and I shyly asked if I could have two of the cyanotypes to watercolor. He said sure. Then I asked what drawer they went in.

I tried to hurry and grab my bag. He looked at me and said that he was sorry to bring it up again, but that he wanted me to know two things. He cares about me. That he doesn‚Äôt want anything happening to me. Then he said he also doesn‚Äôt want this to come between us. He said he really enjoys my company and making art in here together etc. He said he hopes I‚Äôm not mad at him. I said I wasn‚Äôt. He said he won‚Äôt bring it up anymore if I don‚Äôt want to. I said I was sorry a bunch more. Then he tried to end things on a positive note by talking about a concert he was going to. I laughed a little. I went to head out the door. He said to have a good weekend. I gave a very muffled bye. I‚Äôm not even sure I heard myself say it.

I almost burst into tears when I got around the corner in the hallway. I texted dad and went to go sit on the steps. He got there quicker than I thought. F hadn‚Äôt even gotten in his car yet. I wiped away my tears and put on my normal happy routine. But I was exhausted. We went to go pick up my sister. I kept looking our the rear view mirror to see if F was behind us because I know he goes to the same place we were to pick up his son. For a while he was two cars behind us. Then disappeared.

I got home and just collapsed on my bed. After a while I felt like I didn‚Äôt communicate things very well to F. I considered emailing him something, but then I realized emailing would be weird because I always just message him on group me. I told him that BTW, I was not mad at him at all, and to please not think that. And I really don‚Äôt see the point in talking to a social worker I don‚Äôt even know. I thanked him and told him I was sorry for him having to be involved with this. He replied later when I got off work and was watching TV.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not angry with me. Thanks for that. I don‚Äôt know exactly what happens next. I talked to Ms K and she said she‚Äôd talk to you. I don‚Äôt know what needs to happen next. Did she send you a pass and you didn‚Äôt go?

FYI- I‚Äôm up in ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî at a concert so I may not respond. I promise I‚Äôm not avoiding you! Maybe let‚Äôs talk about it more on Monday. I‚Äôll let you lead. If you don‚Äôt want to talk, I won‚Äôt bring it up. Try to have a good weekend. Everything will be OK.‚Äù

I told him that I did not receive a pass today. I thanked him for being there for me. I apologized and told him to enjoy his concert. He replied;

‚ÄúThanks. Hopefully I can still hear tomorrow! And don‚Äôt be sorry. I know you feel bad. But it‚Äôs OK. Things will work out.‚Äù

He keeps saying it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not okay. Things won‚Äôt work out. Things will never be totally the same. I know this is for the best. I did want him to know about my SH, and I got my wish. I just wanted him to know I was in pain. I felt so alone in this struggle and I needed the person I admired the most to know. He‚Äôs a mentor to me. More than any one else. I strive to be like him someday.

I‚Äôm just so nervous now. He said he won‚Äôt bring this up again unless I do. But that‚Äôs my weakness. My biggest fucking weakness. I DO NOT. Bring things up. Ever. I would never tell him I‚Äôm struggling. I would never tell him I‚Äôve got a problem with something. I cut my fucking thigh up and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù exposed it. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking in the moment‚Äî but I did it regardless. So now I‚Äôm the kid who self harms for attention, although it didn‚Äôt used to be that way. I want to talk to him. I just want to clarify things. Clarify that I only wore shorts because I thought they wouldn‚Äôt show. Clarify that I‚Äôm not mad at him. Clarify that my dad can ABSOLUTELY NOT KNOW. I hope a time comes up for me to talk. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be called into counseling before his class on Monday. That will be a whole new shit show. It‚Äôs either going to go really well, or god-awful.

Oh. And Logan made me a ring. The most thoughtful gift I‚Äôve ever received. I love it. I love him. He‚Äôs such a great friend. Him and Jeana. Love them all.

So now I‚Äôm going to try to be calm. What a mess I‚Äôve dug myself into."

My brother filmed an interview with me tonight. It‚Äôs for his adolescent psychology class in college. I think it went pretty well.

Mr. F made another snide comment about my religion. I don‚Äôt hate him because he‚Äôs Catholic. I hate him because he uses his religion as an excuse to be an asshole.

We started a new project in art recently where we re-draw children‚Äôs drawings with our own twists and write stories for them. Mr. P read mine to the class and they said it was scary. I take that as a win.

I met up with the school psychologist today. That wasn‚Äôt fun.

I cut some of the meat off of the deer rib I took from that decomposing buck. Then I sanded it down. It‚Äôs in salt right now so the remaining skin and meat will dry up and scrape off later. I want it to look nice because I‚Äôm giving it to someone as a gift in October.

J is getting on my nerves. He says things and then when I ask him to explain he goes around in circles with nonsensical things until eventually saying exactly what he‚Äôd said before and getting angry when I tell him he didn‚Äôt explain anything.

How does that work?"

I told Her about my relapse the other day and edging too. Didn't tell Her why I had a breakdown the other day per say but I don't think I need to. I don't think it really helps anything in our relationship (as long as my anxiety goes away eventually). I didn't do any homework today and I have to go to the city tomorrow to do scary stuff that I am really not looking forward to. I played a lot of different video games today and had fun doing it! I tried like 3 different single player games and enjoyed all of them (although the last one I barely played).

He knows about my SH...

It was a normal class period. I made a huge cyanotype, the bell rung for class to get out, I went over to the sink to wash out my cyanotype. F thought it was awesome. I felt so proud that he liked something I made. A photograph even. He even took a video of me putting in the hydrogen peroxide. Some time passes, I asked if I could stay and finish up making two more for my project. He said sure.

I was tearing the paper down to size when I had my leg up on the chair for added support for when I was tearing. F was sitting at the table in the front and looked up to tell me something and that‚Äôs when he saw my thigh. I tried to not freak out and I put my leg down and pulled my shorts down subtly and went to line up my ruler when he said, ‚ÄúHey (me) what‚Äôs on your leg?‚Äù I just kinda stood there looking at him and and went ‚Äúhmm?‚Äù Like I had no idea what he was talking about. He said ‚ÄúWhat was that on your thigh?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh... nothing‚Äî I just.. I...‚Äù and silence from me. I was shaking. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I couldn‚Äôt get words out of my mouth. He asked when I did ‚Äúthose.‚Äù I stood there shaking and dumbly said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.. a few weeks ago. A lie, it was last night.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He asked if anyone knew, if my dad knew. He asked how long I‚Äôd been doing this. I said since Octoberish. I told him I‚Äôve stopped. I told him I‚Äôd never do it again. He confessed he didn‚Äôt really know what to do. He wanted to help but didn‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt blame him. I told him my sister found out, he kept asking what she said, what she did. He said he wanted me to know that he doesn‚Äôt feel different about me in any way, that this doesn‚Äôt change how he sees me. He said I was really talented and a great person etc. He said he cares about me. And when he said he didn‚Äôt see me any differently I believed him. I do. I just realize now that this was something he should not know about me. I confessed this year has been really hard. He said he knew this year has been hard on me. I don‚Äôt know if he knows the specifics. But I have a feeling he does. He asked if I‚Äôve ever talked to a therapist or counselor or anything. The answer was no. He said they could really help. Someone that wasn‚Äôt my parents or my sister or my friends, or a teacher. And maybe he‚Äôs right. But now I‚Äôm sitting here thinking of what lies to tell the counselor tomorrow when I know that‚Äôll just leave me more broken.
He asked what my dad would do if he found out. I didn‚Äôt know how to answer that honestly. Because I don‚Äôt know. I told him he‚Äôd never trust me. That I‚Äôve worked so hard to be trusted and I‚Äôve finally got it. He seems to think my dad would be okay, and not get mad.

He said that he‚Äôd send an email to the counselor saying that a student of his was cutting themselves, and that if they went in to talk to a counselor, if they‚Äôd have to tell their parents or not. He asked if that was fair. It was more than fair. I thanked him. I told him I was sorry. I told him I was sorry he had to see that, get involved with this. He kept reassuring me.

Things got quiet and I hurried into the changing room to start on my prints. I stood there for a few minutes, just processing. I wasn‚Äôt even hardly crying. ‚ÄúHe knows, he finally fucking knows.‚Äù I thought. He knocked on he door after a few minutes to ask me something about the darkroom. I answered. I still could barely move. But I made myself make those two prints I needed done before tomorrow. I could barely use my hands. I felt drained. Empty. I had to come out to ask him for some more tape. He said he was sorry to ruin such a good day. I told him it wasn‚Äôt his fault.

I went back in and made my print. I brought it out to wash it out. He acted like nothing had happened. I was still teary eyed and couldn‚Äôt really talk back normally. I told him I was sorry again. I wanted to tell him I was sorry it had to be him to find out. I didn‚Äôt. I went back in to make my other print. I didn‚Äôt have much time. I sat in there for 7 minutes while my paper exposed. Then he knocked on the door and came in saying he had to go pick up his son now or else he‚Äôd be late. I told him all I needed to do was wash it out. He said that was fine and I washed it out.

I kept telling him I was sorry. I was so sorry. I hurried and grabbed my things and left. He said he‚Äôd see me tomorrow. I said bye. And I quickly walked down the hall.

I was trying to keep my cool, when I saw Lilah so I went to go talk to him.

The rest is normal. I can‚Äôt believe he saw. I can‚Äôt believe this is happening. This can‚Äôt be happening. I want to die.

I lay here wondering if he‚Äôs worried about me. I don‚Äôt want him to. Did he tell his wife? I would in his situation, but still. I feel embarrassed. Will he talk to me tomorrow? Will the counselor call me out of class? I‚Äôm so scared. I really don‚Äôt want my family finding out. I know he will think of me differently. Not worse maybe. But differently. He said he wouldn‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs just plain impossible. I wonder if he realizes that all the times I‚Äôve cried or looked sad in his class, that I went home and cut myself. Will he connect dots? God I sure hope not. But I kind of do.

I guess I‚Äôll report what happens tomorrow. I‚Äôm pretty nervous. I just can‚Äôt get his sad face out of my head."

What a strange feeling it is to find out that you've been hacked.

I had that experience this morning, just as me & the wife were getting ready for work.

Already in a daze having just woke up & not really having my wits about me,¬†

you can imagine the¬†horror when I saw my bank account reading -$458.¬†

I was supposed to have at LEAST $80.00 left, which was to last me

until Friday when I can mooch of the Wife's Payday. But there it was. 458 fucking dollars in the hole.

Even before I found who the culprit was, I knew I'd been hacked.

Sure enough, I check my history & some asshole had hacked my Pay Pal

& managed to rack up nearly $1000.00 worth of fraudulent charges.

Fortunately, living close to the edge, as most people in my income bracket are prone to do,

I had only $80.00 they could grab, but still. I needed that money to live.

After I got over the hysterics & sick to my stomach feeling, not to mention having downed

an energy drink, I was able to eventually step back & analyze the situation & I got to thinking;

Considering we have been dealing in digital currency for pretty much at least, the last 20 YEARS,

& possibly even longer, combined with the sheer staggering numbers of hackers that are out there,

it was almost an inevitability I get hit. The numbers alone bear this out.

that being said, it still doesn't make it any easier, knowing you've been a victim of online fraud.

The feeling of both panic & anger, to say nothing of the feeling of being violated. Of having¬†

your financial¬†security ripped out from under you, temporarily at least.

So, as I'm taking the bus to work, my mind trying to process the whole thing,

I inevitably got to feeling sorry for myself. Pondering the predictable questions like; Why me?

What have I done to deserve this, etc.

Althewhile our bus passing Homeless people huddled in doorways on this cold & rainy morning.

And for the briefest of moments, I was able to step outside of myself & look at the bigger picture.

Yes, I was out $80.00, but there was a better than good chance I would have that back before the end of the day.

Yes, I had been violated, but they didn't get much, if anything from me.

Yes, I was going to have to forgo Breakfast, but I'm trying to lose weight, & it's not like I couldn't skip a meal or two.

Meanwhile, as I said, I'm seeing Homeless people on the streets, many of whom are mentally ill. Far worse than I.

Some probably can't even REMEMBER the last time they even saw what a $20.00 bill looks like.

I have my lovely wife, who ALWAYS has my back. In SO many ways.

So while I may be out a few bucks & a breakfast, in some ways...I'm the luckiest sonofabitch alive."

Things might change soon. I accidentally updated my phone to the new software update that features ‚Äúscreen time.‚Äù Big mistake on my part, considering it gives my parents access to what apps I use, for how long, at what time, and even what websites I go to and how long. My life of phone privacy is basically over until I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm writing this on my google chrome app on the mobile website because it‚Äôs the only search engine app that doesn‚Äôt show which fucking website I go on. ALSO, I can no longer clear my search history. Which sucks because my last searches were self harm related. Now I only use safari for totally innocent searches. I had to delete reddit, iFunny, YouTube, literally the only thing I do on my phone now is instagram. Which, thank god, is all I NEED anyways.

Besides this new complication to my life, things have been pretty normal, well, normal for me. Maybe unusual would be a better word. F was gone Monday. When I saw him Tuesday he gave me a big two handed high five when I was going to the cafeteria. He made me feel appreciated. Anyways, just thought that was notable.

Today was mediocre. When I was getting off the bus I saw F get in his car and leave for his thing he was missing school for. I sat down in the cafeteria, went to 1st hour, then third then fifth. The average routine for a Wednesday. Lunch was alright. Oh, and I wore shorts today. My DIY long shorts I made from old jeans. Just the perfect length to cover my cuts/scars. But I can‚Äôt cross my legs with many people around because you can see my cuts if I do so. I may have to stop sitting cross legged all the time, this spring and summer anyways.

7th hour was okay. We had a sub, he seemed to like me. I helped him with his crossword puzzle. I planned on making a 16x20 inch Cyanotype today, with my baby knowledge of cyanotype. If I could get it to work I could really impress F. And it would be pretty damn cool looking. I got everything set up, but I ran into some printer software issues. I troubleshooted for an hour and finally gave up and emailed F. I felt bad emailing him on his day off. He responded and said the software only works on his laptop. Damn. I thanked him for his troubles and sat down and thought for a while.

Then I remembered about my copper etching I needed to do TODAY. I grabbed some copper, got Mrs. H to unlock the jewelry room and I cut my sheets down to size. I plugged in the hot plate and got my setup ready. The ball ground went on okay, until I started rolling it out. It got splotchy on the corners and was kind of uneven. There wasn‚Äôt much else I could do to fix it. It started smoking so I took it off the burner. I was able to roll it out a bit better when it was off. I did some research on the etching solution and then I made an attempt. The sub had to leave early after school so I only had enough time to let my copper etch for like 7 mins. I barely had time to clean up the ferric chloride and put my stuff together. The sub was about to leave when I realized I forgot about the hot plate and the mess in the changing room. I messaged F later to apologize in advance for the mess.

The rest of my Wednesday was typical and nothing notable happened. Although I‚Äôve been cutting my legs a lot recently for no clear reason. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm cutting because I like to look at the cuts and the blood, not because I hate myself. I do hate myself. F just does such a good job of making me NOT hate myself. I didn‚Äôt choose him. He chose me. Maybe.

I cut my legs more tonight. They‚Äôre sure noticeable, fresh cuts on my legs will be more concerning than old scars, if he even did see those anyways. I hate to be the person who cuts for ‚Äúattention.‚Äù But this is my cry for help. I‚Äôve been struggling with this since October. My legs have hundreds and hundreds of scars. Layers and layers. I‚Äôm sick, and I know it. I need help, I just can‚Äôt get it. If F sees, maybe he‚Äôll understand my pain. Maybe my hurting will make sense. I don‚Äôt know. But if he sees, I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôll tell counseling or not. If they find out, most likely they‚Äôll tell my parents. And to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôd do. They would treat me like an outsider, that‚Äôs for sure. My freedoms would become increasingly limited. I guess I‚Äôll just blame it on moms death. That‚Äôs the root of all my problems this year anyways. Especially the self harm. Then maybe I can figure out what her fucking cause of death is. The exact one. ‚ÄúDying in her sleep‚Äù is not a valid conclusion.

Anyways. I‚Äôm in trouble. I‚Äôve got a LOT of work to get done tomorrow that can‚Äôt be ruined my emotional distress. But I‚Äôm willing to take the risk now, to let out these feelings I‚Äôve been bottling up since last June. Better when I‚Äôm a bit more stable than a total wreck.

God, I hate myself."

My dad and I went out into the woods to cut the head off of a dead buck today. It was mostly skull but there was a lot of skin and muscle where we had to cut on the neck. I also snagged two ribs and a femur.

Preparation for the extraction included:
1) Several pairs of strong rubber gloves
2) Dust masks and a balaclava for me
3) Strong lavender perfume
4) Two trash bags
5) A small handsaw
6) Thick twin

Once we tracked down the carcass, we started by putting on the gloves and masks. We sprayed our masks with the perfume (to ward off the stench, the buck had to have been rotting for a few months) and sprayed the surface of the body to remove the few bugs on it. I began by taking the hand saw and cutting through several layers of skin and muscle on the neck, directly under the skull. Once I got to the spinal cord, my dad took over and cut it the rest of the way.

We set the skull aside. Dad stepped away and I proceeded to cut off two ribs fairly easily with the saw. Next, I removed an entire leg at the hip joint. I then cut through another joint and retrieved the femur bone. We placed all of the bones and the skull into a trash bag, put that trash bag into another trash bag, tied off the top, and tied it again with twine.

I helped dad cut the antlers off once we got home. The buck had a beautiful spread. It‚Äôs a gorgeous set of antlers. We‚Äôre planning on picking up a plastic skull to mount them on since I want to use the real skull and dad doesn‚Äôt want to have to clean it out.

Our neighbor was nice enough to let us put it in his compost pile. We‚Äôll pull it out next year and it should be cleared off of skin and other tissues.

I‚Äôm not sure what I want to make with it. Maybe I‚Äôll fill it with some fake flowers and make a floral arrangement in it. Maybe I‚Äôll make a headpiece. Who knows? I have a year to decide.

I might post some pictures from our extraction later on."

I had some WEIRD dreams last night including being at school way into the night, Mr. A doing very gross things, and a whole lot of weird shit. Anyways, who cares. I woke up about 40 mins before I had to get ready. I started thinking about college again. Ugh. I realized I‚Äôm just not going to be able to get two years of a foreign language in. I wanna go to the art institute SO BAD. But I am.. in a way this summer. God, I‚Äôm SO excited.

Anyways I was very stressed and crying already at 10 in the morning. Not a great start. I went to work and kinda felt bad. I really just did NOT want to work today. I faked being sick around 2:00 and went home. I feel guilty, but I really just needed a break. I am so tired.

Hung around the house for a while, watched tv, cleaned my room a bit, hung some art up. Flash forward and it‚Äôs like 7 PM. I went to Starbucks to work. I was not very productive. I went to cvs and bought some makeup. I wanted to be all punk and edgy. Then after a long time of messing with it at home and getting eyeliner on my eyeball. I realized I look better in natural makeup anyways. It was still fun though.

Now it‚Äôs raining and I didn‚Äôt get hardly any art done today. I‚Äôm gonna have to go crazy tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna make the fruit posters. I‚Äôll do two other drawings instead.

I‚Äôm not gonna stress. I‚Äôm kind of sad though. Fink won‚Äôt be at school Monday. I don‚Äôt know why exactly. Maybe it has something to do with the magazine. Who knows.. I should sleep. It‚Äôs so late. Maybe I‚Äôll dream again. "

I woke up earlier than expected today. I usually sleep until a little before noon on weekends. I don‚Äôt have to go to work until 2:40 PM on Saturdays. But today I woke up at 6:00 AM. I don‚Äôt know why.

J and I got into another argument. He asked me how I was and I can‚Äôt lie to him. I never could. So I admitted that I‚Äôm not doing so great. He got mad at me. I understand that he has problems too. I get that. But I am afraid for my life as well. I told him I couldn‚Äôt take his issues on top of mine right now but he keeps pushing. I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt think he cares about me very much.

Work wasn‚Äôt so bad, though. I‚Äôm on hosting duty for the next week because I fell and hurt my hand. So no lifting trays for me. Not for a while.

J scares me. He always says he‚Äôll be better. He always apologizes just to turn around and do it again. I can‚Äôt trust him and he makes me feel bad for not trusting him. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I am scared."

I totally forgot to write last night. What a dumbass. To be fair, I didn‚Äôt get home until 10, but still...

My memory is a little fuzzy, but it was a pretty normal morning. I started on a new ink drawing during second hour. Studied for my vocab test in third hour. And 4th and 5th were boring. Mrs. H wants me to do the softball poster, AND, some huge project for the band. I don‚Äôt really want to, but I don‚Äôt think I have much of a choice.

I took a pic of my horizontal ink drawing and posted it to insta during 6th hr. Then I just worked on my other drawing. I got about halfway done with it. Fink walked by and said my art looked like Edward Gorey‚Äôs. I had never heard of him before and so I looked it up and was deeply honored. I don‚Äôt remember what we talked about for the rest of class, I do remember talking with our table in 7th hour about deep, and existential shit. Fink liked really stressed out about something, I didn‚Äôt dare ask though. And before I knew it, class was over. I had no excuse to stay after today because MYM wasn‚Äôt happening, and it would have been weird for me to stay and do nothing. So I talked in the hall with River and log for a while. Then with log for some time more when River left. Then I remembered I needed some paper for my project over the weekend, so I went back to Finks room to grab a couple sheets. While I was getting my paper he explained to me and Log he was stressed out earlier because his favorite band is doing a concert on the night of graduation. He really wants to go, he might try and figure out a way to get out of graduation. Personally I think he should go to graduation and not be sour about it. But who cares what I think. If my favorite band was playing for the first time in a long time, I‚Äôd probably pick that. Then log left because his ride was here, and I was still getting paper rolled up.

Somehow we got to taking about AP, and college, and stuff. He started talking to me about (local university) vs (art institute) when it comes to jobs and pricing and stuff. I confessed I hadn‚Äôt considered university because of my gpa and overall stupidity. He said that (local university) had a great art program, and so I asked about their printmaking one. I told him I don‚Äôt really care WHERE I end up, as long as I have a good studio, work environment, and teachers who know their stuff and would teach me better techniques, and whole new processes. He said (local university) had a great printmaking program, and that the teachers there are awesome. And he‚Äôs right, we had some sort of art coordinator from there come in recently and he was the coolest guy ever. He knew his stuff, and was probably the best guest speaker we‚Äôve ever had. Before I left I confessed I hadn‚Äôt even really considered college as an option until earlier this year, and that I don‚Äôt know how much of it works or any of the lingo because we just never talked about it at home.

I had kind of overstayed my welcome so I started to head out the door. I thanked Fink for letting me bother him with all of this college stuff and for the paper. He said I never bothered him. I don‚Äôt know if he meant that, or if he was lying to be nice. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd lie, but I still feel like I bother him too much.

So that conversation really got me thinking A LOT. Maybe (art institute) isn‚Äôt my best option. I looked up the price difference between there and university, and that‚Äôs 35k vs 8k a year. There  are downsides to university because I wouldn‚Äôt be strictly doing art and liberal arts classes, and that sucks, but at the art institute, I‚Äôd pretty much only be taking classes I like. BUT, class sizes at the institute are way larger than university. Also, university would probably give out better scholarships compared to the institute.

Ugh this is insane. Absolutely crazy. Now I‚Äôm seriously considering university over the institute. I don‚Äôt even know anymore. My plan is to apply to everywhere and just see what happens.

I just looked now, and I would be missing a few classes that are required to get into university like two semesters of a foreign language, and one year of math. Yeesh. I don‚Äôt want to try and make that up next year. I‚Äôd have to take a year or two at community college to do that. AHHHH, this is all BS I don‚Äôt need to put in my diary.

Anyways, yesterday I went to work, and a whodunnit murder mystery, (which we solved) at church. Then that‚Äôs it. Now I have to go to work for 10 more hours. Fuck me."

Accidentally deleted what I had written and I‚Äôm pissed at myself, so here I go again.

Woke up. Lost carving tool. Went to Finks room, borrowed one. Got seminar pass. Went to math on fourth floor. Found my lost carver. Carved for the whole period. Went to seminar. Cut paper to size. Carved block for remaining time. Ate lunch in hall. Fink commented on the state of the cafeteria chicken tenders today on his way to go do something.

Ok I‚Äôm caught up. After all that I went to English and praise god, she let us watch the great Gatsby and work on whatever. Naturally I was finishing up carving my block and it was pretty hard to see with all the lights off. Kendrick looked pretty worried like I was going to accidentally cut myself with the tool. Later when we stopped the movie and turned on the lights everyone in my vicinity just HAD to comment on my linocut. Even got Mrs. S to get up and look. I was kind of embarrassed, I hate people looking at my stuff WHILE I‚Äôm making it.

Went to 6th hour and finished up the last few details of my carving. I printed with the Akua ink which always makes a mess. I made 6 prints, 4 of which turned out good. Then I set them on a different table to dry. I pulled out my little horizontal ink drawing and worked on that for the rest of class. The custodians brought in a few big boxes of stuff. Fink said they had to use up their yearly spending money, that‚Äôs why it seems like there are new packages arriving every day. He got some copper eating acid and sat it on the table in front of me. I was confused until I actually read what it was and then got really excited. APPARENTLY, he‚Äôs got the wax stuff that goes on top, I‚Äôll have to ask him about al of that tomorrow and do some research tonight.

Before I knew it class was over. I still needed to paint my prints with water color, I asked Fink if he minded if I stayed for a bit and did that, he said not at all. So I silently worked for about 30 mins until I broke the silence and asked him some follow up questions about AP art Portfolio which I asked in seminar. He said to talk to Joss, and I did during 6th hour. I told him I talked to Joss and he was confused, and then he said he meant someone totally different and he said the wrong name. I felt so stupid but so did he because that was totally his fault.

I had asked what the point of taking AP art Portfolio senior year was if college applications are due next December anyways. Which I later figured out after school is that it gives you credits in college. He also asked if I thought about any other colleges besides (main choice) and I said not really. He suggested a few others and I didn‚Äôt seem that interested at first. But it definitely got me thinking. Maybe (main college choice) isn‚Äôt the only college I‚Äôll apply to! It‚Äôs worth a shot to apply everywhere and see who gives me the best scholarships.

I finished up my water colors and left to go to magazine which I did for like 5 mins and then left because dad was there to pick me up. I feel bad for leaving early. I really just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to be editor next year. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it. Anyways, I went home. Posted a pic of my prints to Instagram. Friended Fink on Facebook because he mentioned asking about AP stuff on his Facebook so I went ahead and thought this was a good opportunity to friend him. I also posted my prints to my Facebook and he liked it :). Then I did some research about AP college creds and emailed Fink about what I‚Äôd found.

Are tacos for dinner, then packed up my sketchbook and stuff and walked to Starbucks and stayed there till like 8:30. I was able to finish the remaining 70% of my horizontal ink drawing. They messed up my drink order and gave me a large one for the wait. They‚Äôre pretty nice! I got dad to drive me home and then I showered. I also emailed my counselor about the possibility of me changing to AP Portfolio next year.

I also found a really cool artist on Instagram that makes the kind of art I want to make. After thinking and thinking I finally have a rough battle plan. Get this copper intaglio printing method with the acid figured out and mastered by the end of the school year. Make a concentration of different prints and all sorts of varieties. Go to (first college choice) for printmaking, because chances are the scholarship money for printmaking is a lot easier to get than if I were to major in Illustration. And boom, there you have it! I‚Äôm so excited. This 20 piece project had me SO stressed, but has turned out to be a blessing. I feel like an unstoppable art making powerhouse! I just can‚Äôt wait to make cool shit.

I also forgot, I got an ad on insta for a really cool original Ponyo poster and it brought back so many fond memories. It‚Äôs really nice quality, and I got the whole thing for only 9.99 and free shipping. It might take a month to get here but I‚Äôm excited for when it does.

Ok so tomorrow I need to ask Fink about the copper printing, and steal some paper for my posters I‚Äôm making Sunday. Jeez, this week has just flown by at light speed. "

Alright, time to try and start this anew. Again. I have been having a really bad time with relapsing lately. I just haven't been able to get more than a few days stringed together before having another set back. It happened again today and I also feel like my thoughts and feeling were over the place and I was checking people out and stuff today and worried if I could like/love other people and life feels hard. I don't really know what I am doing anymore it seems. But it didn't really feel this way yesterday, not bleak or whatever it is that now feels. It comes in strange waves. Still not sure how to right this ship after trying for years. I can do this. I accomplish a whole lot of stuff in life, I can conquer this too. The day was long. I am tired of school and need to work more than normal tomorrow. I feel like I didn't do a good job of listening to Her when She was telling me about Her day (which I do too often). I need to get some rest. I should get back into calorie counting and meditation. Maybe things will be easier when this semester is over, idk. On a good note, I feel like my presentation went pretty well today. I ought to do this again tomorrow."

Oh my goddd my brain is in alert mode. I am literally SO stressed. Ok focus. Recap time. This morning was normal. Started on my linoleum carving in the end of 1st hour, and worked on it all through 3rd and 5th. I started feeling really numb towards the end of 5th hour. My stomach felt empty. I felt weak, and I couldn‚Äôt talk straight in lunch. I am being physically impacted by this stress. Raegan and I just cried about it all  through lunch. I went into 7th hour pissed and tired of life and this class, which is the reason I get out of bed most mornings.

I worked on my carving and Fink suggested I use this metal thing that helps you carve on tables and it didn‚Äôt help for what I was doing. I tried to politely decline. I thought today was going to be another repeat. About midway through the class, he asked me to help him screenprint, we kind of talked while he was mixing up ink. I admitted I was pretty stressed about this project. But he seemed to think I‚Äôd do fine. He said they don‚Äôt need to be fancy at all, but I can‚Äôt NOT overachieve in his class. I just want to impress him. He said I make stuff all the time and this wouldn‚Äôt be THAT much of a challenge. He‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs not, but I‚Äôve certainly never done it before.

After school I helped him print a few prints while Henry came in to set up his 3-D printer, the same Henry who‚Äôs skateboard I fell off of last Wednesday. This time he brought a friend. And FUCKKK, these guys were driving me crazy. They could be funny at times, but they were SO annoying. Fink was obviously annoyed with the friend of Henry‚Äôs. Had to tell him to put down the staple gun like three times and a handful of other stuff. Anyways, the rest of the time was a blur. Athena messed around with my water colors. She ended up texting me later and buying the same set.

Finally he got them to leave at like 3:30 and before I left I asked him if he had found a zine I‚Äôd lost in there on Monday. He looked around for a second and gave it to me without commenting. Maybe he read it, maybe he didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know. I get why he didn‚Äôt comment if he DID read it, but still. Part of me wishes. Anyways, I left and went to stand by the doors to go outside. Fink went into H‚Äôs room to look for something and came down to the storage room which was right behind me. He asked if I could help him wheel the cart of podiums in. I did. We talked briefly about Ikea. He hates it, I love it. Then I said bye and went to wait outside on the steps. It started sprinkling when I was out there. Fink drove by as he always did and waved.

I went to the art store downtown with dad afterwards. Got a crap ton of stuff. More than I meant to get, but I don‚Äôt regret anything. I love buying art supplies. Came home, and messed with them a bit. Made some marker swatches, etc. Dad ordered pizza for dinner, then we left for church.

Church happened, boring, then I got home and finished drawing a rough sketch of what all 20 of my pieces are gonna look like. Now I‚Äôm writing this. I really need to get started on my horizontal ink drawing right now. I didn‚Äôt finish carving during class today so I‚Äôm going to have to just do that tomorrow morning since I have a late start. Tomorrow I need to print and water color over my prints, and start on a pen drawing with water color, or my markers, and think of a design.

Great."

Holy shit, today was a disaster I barely managed to save in the end. Oh my god. I woke up at 3 because my sister was sick and dad was talking in the hall. I got up and drank some water and snoozed past my alarm and didn‚Äôt have time to shower. So already my day started crappy. All the juniors took the ACT today except for me and a small handful of people because we forgot. My first hour had barely anyone. I failed my math test, and the day started out pretty typically. I ate lunch, as I usually do. Raegan said something about a 20 piece assignment in portfolio and I had no idea what she was talking about, boy was I naive.

Walked straight into 6th hour and read the board. It read something like,
Art Portfolio:
Make 20 works of art by April 12th
Only art made after 4/2
Etc.

I saw that and freaked the hell out. It didn‚Äôt really kick in until Fink came in and was like oh, btw, portfolio your next assignment is on the board. He barely gave any explanation. I freaked out. I cried like Jeana having a mental breakdown in the middle of class. I cried and cried and could barely breath. I left the room to go to the bathroom. I was having some form of a panic attack. It took me a minute to get myself together and I went back to the room, except Fink wasn‚Äôt there. He was out helping IB kids with photo shit. I was pretty mad at him.

7th hour was no better. I was still crying and just having a total breakdown. When he came back he explained the project a lot better to 7th hour. I realized I didn‚Äôt have to make 20 PERFECT, high detailed pieces of my best art. But man. I was just not having it. I cried basically the whole hour and a half. I don‚Äôt know if Fink noticed. I think he did but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Of all times not to notice. I sure wish he would have. He went into the changing room before the bell rang and I didn‚Äôt get to say bye. I just walked out of the room barely holding myself together so I could make it to the bus without sobbing. I could barely breath on the bus. I thought much of suicide. It seemed like my only option. Then to cutting. It seems pathetic now that I look back. But that was my worst break down since before winter break.

When I got home I went straight to my room and locked the door. I found a blade in my dresser and cut a bunch on my right thigh. It stung but provided instant relief. It was like instant calming. Eventually I cleaned it, got dressed and went to work. Work sucked. Three constant hours of drive thru. Never ending cars. But about halfway through my shift I began to feel better. And like this project was beginning to feel more approachable.

We ordered McDonalds and took it home to my sister. After that I showered and sat on my bed and created a list of everything I was going to make over the next 10 days. I then organized it to what day I‚Äôd make what, and a list of what supplies I need. I texted dad and asked if we could go to the art store after art club tomorrow.

Oh and I just remembered, I messaged Fink at work asking about the project. But the truth was, I really just wanted to talk to him because I didn‚Äôt all day except for signing some art club form in 6th hour. He definitely helped reassure me about this big ass project. Though I‚Äôm still kinda mad. But I look at it now like a blessing in disguise. I love showing Fink my art. This is a great opportunity to show him a crap load of stuff and not feel bad.

I just have to stick to my schedule perfectly this week and next. I may have to forcefully make myself drink some coffee to get it all done.

I literally don‚Äôt know how I recovered from that meltdown. Maybe SH helps me? I don‚Äôt even know. All I know is that my legs are fucking ugly from all these cuts and scars. "
0,"10:22 PM 4/1/19
It‚Äôs getting harder to get up in the morning again. My purpose has left me. I need a reason, even if it is some self-centered, hypocritical one. But I got up eventually. Wore that damn lobster dress.

School was shit. It always is 4th quarter. I‚Äôm so ready to be free. Even for a few months. I made what I wrote last night into a zine. Very basic except for a tiny cover illustration and some text. Kept it in my pocket all day.

Lunch came and went. I didn‚Äôt have my power project done. But neither did any one else really. My new goal is to finish it by Friday. We‚Äôre going to start a new project tomorrow. I hope this one will be good. 7th hour was the same really. I didn‚Äôt talk to Fink much at all today. Maybe like one comment during 6th hour. And that‚Äôs it.

Zine club went alright. Although I feel like I kinda let my bad side of my personality get out. The one that talks and laughs too much. I hate her sometimes. She‚Äôs just a pathetic goof.

Wanna hear the real fucked up things I did today? I sat purposely in my chair exposed my scars on my left leg to anyone standing on that side of me. Which was only Fink whenever he was at his podium. I don‚Äôt think he saw. And if he did. I doubt he‚Äôd ever say anything. He cares. But he doesn‚Äôt care enough.

The second fucked up thing I did was purposely leave my depressing ass zine on the floor where he would see it. I‚Äôm SO pathetic. But I want him to read it. Athena asked about it and I said it was nothing. I never got the chance to say goodbye. I left with the others. Went to wait outside and realized I forgot my coat. I ran back in and grabbed it and said I forgot. Still no bye. It‚Äôs ok though. I‚Äôm not even deserving of notice or love.

All these things I consciously do for Fink to notice my pain and what have been the fruits of my labor? Whenever I scheme, he just grows farther, probably thinks I don‚Äôt care.

My sister made me a scrunchie. So there‚Äôs that too. I started and finished series 2 of The OA in one day. That show is so good. Now I‚Äôm about to sleep because I‚Äôm too tired to shower. I‚Äôm hoping tomorrow will bring me some clarity. Will Fink find my zine? Has he already found it? Did he notice my scars? Find out in the next episode of my pathetic life!"

Guess who didn‚Äôt get shit done today??? This girl! I only did the art & fear reading and that‚Äôs it. I didn‚Äôt have enough time anyways to make my project. I don‚Äôt care. Hopefully Fink isn‚Äôt mad.

Today was an average Sunday.

I did, however, go to old navy and buy some clothes. I got a dress. Which is kinda risky for two reason. Firstly, I never wear dresses and EVERYONE is going to notice. Secondly, if I sit the wrong way or do something weird with my legs, anyone could see my scars... WHICH may have an advantage.

Maybe one day I‚Äôll be sitting and Fink will see them accidentally. Who knows. It‚Äôs risky, but I want to wear it tomorrow unless it‚Äôs freezing cold.

We had the ice cream fundraiser at church tonight and a few baptisms.

And I wrote a poem of sorts. It‚Äôs a little sad. But I‚Äôm considering writing it into a zine and conveniently leaving it in Fink‚Äôs room somewhere where he will find it. Here‚Äôs what I wrote:

The park I once treaded with tiny feet
Stained crimson by death's messenger
A bitter letter delivered to two daughters
Of divorce and brainwashed insanity

See now what pain you've brought
To the child who loved her most
My sister cries aloud false wails
I eat the earth to keep from choking

A hollow hand creeps up my spine
The unfamiliar marital replacement
for death's newly appointed spokesman
Fickle condolences fall from her lips

Tell me this isn't real‚Äî this isn't so
The one who granted me life
Has been ripped of her own‚Äî alone
My dear mother, how I cry for you!

Vague answers and devious grandparents
Leave me shattered and torn
Left me in the dark like they did, you
Your voice has left my memory

Pictures can never capture what we had
All videos are out of my hands
All I have left are your words.
And the fleeting remnants of 16 years

Anyways. It‚Äôs vague and angsty and shit. I‚Äôm gonna do something with it tomorrow morning. I really hope to god Fink won‚Äôt be disappointed in me for not finishing. I‚Äôll act like I feel like shit.

ITS TIME I GET THIS OFF MY CHEST."

Today was another day I‚Äôll never remember. Except for the fact that I write things down here. Woke up, watched a few episodes of season 3 of the Santa Clarita diet, and went to work. Trained two new kids, one of which I couldn‚Äôt even pronounce their name. They were kind of annoying because they seemed so uninterested. Rest of the day was boring. Came back home and watched more tv and finished the rest of the season. Damn having a normal job must SUCK!

I started thinking recently about me wanting to be an editor of the magazine. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck a villanelle is, or know how many syllables a haiku has off the top of my head. I‚Äôve got all my chips in the art department, not the writing side. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll disappoint Mrs. A. I hope to god she doesn‚Äôt want me being editor next year. I‚Äôd love to be involved, but I just don‚Äôt want to be in charge.

But things might change, as they always seem to do. I‚Äôve been realizing how much I want to get back in touch with my writing/reading side. I want to make a zine. A bi-weekly type of thing maybe. Ugh. It‚Äôs too risky, having my free flowing thoughts potentially leave the classroom. Schools almost over anyways, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to let my sister get her hands on my writing next year. Ugh. My sister. A whole new bag of rocks to deal with next year. I‚Äôm so worried I won‚Äôt be able to be myself at school anymore. She‚Äôs a total snitch. I love her and hate her all at the same time. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm gonna do.

All I know is that I want to get in touch with myself more. I want to be MORE in touch with my emotions which is scary but could lead me down interesting paths. And I‚Äôd have time to do that without stressing if I take more off my plate.

I can do this. I can do it. Just gotta finish my project tomorrow. "

I‚Äôm gonna start setting less unrealistic goals so I don‚Äôt feel like a failure all the time. My only basic goals right now are to pass my classes, finish my high school portfolio by November, save for a nice workspace in my room, and work on my figure drawing capabilities.

I just gotta take things slow. I‚Äôve got time. I can do this. Don‚Äôt worry about making a lot of stuff, worry about making good quality stuff. Fink doesn‚Äôt give a shit about HOW much I make, just how well.

Focus on your future. Focus on your mind. Not the day to day.

But since I‚Äôm a fool and I focus on the day to day, today was pretty boring. Woke up at 11, we went on a short thunderstorm chase. Came back, ate lunch, I messed around for a bit. Asked my sis if I could take photos of her as a drawing reference and she complied. Went to work, came home, ate dinner and watched the x-files. Today was boring, I wish I could have gone to school, but on the other hand, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten those photos of my sis.

I think I want to turn that brown empty book I got for cheap into a practice figure drawing book. I could do my sketchbook, but I only want nice things in there. This book will literally be shit and that‚Äôs OK.

I wish I could go out on the porch like at our rental porch and just sit there and listen to the rain and music. But we don‚Äôt have a porch anymore which really sucks. I don‚Äôt want to go to bed yet but I should. Netflix just came out with season 3 of the Santa Clarita diet and I really wanna watch it right now. Probably might do that then pass out.

Just focus. De-stress. "

Sometimes I feel like I live at school. I can‚Äôt wait for next year. No math class, just English, SS, Science and a whole lotta art. Woke up at 7 and drew a dumb little mushroom drawing to turn into a screen print. I finished the sketch before I got to school. I went in to get a seminar pass from Fink. I was kinda nervous. We reviewed in math but I mostly worked on inking my drawing. Went to Finks room for seminar. He said he had to go to some teacher meeting in the office. I coated a screen, printed with the frog screen. Cleaned off the failure one, and when I was cleaning out the one that didn‚Äôt fail I accidentally got some of the emulsion remover on it and ruined it, so I cleaned the rest of it off and finished up like 10 mins into lunch. Went to lunch. River was already sitting at a full table so I sat with Alex and talked about life. Went to English and we made a vision board.

Then finally went to 6th hour. It was senior skip day so it was literally just us juniors. I sat down, started peeling an orange, while the rest of my table acted like hilarious idiots. We started making figure drawings of Henry that soon evolved into him t-posing/dancing on the table to Minecraft parodies and some Italian pizza song. It was funny but Fink seemed a bit annoyed. I finished up my drawing, and he helped me print it on film after I scanned and vectorized it. I then exposed and washed out my screen and it worked pretty damn well. By the time I was done class was about over.

Chinese club had a 5$ potluck type thing after school so I went to that with Henry. It was alright. Finished by 4ish and grabbed a cookie on my way out. I went back to Finks room to print my screen. I printed it on paper first with red ink. It would have been the perfect time for him to notice my wrist but no, he didn‚Äôt see my fuckin bruise. I also printed on a T-shirt he gave me. He told me that my 300$ scholarship was put into my account and it was all good to go. I told him thanks again and he said it really was his pleasure. When I was cleaning out my screen we talked about rain and radar apps and porches and leaky houses. Then I beat it to the super long magazine meeting.

We just rated submissions and shit. Pretty boring. I was in a group with Ian. Mrs. A talked to me a bit. I told her I wasn‚Äôt able to do any cadet teaching next year for her. But I told her I‚Äôd definitely be in the magazine. She asked if I had thought about teaching art, and where etc. I seriously considered it there for a second. Nope. I don‚Äôt want to teach at a high school. Not even a college. MAYBE speciality classes, but I do NOT want to be a teacher. But I won‚Äôt totally shut the idea out. We ordered pizza and it was ok. On the way out I checked Instagram. Fink posted a pic of the screen he finally figured out the printing setup with ‚Äúa lot of help from one of my brilliant students‚Äù (obviously a nod to me) I was so happy, what an absolutely kind compliment. I didn‚Äôt get home until 7:10ish.

He posted a pic of my T-shirt on the school art department insta. My glitter came in the mail. I took a bunch of insta stories comparing my fingernail polish, my shoes, and my new bag of glitter which happened to match to a tee. I decided to work on a stamp and I started making one of a leaf. Spent an hour or so working on that and I decided to go to bed because I‚Äôm pooped out.

Today wasn‚Äôt emotional. Which is ok. If every day was emotional I‚Äôd be worn out. I need to start my power project tomorrow for real. I‚Äôm exhausted I‚Äôm gonna sleep now. Maybe I‚Äôll dream. "

I did some schoolwork until i took a nap and then i woke up with a headache. i continued my schoolwork but couldn't absorb any information. Sunday is almost here and im slacking big time. i have to get it done and over with. i just never found a  way to study. Its easy to highlight words in the reader mode but there is no way to transfer it to another word doc. something has to give.

next Saturday we are giving up the dog. It took me 5 years to warm up to him and now he has to go away. Im going to miss him. When i get my own place, im getting a pet. Now i am going to be super lonely.

I have work at 9 am. I hate working early during the week because the morning managers are real bitches and always take their anger out on me. Boss lady Lynnette will be working.  I dont what to do to gain back her trust. It bothers me so much to where i can't stop thinking about it. It is consuming me. I want to text her but it wouldn't look right.  "

Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs been a weird week. And a weird day. Woke up to a bruised and swollen wrist. I decided to slam it against a screwdriver hammer last night. I‚Äôm such an idiot. The pain felt good in a way different than cutting ever did. It felt like real pain. It was dull but intense. My wrist was quite swollen last night, but it‚Äôs not so much now, it‚Äôs still slightly distorted, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go away.

Field trip was kinda fun. Sat near the front of the bus next to River and Raegan and Fink. We were separated into two groups to see different shows, I didn‚Äôt go in Finks group, but my group had the more responsible people. One thing I‚Äôve learned today: People who work in art museums are kind of big dignified cunts. They‚Äôre not mean, but can come off as subtly rude and snotty in my opinion. Note to self, never work at a museum in any important role.

Anyways, bus ride back was ok. I kinda felt a little drained after all that listening to uptight people talk for an hour, I was a little distant, but Fink tried to make conversation with River and Raegan and I, and I just can‚Äôt help but smile at everything he says. I mean, how can I not? Pretty much everything he says is funny or sweet, caring, or kind. There‚Äôs no end to his kindness.

We got back during lunch. I went to go get some food, and I sat in the hall. I went back to class a little early before class ended and decided to run some ink through my successful screen and it worked. I did it pretty quick too, by the time he  got back from lunch I was just finishing up washing off a scraper. A few mins later he asked if I wanted to try printing my screen and I showed him the print I had just made moments before. He thought it was cool. We agreed we should try something with higher detail. The rest of 7th hour was pretty average. I got really curious about different photographic methods and started to tentatively ask Fink about them. He said he was going to make a photo polymer print today anyways and I could watch. So I did. I just watched him in the changing room fail like 4 times and ruin a bunch of plates. It also smelled like horse shit with those chemicals from washing off the plates. I hope I didn‚Äôt give off a bored vibe. I really wasn‚Äôt, I was just kind of out of it.

I still have no clue what to do in art club anymore. It isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôve lost interest, just motivation and creativity. Margeaux and some kid with severe hyper active ADD came in with his cool one wheel electric skateboard thing. Fink asked questions about it and the kid gave a demo. He made it look pretty easy. The kid asked if we wanted to try and Fink seemed pretty eager to try. Fink has pretty damn good balance. Later he said I should give it a try. I was like what the heck sure, and hopped on. And damn it‚Äôs hard to balance. I can barely balance in my own two feet being 6‚Äô but on a wobbly one wheeled skateboard, I look like a pathetic newborn giraffe. Anyways, I was moving back and forth and it kept moving to the left no matter what I did and I lost control and fell backwards onto my ass flat on my back. It hurt pretty bad, but with bruises, they don‚Äôt usually hurt so bad right away. I picked myself up, and carried on.

I asked if he had a phone charger, I just plugged into his stereo. Played some music because I felt bad for unplugging his phone. 30 minutes of hyper active kid talking later, Oh, Sinnerman by Black Diamond Heavies was playing and Fink asked what band it was. I told him and I think he wrote it down!! Major coolness points scored today, except for my wipeout.

Oh and all fucking day long I held my right wrist with my left hand over the bruise painstakingly obviously, and not one glance or question except from Jeana.

I posted on my story about me bruising my tailbone. He replied and said he was so sorry for peer pressuring me into it. I said I was gonna sue jokingly and said it was fine. Eee, I hope he doesn‚Äôt feel bad. It was my fault.

I left, came home, made a sandwich, went to church, etc. Now here I am. Recording my pathetic life. I wish I were more honest with how absolutely twisted and self centered and manipulative I am. But I can‚Äôt bear to even write it down even to myself. I barely scratch the surface of how shitty I am. Anyways, my main goal tomorrow is for Fink to ask about the bruise on my arm. My secondary goal is to wake up early and draw a prettier design for a print and make that tomorrow, then I have an excuse to stay after school. And tomorrow is the super long magazine meeting. Great. Fuck you me. You‚Äôre a shitty manipulative self centered shit who just wants attention. Just fucking end your life already."

school been alright. im doing good in principles of management but in principles of marketing, im failing. those little quizzes that are 20 points are fucking me up. I can highlight keywords when i read and do good on the small quizzes but on the big ones, i fail hard. I don't know any ways to study.  I dont want to flunk one class because of the tests and quizzes. I have to find a way to study.


I thought my boss was done being mad at me but apparently she's not. I can feel it in her energy that she still has anger towards me for that one Saturday with the schedule incident. It hurts me that she doesn't consider me like her kids. It makes me depressed. I fucked up a good thing. All because of a coworker that's nosy and gossipy. Going to work been a challenge. Its hard trying to work without the boss giving you dirty looks. This is one of those moments where i want to quit or transfer to another store. Its like a bad breakup. "

Every day is just a series wins and loses. Things repeat and inch forward and yo-yo back. No wait, other way around, things just yo-yo forward and inch back. But I‚Äôm begging to inch back. Inching back to mom, to childhood, to creativity and less responsibility. And life keeps moving forward. It always will. I don‚Äôt know if I necessarily want it to though.
Every day is a new challenge and adventure, it gets a bit repetitive at times but so much happens in one day. I wake up. Brush my teeth, get dressed, put on some music and head to the bus. Wake up to Sinatra, fall asleep to dean Martin. It‚Äôs a loop. Everything is a cycle, even my music taste. I haven‚Äôt listened to Sinatra and enjoyed it since Rob. Each day repeats. Some day to day internal drama with myself and art or Fink or my family or church. Some new hurdle to get over each day. And it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs hard to have long term projects and goals when I‚Äôm trying to tackle these daily hurdles. But the fucked thing about me is that whenever those hurdles become easier and repetitive, I get bland and hate myself. Either way, I need to stop rambling. I need to shower.

‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòTwas a normal shitty Tuesday, same ole morning routine. My day doesn‚Äôt really start until lunch‚Äî which was fine. Ate an orange, briefly ran into Fink in the hall, ate my orange in the dark room with Jeana and river and the gang. Tried to tape Sterlob to the ceiling. Didn‚Äôt end up lasting long. Sat on my ass for half of 6th hour before Fink started talking to me about screen printing. I saw him talk to Price during lunch about the water hose for the power sprayer. He told me he talked to price, and we decided to coat a couple of screens. He helped me pour the emulsion into the coater because I spill it every time I try. I did the rest. The coat went on nice and smoothly for the first time. Turns it that rubber strip was making it too thick and weird. I coated two screens, left them to dry, fucked around a little and Fink asked me to come with him down to the custodian to get a key for the water thing outside. We got it to work, but the hose was fucked and wouldn‚Äôt work. We decided we‚Äôd bring hoses tomorrow and try again.

Got back in the room and I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to try exposing the screens 5 seconds more. I tried one and it worked slightly better but the emulsion still came apart. After that one. I decided to try 35 seconds rather 25. Used the sprayer attached to the sink in the dark room, and Shazam, it worked! FINALLY. I came out and was so happy, Fink seemed relieved more than excited. I don‚Äôt blame him, but I feel like he didn‚Äôt care that much. I dunno.

He seemed busy working on a lino-cut or something. So much for being a sad sack of shit. I was too happy that screen finally worked.
I left at 3:10 so I could get to work on time. Didn‚Äôt even say bye. Ugh.

I need to start on my power project. Should have started Sunday or at least Monday. Fink said my project idea was really good before I left. I denied it, but he seemed to like it, he even made sure I read the sticky note he left in my sketchbook yesterday.

I‚Äôm gonna at least take a photo tomorrow and start sketching. SHIT. We don‚Äôt have school Friday. Ughhh. I need to figure shit out now. I want to come up with a cool design for a screen before Thursday so I have an excuse to stay after school. BUT, I need to use his spray glue for my project. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh. Maybe I can do both???

I need time to think every day. This is my outlet.

Today sucked. Fink messaged me this morning about the screen printing issues. Later in zine club he said he was losing sleep over the issue. I think this thing is really troubling him. We just need a power washer hookup in the classroom and all our problems would be solved. I spent some time this morning watching videos. I came up with a list of all possible problems and emailed it to him in 7th hour.

I felt kind of numb all day. I want Fink to know what the fuck is wrong with me. I need someone REAL to know about my pain. I sound so weird. I‚Äôm so sick of talking and thinking about this. I‚Äôve been thinking about this since the school year started. Jeez. BUT I HAD MY FUCKING SHOT TODAY AND BLEW IT. To be fair he asked me if I was okay in front of all of zine club. He came over and asked if I was okay, I said yeah I‚Äôm fine, he asked if I was just tired or long day I just nodded gloomily and rushed out of the classroom. I didn‚Äôt even get to sit on the stairs and wait because dad was here already.

Auggie just talked about trans shit the whole time. I hate that that‚Äôs all who he is. Just a trans kid. Nothing more. It‚Äôs all he talks about and frankly is annoying. Zine club is just trans club now.

But I was actually sad. Wasn‚Äôt just faking it. Partly, but I really felt like shit.

I worked for 2 hours for alex. Took a walk down to the grocery store later on.

When I got home from school I just laid flat on my bed and cried. I want to do that now. I probably will when I‚Äôm done with this. Just turn the lights down low, play some purple pilgrims, and think. Because I don‚Äôt get enough time to think. Maybe that‚Äôs good, I tend to overthink, but I feel unprepared and anxious when I can‚Äôt have time to think and relax.

I just fucking deleted what I had written and now I‚Äôll do it all over again. Ugh.

I don‚Äôt know if I want to. I feel like I should though.

That dream fucked with me bad. I keep thinking she‚Äôs not dead. The word dead doesn‚Äôt mean anything anymore. She‚Äôs not coming back ever. EVER. I‚Äôll never see her again not even in the afterlife. She‚Äôs just a memory now.

Grandma asked if I wanted anything ordered. I discovered a cool deckle edge ripper I thought was super neat. I got two, one for me, and one for Fink because I thought he‚Äôd find it really cool and useful. Plus I just want to pay him back for all the work he‚Äôs done for me.

Alex asked me to cover her shift Monday 4-7. I don‚Äôt want to, but I will because I‚Äôm her friend. I‚Äôll probably call and ask if I can do 5-7 so I can still make it to zine club. I want to make a zine for once so I have something to show for myself. Something simple, about spring or something. I want to start on my drawing tomorrow too, but I‚Äôll need to take a reference photo of myself.

It rained tonight. It was beautiful. The air at work smelled of exhaust and fry grease. But the rain was wet and cool. I can‚Äôt wait for thunderstorms even though we don‚Äôt have a porch anymore which sucks.

It‚Äôs almost been a year since she died. Just a few more months. I can‚Äôt believe it.

I had a dream last night. A real screwed up one. We were with dad at grammie‚Äôs house for some reason. Things happen and I discover that mom is still alive. They faked her death. I could see mom. For the first time since she died she was alive and moving and I pushed her hug away. I was disgusted and mad.

I saw mom. It felt so real. She was alive again. Fast forward and Robert came to the door or something. I only saw him for a second.

But she was alive and she looked sorry, kind of. I miss her so much. I just woke up and it‚Äôs really hard to type and I can barely cry because I‚Äôm so tired.

Almost fell asleep. I couldn‚Äôt let another day fly by. I need to write. I need to remember.

All I am anymore is an annoyance. Maybe he‚Äôs lied to himself, but I know he‚Äôs thought it. I am an annoyance. A pain in his butt. I bother him every day about something or another. Every day I‚Äôve got some question or some comment or need something from him.

I feel like garbage.

I ruined the screen. Maybe it was because of the light but I don‚Äôt think that would do anything. What keeps going wrong? Maybe it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs probably my fault, of course it‚Äôs my fault. It‚Äôs always my fault. Nothing ever works. I was so mad at myself after it didn‚Äôt work again I wanted to cry. I almost did. I‚Äôm lucky I have such amazing friends.

I didn‚Äôt finish my research. I half-assed it to show I meant to do it. But I wrote like two pages on brainstorming for my piece. I wrote ‚ÄúI want to get hit by a bus‚Äù on the page after. I kind of hope he doesn‚Äôt see it even though I did when I wrote it. I crossed it out, but I think he can still read it. Even drew a little person in front of a bus. Just a stupid thing. A joke. It‚Äôs all a joke. I‚Äôm the joke. I‚Äôm the one to laugh at. A pathetic sack of sad shit who wishes she was dead.

Today I finally realized something I didn‚Äôt want to believe, something I didn‚Äôt think was true. He‚Äôs like my second father in a way. What I said before was a lie I wanted to believe. But today I wished I was his family. I wished I grew up with him as my father in some other life. He‚Äôs perfect. Absolutely in every way. No doubt about it. He‚Äôs got it all. And I‚Äôm in his way. I‚Äôm always in his way. But I want to be in his way because he‚Äôll notice me. I want to be noticed. I know he notices me. He does. I wish I could read his thoughts. Am I annoying to him? That‚Äôs all I wonder about. All I think about is going to class. And on the weekends, all I can think about is going to class. It‚Äôs all his class. Sometimes it‚Äôs not about him. I love my friends so much. They just happen to be in his class. The environment he‚Äôs created is perfect, of course.

And I just wish I‚Äôd be hit by a bus. And die.

Rest of the day was like any other Friday I‚Äôll never remember. It‚Äôs okay, we have to have days like that, but I hate em. After work I went on a walk with dad. I wanted to go alone to listen to music but I ended up walking with him and listening to a sermon in Matthew 1. Take that A, I finally ‚Äúread‚Äù my bible. Great. Now I‚Äôm doing it out of spite. Screw you A. I love you but not when you know my secrets.

R invited me over tomorrow but of course I work. Alex asked me to cover her Monday night. I don‚Äôt want to, but I should. I need the money but I don‚Äôt want to work.

I wanted to properly sulk today but didn‚Äôt get a real chance. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm crying to my reddit diary. This stupid little diary I feel compelled to write in daily. I don‚Äôt know if I do it because I want to remember my life, or if I need to write to sort my emotions. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit of both. Maybe my future self is reading this right now.

I hate you, but as I sit in my sunlit room I can help but be reminded of sunny, good times with you.

Today im mostly reminded of our earlier days. The phone calls, messages, the way we talked shit to each other, how you made my heart flutter.. now you make my stomach sink, everyday.

I now think that its very possible that you've already forgotten me, that you're entranced by her.

I hope she hurts you.

I missed uni today because of you, again.

I went home early yesterday with tears in my eyes because of you, again.

I hope karma comes for you, although I question if you even really did anything wrong by me.

I wonder if this is my karma.

I used to bleed for you

yesterday I bled because of you, again

you keep coming back, but you never do

you haunt me so much

your person, your ghost

yesterday marks the 1 month mark of you not being mine, I wanted to be okay by now, maybe if you had stopped haunting me I would have been.

guess you move fast huh

guess I was a phase

I wonder if you lied

early mornings remind me of you

rainy nights and trolley rides remind me of you

days with erratic extreme weather remind me of you

those have been plentiful as of late, how cruel

remember that day I didn't go to work? you know why I didn't right?

our phone call was too compelling, captivating

that day you talked me into travelling to bondi

it went from swelteringly hot to hailing ferociously

I always wondered if that meant something

train rides hurt now

remember how you used to watch me?

you wished you could have someone like me

I feel that now

and I now know that to you I was just a moment

short and fleeting

filled with ferocious hail

and next to her

I truly pale

I‚Äôve lost weight!  I stepped on the scale after not eating anything but a granola bar all day. 223.6 pounds. That‚Äôs almost 10 pounds less than when I started! I kind of noticed my double chin had been going away very slowly, it doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äúhang‚Äù anymore, if you could call it that. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs working. I feel so much better about myself! I took a picture and compared it to my old one after I cut my bangs. My face shape seems less round near the bottom. I‚Äôm worried that when I lose more weight, the upper part of my head will stay that wide and I‚Äôll look like a gnome or something. But for now, I feel prettier. I know 10 pounds is barely anything. But the fact that I can tell a difference is really something. If I can lose 3-4 pounds a week, I‚Äôll have lost 30 pounds by the time school ends. If I keep this up during the summer. I‚Äôll weigh 170 pounds when school starts. That‚Äôs 60 pounds less, and totally do-able. I refuse to call it anorexia because I have control over it unlike those with anorexia. I can stop any time.

I guess if I‚Äôm going to lose so much weight I should probably hold off on buying clothes until the school year starts again. Or at lest until I can‚Äôt fit in my jeans anymore.

I‚Äôm trying to ignore the rumbles of my stomach. I ate three granola bars, and a whole ass bag of skinny pop. That puts me at at LEAST 1,000 cals for the day. I can do better though. I want to buy some more oranges because they are SO filling and SO low calorie.

Anyways, enough with my weight loss crap. I‚Äôve got a field trip tomorrow. One I shouldn‚Äôt technically even be going on. It‚Äôs for Fink‚Äôs photo class. The week before spring break he was giving someone a field trip form I thought was for the one we had rescheduled and I asked for one. He handed me one and said it was for the photo field trip, but I could come if I really wanted. It was kind of a joke but I didn‚Äôt know if he was being serious or not. I asked him today if he was just joking or if he was serious and he said I could come. I‚Äôm so excited. I feel a little strange about going, like I don‚Äôt quite belong.

Either way, log and Jean will be there so at least I‚Äôll have some friends. I don‚Äôt know whether to bring my analog camera or ask Fink to let me borrow a digital one. I don‚Äôt really like analog, and I only have one roll of film. But on the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to be an annoyance and ask for a digital camera early in the morning.

I finished my VF class today. Now it‚Äôs officially my study hall and my teacher from hell had no excuse to complain when I‚Äôm not doing work. Thank god. We started the Great Gatsby in English today too.

I hope tomorrow isn‚Äôt a trainwreck. I feel like I‚Äôm back in October again, but this time things are more different. Ugh, I should stop being so pessimistic and have a great Wednesday tomorrow. I just hope the weather doesn‚Äôt suck.

I need to start on that art project. Actually, I need to start on two. I should do that tomorrow. "

Today I finally got all my stuff straightened out for my surgery.

Yesterday I was told it was going to be in April, then today I was told it was going to be in May lol. Also I was told I was going to be discharged the day of my surgery, then later I was told I was going to be in the hospital for 3 days.

All I gotta do is get my ride situation straightened out because I can't drive home, I need to recover.

I'm going to be on temporary 6 week disability and also call off work for those 6 weeks. All I need to do is drop by the gyn's office (call them ahead of time so they can get the letter ready for my workplace) and then submit it so HR can process it and know I'll be gone for a while for medical reasons.

My birthday will be a week after my surgery so I can't eat good that time haha. I wanted to celebrate with my coworkers because I never actually did celebrate with them, I was always going out of town.

Just thinking about it, it has been a very hard road. I went through a whole lot to get to this point. I'm glad things are finally at the point where they know what's going on and it's going to be dealt with. All I have to worry about is surgery and recovery.

For months I just didn't know what was going on with me and my old doctor just was so bad at helping me. And my problem isn't unique at all, women just tend to not get taken seriously. Women's health isn't taken that seriously because it's assumed that we exaggerate. I'm young, 28 years old, I can walk and talk normally, etc like your average healthy person. So because of that I was treated like I was exaggerating my pelvic issues... I'm extremely glad I changed to a new doctor and they have been so great at getting me help and examinations.

It was very hard to talk about just a couple of months ago. Now I can talk about it candidly and in a nonchalant manner, but it's still a pretty huge deal. I don't talk about this stuff looking for attention at all, I don't complain about my health unless I'm in a lot of pain. I talk about it so work knows my situation and also because people care and wonder how I'm doing. But yeah. This has dragged on long enough since I just wasn't sure if I was ready to get my ovary removed, but honestly I'm okay for now.

People still ask if I'm hurting and not really, the worst has passed since I managed it. The worst pain was my prolapse, which I fixed with exercise. And I've been more careful ever since to avoid getting to that point again. That prolapse lasted for months... so traumatizing to not know what was going on with me and to be treated like I was exaggerating it. That I solved it all by myself, thanks to the advice of another redditor actually. I'm thankful for their advice, it really helped me a lot.

Anyway, I'll see if I update again. I tend to use this account to talk about my health issues. Hopefully everything goes well in the end."

Today was good, today was great even.
Woke up and wanted to kill myself because I didn‚Äôt get things done. Maybe if I start finishing my homework in the evening I won‚Äôt wake up every morning wanting to die. Just a thought.

School was boring and normal as hell until lunch. Jake sat with us at lunch which was pretty odd. He‚Äôs kinda cute he just has such a different personality. We got our new art project assigned today. ‚ÄúArt & Power‚Äù the question asked was what do you feel like has power over you, or what do you feel like you have power over? As usual I had NO idea. But he mentioned something about college, and that sparked something in me that gave me ideas. I want to make a large Kymia Nawabi esque drawing about what I feel like my life should look like 10 years from now according to my family and church. Something along those lines, I have ideas, but they are purely visual and hard to write about. I want to get started sketching tomorrow.

I didn‚Äôt talk to Fink once during 6th or 7th hour, not even in club until the very end. I was kinda bummed, until he was about to shut down the darkroom and he asked me if I‚Äôve turned in my projects and got caught up with that. I got all nervous and stressed, and just honestly told him that I was switching out one of them for something I made a while back for fun, and that the other one I‚Äôd have done tonight and I‚Äôd send him a picture. Then we were about to leave the dark room and he‚Äôs like Oh BTW, you got picked for the PTA scholarship of 300$ and I was completely shocked. I didn‚Äôt know what to say at first. I felt like my reaction was pretty bland but I didn‚Äôt fully realize yet that I‚Äôd been given 300$. I didn‚Äôt even know he wrote them for me. He didn‚Äôt even tell me. It‚Äôs one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. Even f it‚Äôs not HIS money, he spent all that time and effort into writing something to the PTA to get me that $$$.

He‚Äôs literally the best person in the world. I left and sat down on the stairs outside and he waved as he drove by. I felt like I didn‚Äôt express my thanks to him enough, and I never will be able to fully, but I wrote him a message saying how thankful I was, and that it was just the amount I needed. But that‚Äôs the thing.. it WAS the amount I needed. Perfectly. Except I didn‚Äôt want to tell him my grandparents are paying for all but 300$ of the price. Especially after how much drama I made over never being able to pay for it. I feel bad, but I don‚Äôt for some strange reason. All I can say is that it‚Äôs a miracle. I basically was given a full ride to the camp between my grandparents and the PTA. Praise God.

After school my sister and I walked down to the grocery store and bought some low-cal food. Popcorn, granola bars, and two oranges. Because it‚Äôs orange season according to Fink. We sat outside on the curb peeling and eating our oranges. They were so filling and tasty and only like 70 calories. I should have bought more. Maybe later this week.

I‚Äôm so excited. But I feel a little overwhelmed right now. I just need a workspace. Then I can start being organized and have a plan. That‚Äôs my next money spending goal, to design a studio space that can fit into my room.

Anyways. I finished my night drawing and posted it to Instagram tonight. Fink liked it. He asked if I had ever done a night scene before. I was looking back over my timeline as a whole and I didn‚Äôt realize how many landscapes I make. I don‚Äôt like to say, ‚ÄúLandscapes are my thing‚Äù but the pictures don‚Äôt lie. I want to get away from landscapes for a bit and focus more on space, figure, texture, and color.


I feel organized in my messy little life, in my messy little room. I feel like I‚Äôm gaining control for once. I can have a mental breakdown later. Right now I just need to get shit done. "

the drama at work simmer down but im still out of my boss's circle. it still hurts but im numb to the pain.  my st.patrick day was okay. another plain day at work.

today i will be starting school. this is the first time going back to school since 2012 when i graduated high school. i hope i do well. im feeling excited about it. i know the excitement will last until i come across something thats fucked up. i discovered there are more websites that offer courses on the i.t support certificate. they are claiming that you can get your i.t certificate in 8 months. the lady on the phone when i registered for class did mentioned something about it being accelerated so i might get done sooner. with a certificate i can find an entry-level job in the i.t field. i also want to know if this is the career i want to do. i hope i didnt pick the wrong program.  either way i want something good out of all of this. only problem is i didnt tell my brother and sister in law. i don't know how they would feel about me going to college. even though its online. i just hope they would be ok with it. i been wanting to go back to school and this is my chance.

i have all these writing apps that i never take time for. i have twitter, evernote and journalbot that is sitting unused. im fucking up here. the writer block must be destroyed.

I‚Äôm so excited to go back to school, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying that after how much I wanted to just sleep in another week. Fink actually seems excited about the new quarter! I hope this ones gonna be a good one. I‚Äôm looking forward to new projects. He actually liked my crappy texture project which I can‚Äôt believe. But I don‚Äôt know what other people did for theirs.

He said, ‚ÄúHa ha!! It‚Äôs a cacophonous riot revolt of color. I love it! It‚Äôs like free form funkified punk jazz when you‚Äôre used to acoustic guitar and voice. Both are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs different but I like that you snuck your own quiet poetry in there. Beautiful.‚Äù

He‚Äôs so kind. And he uses my name too, which is something so seemingly insignificant but it really means a lot to me for some reason. I don‚Äôt know what my own quiet poetry is, maybe the stamp or my tiny textures. Who knows. But he likes even the shitty stuff I make. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so great.

My stepmom found my blades today. I don‚Äôt know if she realized what they were, but she was doing my laundry and they were in my pocket. Just three tiny pencil sharpener blades. She might not even realize what I use them for, but there‚Äôs a good chance she knows, she just doesn‚Äôt want to confront me about it. I cut out some words on paper using them. If anyone asks, my first excuse is that I couldn‚Äôt find an exacto knife to cut paper, and if they see through that, I‚Äôll tell them I cut myself on my arm. Which only has a handful of cuts. They can never know about my thighs. Ever. Even I can barely look at them.

I really need to draw but I don‚Äôt want to. I just want to sleep. I have to get that sky drawing done tonight, AND a whole new one. On top of that, I‚Äôll have to finish my research tomorrow. AND SHIT, I didn‚Äôt come up with any zines. I hate myself. I hope I don‚Äôt disappoint Fink too much.

My sister is in the hospital because she fell when roller skating and her glasses cut deep into her forehead, and she might have hurt her arm. They left over three hours ago and I haven‚Äôt heard much. Been watching the x-files since and decided I should probably go to bed even though I‚Äôm wide awake. I‚Äôve had this weird headache all day and part of yesterday which I believe to be due to a lack of sleep, or lack of a consistent sleep schedule. I don‚Äôt really wanna deal with a headache tomorrow, I have too many art projects I need to finish up. Leave it to me to leave it to the last day possible.

I worked a 10 hour day and don‚Äôt even feel like it. It‚Äôs amazing what a good shower and some tv can do. I went a bit over my calorie limit today. I need to stop. I need to have self control. I need to lose weight, not just for others, but for myself. If I lost weight, people would notice. Maybe Fink would. I wonder what he would say, if anything. If I lose a ton of weight before next school year, I‚Äôm sure to get some sort of comment from him. I don‚Äôt know why I care that he would care. I‚Äôm so weird. I guess I just want attention, praise, that‚Äôs all I ever want. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted from anyone, especially him. I don‚Äôt need praise from peers, never have. I just want praise from adults. He just happens to be one of the only adults I enjoy being around.

I‚Äôm pretty sick, but at least I can be honest with myself. I know what I want, I know what I need. I don‚Äôt like that, but it is what it is. I don‚Äôt mean to sound so nonchalant about my creepy obsessions, I‚Äôm just so used to me being a creep, I‚Äôve come to terms with it.

But is it really creepy? Am I truly a .. creep? Is being obsessed with your high school art teacher creepy? Not obsessed in a .. I want to murder, or I‚Äôm in love with, but am obsessed more like... I desperately need attention because I feel so lonely and the only attention I care about is his because a. he‚Äôs an adult male and apparently I have father issues. b. he actually cares about me and my art. c. HE‚Äôs an amazing artist, person, teacher, everything. He‚Äôs practically perfect in every way. Ugh. The way I word everything makes it sound creepy. Guess I‚Äôm just in a weird mood right now. I just wish he knew how much he has impacted my life and how much he means to me. That‚Äôs all I want, is for him to know I care back, that he deserves the utmost thanks.

I should go to bed, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll fall asleep. I‚Äôll probably wake up here in the next hour when they get home from the hospital. They‚Äôre glueing her forehead back together as I type.  "

I struggle with understanding why self-harm is so heavily frowned upon. I understand that it's not the most healthy coping mechanism but neither is drinking and plenty of people condone that.

Do I want my friends to self-harm? No. Why? I hope they're not in a dark place that would lead them to feelings that self-harm would potentially alleviate - even if just temporarily. Myself? I don't care if I do it. I don't think it's all that bad and I have a hard time convincing myself otherwise.

If someone understands the risk and does what they should to mitigate those risks why is it so bad?

Maybe I‚Äôve tricked myself into believing I need other people to be happy, to feel alive. Maybe that‚Äôs not the case anymore. I‚Äôve felt perfectly fine these last few days without people, I mean, except for my family. Countless times I‚Äôve written about school and how much I need it, how much it keeps me going and happy. But 80% of the time I end up crying as soon as I leave Fink‚Äôs room because of how stupid I am. Maybe it‚Äôs really not all that healthy for me. I don‚Äôt know.

It feels weird not feeling. I‚Äôm so used to a rollercoaster of emotions every single day. Today and yesterday and Tuesday and Wednesday were so.. plain. Nothing bad happened, and nothing overwhelmingly good. EXCEPT, my art camp is paid for. My grandparents gave me a card with a letter telling me they‚Äôd help pay for camp. The communication was bad on their part and I didn‚Äôt understand what they offered me until the car ride home from lunch. They‚Äôre paying for 2,300$. THATS a lot of fucking money. I‚Äôm going! It‚Äôs real! I need to slap myself because it feels like a dream. The excitement hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet and it‚Äôs been over 24 hours. I don‚Äôt know why. I think my emotions broke and I‚Äôve been feeling kinda blank all week.

Boom. It‚Äôs settled. So many hours of working so hard and worrying so much. It‚Äôs taken care of. Jeez.

I wanna buy nice clothes for the camp. I wanna be stylish. I really want some dr. Martens sandals and boots, and I reallllly want a pair of these top shop jeans. Maybe that‚Äôs too overboard? I need to learn to be content. I don‚Äôt like standing out, never have. I don‚Äôt know why all of the sudden I want to. If I wanna stand out at this camp, I‚Äôll wear normal clothes. I‚Äôll be a normal kid. But if I lose weight... these pants are so cute. They‚Äôre almost a 10 hour days worth of work, but they‚Äôre so cool. I wanna look cute, I wanna be pretty, I just need to lose weight. I went almost 350 calories over my limit today. I know it‚Äôs not a TON, but it‚Äôs more than I wanted to. I‚Äôm only eating two chicken sandwiches and two apple sauces tomorrow. That‚Äôs it. A nice, even, 880 calories. Maybe ONE egg for lunch.

I need to be patient. Now that I have 2,300$ I don‚Äôt need to worry about, I should really save it. Maybe for a car, maybe for college, or maybe for a new desk. I should really focus on having a nice space to create rather than buying 90$ jeans. I could pretty much buy the table top for that price. Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna go watch tv and drink water.

It's been a few months since my last post.

I had been waiting a long time to get approved for surgery. Turns out it was miscommunication or some weird thing going on between my insurance, my doctor, and gynecologist.

I'd call my insurance and they said that they closed my doctor's request to return to my gynecologist because they didn't state that I had seen my second opinion (which did nothing to ask for surgery) and the reason why I wanted to go back (which was to get surgery). That went on for about a month. One week of waiting for the second opinion, 2 weeks of waiting to go back to my gyn. I had finally just went to my doctor in person to get my authorization letter, which they printed out for me... so I waited 2 weeks for nothing. Turns out my gynecologist had also made a request for me to see them (I had also called them as well). And then another month of actually seeing my gyn in a new appointment. And now, another month of seeing my gyn again to probably tell me how to prepare for my surgery. The wait is always long...

I got my letter from my insurance telling me which hospital I'd be going to. I looked them up on yelp (yelp reviews are extremely helpful!) and the hospital I'm going to has a really low rating... that's really not a good sign, so I'm kind of wary but I have no choice. I hope they don't give me a hard time or make my stay terrible. Or worse... neglect me and I end up with worse complications.

Also my surgery, from what the gynecologist told me, is going to be like a C-section. So he's going to cut me open, take out my fibroid cyst (and any other cysts he sees if they popped up in the past few months), and also take out my ovary and the tube attached to it (because the ovary was replaced by a dermoid cyst, in this case it was referred to as a tumor).

I'm really hoping for the best. I am very worried about my recovery process, considering that I don't have the most caring people around me who can't be there to help me and can't be there 24/7. I've never had surgery, and that I have to take precautions to not have complications... It's overwhelming to have an ovary removed and go all through this stuff for sure.

I had been complaining about pain for the longest time and I am finally getting help at this point at last. It was a long and arduous road. I'm thankful I finally got a good doctor and that my doctor has good staff. They're really on top of things and are very nice. I wish I encountered more nice people in the healthcare industry like them more. My previous doctor and the staff were terribly rude and uncaring.

Anyway, I hope I can make it out of this 90% better at least. I'm getting closer... and I'm nervous. Deep breaths. Maybe when this is all over, I'll come back and talk about my experience."

so much has occurred. i couldn't get the words out so im gonna wing it like i always do.

i got my state and tax returns. i saved some of it but i ended up spending it. i bought a nintendo switch with pokemon let's go Pikachu. i was so happy and excited until my sister in law noticed and had a serious talk about how its silly and immature for a guy my age to drop $300 on a game console and that its half of the amount of a rent on a apartment. she told me to look up the cost of a 1 bedroom place and they ranged from $600-800. once she saw how shocked i was at the price, she told me that its not cheap to live on my own and that i need a full time job. i could use the full time job.

at work, somehow i got myself involved in another drama.  schedules came out and i had more hours than someone and when i asked my boss about giving up a day, she said no. later on she texted me saying she took a day away from me and i said okay whatever. another co-worker that i always talked to and good friends with told me someone i had seniority over had more hours. i come to work to talk to my boss about it and she told me that the co-worker i always talked to which i will now call maria needs to mind her own business. she say that because maria is known as the gossip queen and likes to know everyone's personal business and looks at people's schedules to see how many hours they got. my job is part of a union so each time someone below her in seniority has more hours than her, she would call the union and my boss would get so angry at her. maria also tend to be rude sometimes. my boss then told me i was gullible and that i always fall for her to problems and listens to her too much which is true. she told me before to stay away from maria but i didnt listen. my boss was saying how everyone at work noticed how tight me and maria are and think we are dating. maria is 57 and im 25. she is tooo old for me and plus im gay. i feel so embarrassed now. my phone kept going off with messages from maria and my boss took my  phone and read my messages from her. my boss who i will call Lynnette exploded and got really angry saying that she was sooo sick of maria and that she is done trying to persuade me from talking to her. she also told me she will no longer talk to me about things other than work and that im no longer her adopted son. she has a circle of people she is close to at work and i got kicked out of that circle.  i didnt explain the story well enough but just know that i lost my boss's trust and im no longer in that circle. it hurts inside because me and Lynnette always had a good working relationship and she is a mother figure to me.  i feel nothing but guilt eating at me. because of this i stopped texting maria. she keeps texting but im not gonna respond. i now realize maria is nothing but a problem. now im just gonna keep to myself.

the being gullible part is true. i fall for every little thing and i get the brunt of the result. people use me all the time and i never realized it until the damage is done. why do i have to be so fucking stupid? im a fucking idiot.

now i have no one to talk to and no dating app to use. im lonely and horny.  i feel so many emotions right now i don't know what to do. i wish i could scream but my voice is too weak. i just want to scream for once. i want the voice other people have.

I should be less worried about things and my plan for life. Everything has worked out so far, every trial, I‚Äôve survived and I‚Äôm in a better place because of it. And the things I hate about my dad, like how easy going he is, is actually his strength and something I lack. I need to be more ‚Äúchill.‚Äù I totally overthink something. Someone ends a statement with a period to me instead of an exclamation mark and I flip my shit. I get all mad at them, then myself, and one thing leads to another and in just ten minutes I‚Äôve already come to terms with never talking to them ever again, then I realize, what the heck me? Like this whole drama about the art camp. Ugh, I could have saved myself so much stress if I would have just trusted God. I know how ridiculous that sounds, but so much peace comes from trusting god instead of myself. At the end of the day, at the end of my emotional messes, at the end of my short lived fantasies,and unrealistic plans for my life, He‚Äôs been there. And I‚Äôve ignored him. Why did I turn my back on the truth, there is ONE truth, and I know that at the very core of my soul. I need to trust God, but right now it feels like the equivalent of me suddenly showing up at Audrey‚Äôs door and saying I want to be friends again, it just seems so absurd. Obviously I‚Äôve been lacking knowledge of the character of God, but jeez. I don‚Äôt regret anything honestly. I do, but I don‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now. I like the struggle. Sometimes sanctification scares me. I just wanna be a mess right now. My soul feeds off my emotional stresses and drama and it‚Äôs kind of gross. I don‚Äôt know. This all came back to me suddenly. I‚Äôm so impacted by the people I‚Äôm around. I guess this is what happens when I‚Äôve been at church so often lately.

Anyways, I‚Äôm kind of pissed of said church conference because I didn‚Äôt get the stuff I needed to get done tonight, but we wouldn‚Äôt have talked in the living room for hours if we didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs all the butterfly effect.

Laura is going to be home for the rest of the week instead of at work. I‚Äôm excited. I love her so much, it‚Äôs so nice to have a different personality besides dad. He‚Äôs just so.. unstressed, and it kind of makes me stressed knowing he‚Äôs not concerned with anything. I‚Äôm a mess.

Today I felt kind of pretty for a split second. After I got home from work and took my hair down. It kind of waved and my bangs were parted in the middle and flowed into my hair. I kind of wonder if I should grow them out. I‚Äôd look a lot older if I would. You know what? I‚Äôll do it! By the time camp rolls around they‚Äôll be at the perfect length. Sweet, now I‚Äôm losing weight, growing my nails out, AND my hair. Wow. I feel so much like an adult. Which I WILL be in a year and two months. AGH. THATS SO SOON. I‚Äôm not ready for life, but if I reflect back on how much I change in a year, I‚Äôll be fine.

Moral of today: I need to start trusting God more. My life is not my own. I am broken.

Break me Lord. You tried with mom over summer but even that couldn‚Äôt break my wall. I‚Äôm tired of fighting. I give up.

Amen."

Alrighty, time for another post. Her and I were intimate the other day for the first time in over half a year I'd say. So that's very exciting. I did have some issues this morning and yesterday morning as well with thinking about it too much and making some bad decisions (with some bad thoughts popping up and me continuing for a while). I still have some anxieties and stuff with bad thoughts or checking people out ect but I am trying to just not let them effect me and not worry about it so as to just let them pass and not get fixated on it. Like, I know I would never cheat on Her again. But I will have a bad thought of something like that, but I know I wouldn't. I couldn't hurt Her like that again, largely because I think the anxiety of it all would actually kill me. Then I wonder if I am correct though, like, if put in the situation where I could what would I do? I feel I wouldn't. More importantly, I am not going to do anything that would put me into a position where that is possible. I feel some anxiety now. I gotta relax and not think about things."

I didn‚Äôt realize how out of control my self harm was/is. Jeez. I started comparing my cuts to others and I realized I cut a lot more than most people who do, just not as deep as some. I wish I could do deep, but I‚Äôm too scared. I‚Äôd rather not.

The missionaries wife shared her testimony today. She struggled really badly with depression and self harm in her youth. Like really bad, and I want to talk to her, part of me does. But obviously I can‚Äôt. That isn‚Äôt an option. An anonymous email maybe, but even then, people would figure out by deduction it was me.

I freaked the hell out last night. My sister wrote my a note telling me she found my blades and threw them away, it was a sweet letter, but it put me into a mild panic attack. The guys on the discord server helped calm me down and think rationally, but man, I wanted to cut so bad. I really let her down. I‚Äôm a bad sister. I sure hope to god she never tells dad.

I look down and feel the hundreds of scars and cuts on my leg and just get sad. Why did I do this to myself? I know why, but WHY?

I want to bruise again. But I need a reason. It just doesn‚Äôt work without extreme self hatred. I need to screw up in front of Fink or something. That always does the trick. I feel like utter garbage when I do something not perfect around him. I feel like a stupid failure. I hate it when I can‚Äôt find the right words. I hate it when I don‚Äôt make enough art. I hate myself. I wish I could be like him, with wise words that flow freely, never saying the wrong thing. Words flow from him like a stream down a mountain. When we did the radio show, words just poured out straight from the flames of passion of his heart. He has so much passion for his craft and his work. And passion for caring for us students.

I want to make art he likes, not just art he appreciates, art he loves. I know how to do that. I just don‚Äôt know HOW, I mean, physically. I‚Äôm a bad photographer. While I LOVE his taste in alternative photography and printmaking and art in general, I just am bad at that type of thing. I am more precise in my work. That‚Äôs just how I roll. I just want to find a style of art that comes naturally that Fink likes, and that I can show to my family and friends without seeming dark and disturbing. Whatever. I‚Äôll figure it out.

Today I just realized how far in the year it is. ITS MARCH! I only have till December to create a bomb portfolio. Oh god. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Invited River over tomorrow to make cookies! That should be fun! She‚Äôs such a great person.

It feels so wrong not to be so overtly sad. I don‚Äôt like this numb life. It‚Äôs not numb, bad, but it‚Äôs not great, good. It‚Äôs like a taste in my mouth that doesn‚Äôt taste bad, but I wish would go away.  I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm trying to explain here other than that I wish that my emotions weren‚Äôt so plain. I feel like my father. Ew. He‚Äôs always so plain all the time. I don‚Äôt think he has the capacity to be excited or sad, or even mad anymore. That‚Äôs a nice thing, but it also sucks not having someone to be excited for your accomplishments. I don‚Äôt know how my sister can vent to him all the time. I mean, he provides some pretty solid solutions, but they aren‚Äôt always the solutions I WANT to hear. Guess that means I‚Äôm just a self-centered little cunt or something. I need to stop talking about him. I literally don‚Äôt care about him. Why do I care so much. He‚Äôs just kind of there. At least he‚Äôs reliable, I have that much at least.

I found a pretty sweet self-harm discord server last night. God, I wish I‚Äôd had that last year. Everyone seems really nice and supportive. But I don‚Äôt want supportive sometimes. Life sucks, people suck, we just gotta come to terms with that. I just spent some time telling a guy to not hate himself for not doing a good enough job calming his friend down. Then I proceeded to get mad at myself for not doing good enough to calm him down. I guess we can only control our own emotions. I‚Äôm glad I got off discord. Probably one of the better decisions I‚Äôve made. I don‚Äôt necessary regret anything (except HIM), because it‚Äôs made me a more laid back, and tougher individual. But man, I wish I‚Äôd spent more time connecting with.. I dunno.. people I see in a daily basis. Sometimes I think about HIM and I wonder what happened. Where did I go wrong to do what I did? I won‚Äôt even talk about what happened even to myself. I don‚Äôt want to even think about it. I hate myself for caring. Frank Sinatra still makes me think of him, but even more, that time I was sitting outside of the movie theatre because mom bought the wrong tickets to go see my favorite movie. ‚ÄúMy way‚Äù was playing in the theatre I was sitting outside of for some Kingsman trailer or something, and boy oh boy, that hit me hard. It was like I was an ice cream cone and I got dipped upside down into a chocolate bucket of intense emotions.

God, I really did used to hate her so much. I feel like a traitor to my former self for romanticizing my relationship with mom. She was kind of a shitty mom at times. Actually, for most of the time. It wasn‚Äôt until the last year or so of her life I started tolerating her, and even, dare I say, loving her. And it hurts so much.

...

Just listened to ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù for old times sake. Really regretting that. Suddenly I was a freshman again, it was spring. I was sleeping at moms alone for some reason. It was raining out, the orange glow of the streetlight poured through the blinds. I‚Äôm sitting on my sisters bed because she has the better bed with the blankets. I can see the whole room around me. It‚Äôs like a photo. I‚Äôm texting the guys or rob or someone on discord. Then suddenly I‚Äôm at the movie theatre. I‚Äôm holding my knees close to my chest as I watch from the floor as mom tries to get more tickets to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2. ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù is blaring from the open doors to the theatre. I want to die. [https://prnt.sc/mw4304](https://prnt.sc/mw4304) I forgot about this photo. This was it. That time in the theatre. I don‚Äôt feel any emotion looking at it anymore for some reason. I just feel kind of numb again.

I miss her so much. I miss that part of my life that died. It was kinda shitty, but it was MINE. I just want her phone. I know this sounds awful, but I hope grandad or Grammy keels over and leaves me moms ashes and phone and her shit. I just want moms photos. Is that too much to ask? I want her audio recordings and videos because I can‚Äôt hear her voice anymore. It‚Äôs gone. She‚Äôs gone. She fades from my life and I don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs gone. She‚Äôs so lost and so am I. I feel like I‚Äôm fishing for memories that won‚Äôt stick. Nothing does. Nothing is fair. I miss her more than anyone or anything. AND NO ONE KNOWS. Even my sister knows about my self harm, BUT NOT A SOUL KNOWS ABOUT HOW MUCH I MISS MOM. NO ONE AT SCHOOL KNOWS SHE DIED OVER THE SUMMER AND NO ONE CARES. But why should they? They didn‚Äôt know her. No one fucking did. I‚Äôm the only person on earth who KNEW my mom. Her parents might have raised her, but she was a different person as my mother. I died with her. Half of ME is gone. Genetically, and just my daily life. No more outings, weird adventures, exploring, nothing. No more lunches with the grandparents while we awkwardly sit in their expensive mansion. No more Louie, no more birds, no more anything, nothing at all. It‚Äôs all gone.

And the worst part about all of this is. I don‚Äôt have a grave to dramatically cry over. I DONT EVEN HAVE HER ASHES. WHAT THE HELL??? SHE WAS MY MOM MORE THAN SHE WAS YOUR DAUGHTER. SHE PROBABLY SITS IN SOME VASE SOMEWHERE. BUT I WONDER, DO YOU KEEP HER ON YOUR FIREPLACE, NEXT TO SOME ANCIENT CHINESE VASE ON TOP OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MARBLE? OR DO YOU HIDR HER AWAY IN YOUR BASEMENT ALONG WITH ALL THE SHIT IVE MADE YOU OVER THE YEARS. CAN YOU NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT HER? ALL YOUR MONEY AND YOU COULDN‚ÄôT EVEN BURY HER. I HATE YOU GUYS. FUCK YOU. GIVE ME MOMS STUFF. I WANT HER PHONE. I DESERVE THAT. I WANT TO SEE LOUIE, I NEVER LIKED THAT DOG BUT FUCK, ITS ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HER. THAT DOG WAS ONE OF HER ONLY JOYS IN THIS WORLD AND ILL BE DAMNED IF YOU PUT HIM IN SOME POUND. WHAT ABOUT MY BIRDS. YEAH, MY BIRDS. DID HE KILL THEM YET? OR DID HE GET RID OF THEM. I WANT TO SEE MY BIRDS.

ALSO MOST FUCKING IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW SHE DIED. WHY?????? Why? Why? What was her cause of death? Because saying she died in her sleep means a lot of things. I DESERVE TO KNOW. I HATE BOTTLING UP THIS SHIT. I MISS HER SO BAD. FUCK YOU DAD FOR NOT CARING.

Now I just wanna die. But if I die her memories die. I want to cut myself open. I need HELP. FROM A REAL ADULT HUMAN WHO CARES. I NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP FROM SOMEONE WHO WONT TELL MY DAD. I am entitled to my emotions and they are VALID. You HEAR THAT DAD? My. Emotions. ARE. VALID!

I gotta stop ranting like a pathetic psycho. Oh god, I can‚Äôt be psychotic. But hey, if I were, at least that‚Äôs one more thing mom and I have in common."

Alright, time for a post that is just reviewing the past few days. Today was a stressful day and yesterday wasn't my best. I felt a lot of frustration that lead to bad thoughts and decisions last night and today about the lack of any sexual relationship that Her and I currently have. Idk what a sexual relationship means to me. Do I feel that it helps me build a special bond with a person?  I think so? But I could not feel that bond/connection if I wanted? Idk. I felt anxious about a coworker and edged last night to Her and felt stressed and stuff and still feel anxious today. There is a TedTalk I watched the other day that I feel like I might show Her, but I don't want to cause any issues between Her and I though and I worry it might bother Her or something. Alright, that's all for now. I need to brush my teeth and get ready for bed."

I‚Äôve come to terms with expecting a normal life. I think most people have in a way. Normal for me means a steady job that isn‚Äôt physically exhausting, being able to make and sell my art on the side, and an apartment that isn‚Äôt falling apart. That‚Äôs all I need in life to be happy. A family would be nice too, but isn‚Äôt necessary. I can accomplish this without being a high school art prodigy. However, I desperately want to go to college, and the only way I‚Äôll make it is if I get good scholarships. I need to build my brand now. Become a recognized name amongst the local art scene. Then I‚Äôm sure to get great scholarships.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this because it sounds so pretentious, and I already know this stuff by heart, but I need to remember that things will be okay. I‚Äôve always adapted to change and tragedy.

I can make it.

I just can‚Äôt help but feel guilty when I sit around all day. I know that I need to set aside days to do that without feeling guilty, but I just can‚Äôt shake the guilt.

Whatever. I‚Äôm exhausted, just worked for 10 hours on my feet. All I know is that I need a job where I‚Äôm not on my feet all day when I‚Äôm out of college.... if I go to college. "

I don‚Äôt know what to feel. I saw the notification and smiled and smiled but I feel so much guilt. I feel guilty about not being excited about going. I‚Äôm so used to pushing my hopes down low so I won‚Äôt be disappointed. I don‚Äôt even know what expectations are real anymore. I need to figure out a payment system with dad real quick or else things could get messy. I need this camp. It‚Äôll get me into college easier. It‚Äôll set me up for my future.

But I can‚Äôt help thinking, what if the teachers are shitty? What if my roommate is annoying? What if I don‚Äôt learn a single new thing? What if dad won‚Äôt let me go when he finds out there might be nude figure models? What if he won‚Äôt let me go because Milla can‚Äôt? What if I get sick? What if I can‚Äôt draw good? What if I‚Äôm not the best?

I hate myself. Why am I so anxious and paranoid? Why can‚Äôt I be a happier person? Why can‚Äôt I just be cool for once? Why am I so high maintenance? I feel the hundreds of scars beneath my pants and I wonder why I stopped. Was it boredom, or have I gotten better? All of my friends are so open about their issues and share their accomplishments with the world every day. And I‚Äôm proud of them, and I never think of them wrongly when they do. Yet whenever I put myself out there, I feel as though I‚Äôm wasting peoples time. I wish I‚Äôd learn to take a compliment. I‚Äôm trying, but it feels so unnatural.

Tomorrow I work a day of my life away. Every Saturday. Every week. Down the drain for money. Money I‚Äôve spent because I couldn‚Äôt learn contentment. But I won‚Äôt complain. I‚Äôm lucky to have my job. It‚Äôs definitely not the best possible one, but it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve known.

A shift in my life is approaching and I don‚Äôt know what it will be or how it will play out. I‚Äôve had these senses before. The last time was 6 months before mom died. I knew I‚Äôd lose someone important to me that year and I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I knew it the second I got back in the car that day. I‚Äôve got some sort of super intuition.

Things are going to change. Soon, but not too soon. I‚Äôm going to realize something about myself or life that will change everything. I can feel it. My life is some sick system of cycles inside of bigger cycles that move at different speeds and at different sizes. Everything repeats itself. We are just too blind to see. I need to track it. I need concrete proof for myself.

Things haven‚Äôt felt real lately. I feel like I‚Äôm floating through time or I‚Äôve drifted into some alternate state. I don‚Äôt feel at home in my room, I never know what day it is. The idea of work sickens me. The uncertainty of the future scares me more than anything. School felt like school today, a feeling I haven‚Äôt felt in months, even a year.

I need Fink, he takes my mind of the numbness of life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worth it.‚Äù He said. How can I be worth it? I‚Äôm worth nothing, I‚Äôm not even good enough to get even a partial scholarship to a stupid high school art camp. What does that say about me now? Am I really worth it? Or is it because I‚Äôm a kiss-ass who is obsessed with his praise and approval? Would he think the same of me if he realized how much I think of him? He‚Äôs the father figure I‚Äôve always needed. My own has left me alone with years of bottled emotions and feelings. I‚Äôm beginning to understand what mom went through. If dad knew what went on in my head he would treat me like her.

Fink doesn‚Äôt do that to me. He‚Äôs the one adult in my life who sees people from the heart instead of clouded judgement like my father. He understands empathy, the most important thing a person can have. It helps we agree on most everything when it comes to art, and he shares that same passion for it I do. He‚Äôs just had more time to make it. But he CARES. More than anyone I‚Äôve ever seen. And it‚Äôs genuine. There aren‚Äôt a lot of genuines in my life. I want to make him proud with who I am and what I create because he understands in a way my dad doesn‚Äôt.

I still think about the day I cried on the bus when we passed where we used to live and where I found out mom died. He noticed something was up and when I got back to class to grab my bags he caught me in the hallway before I left. He asked me what was wrong and I couldn‚Äôt tell him the full truth. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to tell him. I just said it was hard going by there and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù a hundred times like an idiot. And then he hugged me. And it was the first time I‚Äôd felt safe and understood since mom died. He will never know how much I needed that hug. He will never know how much he means to me and I hate myself for not expressing my gratitude enough.

He saved me. I had hit rock bottom by December. My self harm was at its worst. And it wasn‚Äôt until school started again and I had two whole classes with him that I started becoming happy again. Things are going good overall. Obviously I‚Äôm still a mess but I‚Äôve always been a mess. It‚Äôs just been a pretty big mess this week that‚Äôs all.

I don‚Äôt want to think about mom or Fink right now. I kind of got off on a tangent again. I seem to have a problem with that. I just gotta make it to Sunday. Then I can relax for a few days. "

0,"He'll never call me beautiful and have it be the truth
I thought I'd never be happy. When I was 8 years old, my (f) cousins sexually abused me, and I thought that after that no man would ever want me. I used to cry myself to sleep at night mentally telling myself I should just be happy with whomever I got, and that I'd be lucky to be of sexual service to a man, because I'd never be anyone's first choice. I even started self harming in a most intimate way. I would carve harsh sawtooth like ridges into jumbo crayons and use those to masturbate with until my hand was covered in blood. I fantasized about how whoever my husband eventually was, he wouldn't want me. He'd tolerate me, at best.

&#x200B;

Twenty years later, nearly thirty years old now, my fantasies from childhood have come true. I spent a long time just dating whoever was interested in me- beggars cant be choosers after all, and I am very ugly and fat. I made a rule that I would never break up with a man, because if I did that over something stupid then I would just be ungrateful. Through much of my life I've followed that rule. I just made myself be happy with whoever I was with... the last relationship, lasting 8 years, devolving into a complete dead bedroom after 3 of those years. Despite me wearing lingerie and sometimes outright begging. Still, that isn't the issue that brings me here today. That has had years for me to become numb to it.

&#x200B;

As if through some miracle, someone who thought a lot like me, liked the same kind of games that I did, and had the same weird metaphysical interests as me became a very close friend. They told me everything, insisting I knew them better than anyone other than perhaps their own mother. Eventually while drunk one night, this man confessed that he loved me. He had never done anything sexual with anyone, and being a 'late bloomer' he had thought he would just have to pay someone for whatever intimacy he eventually had. He told me ""at least if it was with you it'd be someone I loved"".

&#x200B;

I felt as though... nobody had ever loved me this much. The closer we got the more I started to fall for him too. Soon we were voice chatting, and eventually we were sharing pics. I thought he was handsome and he thought I was, well... cute.

&#x200B;

Things were going well so well that we decided to meet up for real. We did, and we spent two nights together in a hotel. Those first two nights were so awkward... the farthest we got was hugging. I was alright with that, I didn't want to push things with him. When we talked after meeting up, he explained that although he loved everything about who I was as a person... he didn't like how I looked. He wanted to be with me despite that, and I resolved to try and improve myself. After all, I had really let myself go, and I knew 310lbs wasn't healthy.

&#x200B;

Some months passed and through intermittent fasting I lost 80lbs, landing me at 230lbs. I was much smaller than before, and I even got surgery to remove the excess skin that remained from how big my stomach had previously been. I was so excited, I weighed less than I did at the end of high school, less than I had my entire adult life. I felt great about myself, and I was content to stay at that weight for a while.

&#x200B;

We met up again. I paid for a lovely hotel. 9 Nights in his hometown in a suite I couldn't believe I could afford. The very first night he told me, although he was really proud of my for my efforts and I looked far, far better than the last time he saw me... He still liked girls that were thinner than that. I'd have to be thinner for him to want to initiate anything sexual. I asked him if I could suck his dick, something I figured looks wouldn't matter for, and despite having never experienced that before he still said no. Those 9 nights, sleeping together, and the most that happened were a few small peck-style kisses and some cuddling on the couch- which I still appreciated tremendously, and they are some of my most treasured memories.

&#x200B;

Time goes on. I'm having trouble continuing to lose weight. My willpower fails me.

It's been over a year since we became romantically serious about each other, and still he finds me no more attractive. To me, he is everything- seeing him is unreal, like seeing a celebrity in real life. We often have conflicts about his attraction. Sometimes he reassures me and says he's sure that eventually when we live together he'd feel comfortable enough with me to try out sexual things.

Tonight, though...

&#x200B;

He told me about a dream he'd had, a dream in which some very odd sexual stuff happened. He wasn't upset about the dream though, rather he found it entertaining. Stupidly, I internalized this and felt bad. I said I didn't understand how he could subconsciously tolerate such gross stuff in his dreams, but I was across the line of 'too gross'. I told him that I was able to leave my kinks behind and focus on just enjoying the partners I had in my physical life, and that I didn't understand why he couldn't. He said I was just repressing myself, and that he had no choice what he was attracted to, whereas for me being fat... it wasn't like I didn't have a choice. I told him all I'd ever had was negative reinforcement- being told I was too heavy, too ugly, too fat, too gross, smelled bad (despite showering regularly) and other stuff, and that it hurt to know that I was so gross to him that I'd never hear him tell me I was pretty, beautiful, or god forbid... sexy... without knowing instantly that it was a lie. I thought it was unfair as I often tell him how handsome and attractive I find him, and everything about him.

&#x200B;

There is no resolution to this story.

While I could easily find someone who is willing to butter me up with compliments, or provide me with sexual relief, I have never found someone willing to do those things who also meshes well with me mentally. Someone who wouldn't think I am crazy because I believe in things even more far fetched than a typical religious backstory. Someone I could feel comfortable telling anything to.

&#x200B;

I keep insisting to myself that it's better to be mentally satisfied with a partner than sexually, as my health is bad and even now although I am not very old I am rarely in a good enough condition to be having sex or even masturbating. Still, it all keeps coming back to how 8 year old me was right. No matter who I am with... they arent going to value me sexually. And if they do... they wont value me other ways. It just kills me because what does truly get him off, I can't ever be in real life. Even if I lose all my fat completely, I'll be saggy from having been fat before, and I'll be scarred from my multiple surgeries. And I can't ever be an anthro animal or dragon or whatever flavor of furry creature he's into. He even finds me so ugly that when I've asked if he'd like to see me wearing ears or a tail or even a fursuit he just cringes.

&#x200B;

I'll never be what he wants, and I'll never be beautiful to him. I deserve it all, because I am too fat.

I'll be going back to having 3-5 meals per week to try and lose more weight. The hunger I feel can just be additional punishment for daring to be ugly. "
0,"Scars from a rash
At the age of 22, I was still living with my parents.  My cousin came over with her sister to visit my mother.  I don't know these cousins personally but I do know this cousin is about 20 years older than myself.  On this particular day she visited, she decided to say something to me which she never has in the past.  She said, all while smiling, ""You had a bad diaper rash when you were a baby"".  I didn't know what to think or say.  Why would the first thing she has to say to me be something so negative?  And why did she have the opportunity to look down there?  And why was she smiling?  This wasn't funny.  I know how my mother would laugh at things like this so it led me to believe maybe they were making joking about it.  This was very mean and disrespectful.  So, she remembered about 21 years and 2 months ago that my mother stripped my diaper off for her to look at my privates and rash?  Why?  This made me very angry.

When I was around 10 months, my mother decided to bathe me with neutrogena soap.  She had to know this would be too strong for a baby.  She had three girls before I was born.  Well, this soap caused a bad chemical soap burn in my bikini area and it left large scars which I still have today.  Some parts of the scar looks like I was a burned victim because the skin overlaps and looks just like a burned victims skin.  I couldn't take care of myself.  She caused the rash which resulted in scars.  I was never taken to a dermatologist to find out how the scars could be removed.  She just left them there.

My mother has always loved to make you feel embarrassed because you're naked and she had to know I was even more embarrassed because of the scars she left on me.  When I was 7, I noticed her staring at me and didn't know why.  She told my father, ""give her a bath""...then my sister said, ""she doesn't want him to give her a bath""...I couldn't say I didn't want him to bathe me because I wouldn't been beaten and forced to let him anyway.  After he bathed me, he asked my mother about the scars.  I was so humiliated.  First a man bathing me at 7 and him seeing the scars.  He never bathed me before.  She just wanted me to be humiliated.

My mother has been known to strip a baby's diaper off many times before to show visitors things.  She used to have a home daycare and she kept mentioning one of the baby boy's had a small penis.  So, when my aunt came over to visit, she stripped his diaper off and they were laughing at it.  Afterwards, she made my sister put a diaper back on the baby.

Dear diary,

Why do I have such a hard time accepting my self worth? I work three jobs and I'm in grad school full time for a degree in social work. I work so hard, but I don't think I deserve anything. How am I in a field that puts so much emphasis on self care and mental health when I am struggling so much? I feel like I don't deserve any praise or any positive attention from my peers, professors, supervisors, etc. because I'm afraid it's all out of pity. All signs (grades, conversations, self assessments) point to me being successful, but I can't accept it.

You know when you see someone presenting in front of a group and they're just so nervous that their voice is shaking and they say ""um"" after every word and overall their presentation is HORRIBLE, but you can see how much effort it is for them to just stand up there in front of a crowd so you tell them how great they did? I fear that any time I receive a compliment, it's like that. Realistically, in my mind I know that it's not the case, but there's always a voice in my head telling me that I'm a piece of shit and any attention I get is out of pity.

I don't know how to change that.

Now I‚Äôve really done it. I didn‚Äôt even get to tell him I changed my mind and decided not to give up. I hate myself. A whole 11 days without seeing or hearing from him. I sound like a desperate creep, I‚Äôm just so dependent on his approval, I don‚Äôt know who or what I am without it. IM SUCH AN IDIOT!

I should have told him about last night. I feel like I‚Äôve failed him. Winter break was bad enough, but spring break is gonna be hell. I don‚Äôt know how to convince dad. Gotta gage what kind of mood he‚Äôs in first. I really wanna bruise myself, but I like cutting, I only bruise so that he might ask.

Alright, the past few days have been rough. I think it was Monday morning I edged to Her and again this morning too. IDK what to do. I want Her so bad but my actions just like that I feel just make Her want me less. I also tried talking to Her yesterday via text and She only gave me super short responses and I am not sure why. I want things to work between us still and I think they can. I just need to focus on the positives I think. I stayed up late working on a presentation I have to give in a few hours because my procrastination paralysis wouldn't let me actually start working on it until like 12:40. Stupid me. It feels so simple to just start my work or relapse or whatever but it feels difficult. I feel like it shouldn't be this hard. I talked to my brother about the work thing last night and he said I could go get free counseling at university if I wanted to. I might just have to try that. I missed Her yesterday and I told Her I just wanted to watch GOT and cuddle and I also asked Her if She saw the new trailer and She just replied ""Yea"". Kind of a bummer. I know it's hard for Her to be with me, I get it. But it doesn't stop me from feeling frustrated at times, not that I feel frustrated now per say. I feel understanding, mostly, at the moment. In good news it's Wednesday which means the school week is almost over. I just have to get through my presentation and then finish an assignment before midnight and then I can finally take the smallest of breaks. I do need to get work done this weekend though because the semester is really kicking up for the last half. Alright, that's all for now. I need to eat and start practicing."

0,"The Universe: SLOW DOWN
The message. Whatever mantra or affirmation That the universe has chose for me is (in my slow motion voice) SLOWWW DOWNNN.

So the night of the shrooms. I remember speaking to my baby and staring into his eyes and feeling his soft face and silky hair. Smelling him. Feeling him. Staring at him. All of it was so detailed and brand new. He asked me such profound questions. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the boss of this family?‚Äù He gave me such good advice. He understood me. He loved me.


In that moment I realized that just as I have an internal monologue, he has one too. I put myself in his shoes, i realized in so many ways he is just like me. Nervous and detailed. Charismatic and dramatic. Sensitive and emotional. He is his own human being self. But he is so much me and my experiences. He is his siblings‚Äô tendencies and friendships. He came into this world a pliable baby chunk of dough, and he has been molded and seasoned by all of his people and experiences. He has his own life. He is so lovely. A true personified spirit angel.


I asked myself why I had never realized this. Why it took me trying psychedelics to realize what is so obviously and clearly always in front of me. I felt such gratitude for him. I felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve anything so pure. I thought on the times I was so caught up in my own human selfish feelings and moments that I forgot to sympathize with his. I felt clarity. I felt love. I felt guilt. I kissed him as he slept. Begged for quiet forgiveness for anytime he felt pain in this world, and prayed to the universe my gratitude.

The message I received that night was simple.

SLOW DOWN.


I tested it. I thought of moments of anxiety and tension and sadness that i had experienced recently. Could my so called problem in these situations be solved by implementing this command.? Slow down. Slow it down. Gooo slow. I remember my epiphany being so amazing that i pulled up my notes app and wrote - the message is to slow down. I wanted to make sure I remembered it.


Since that moment, I have not been perfect. My old habits and foggy moments still rule me on autopilot. My kids still stress me, worry me, love me. My mind has been fast and nervous and dramatic. But every so often it pops up in my head. *slow down*. So I do. And I become fully present and see the world in Clarity. And it is amazing. These precious moments of mindfulness are small and far between. But they are happening more and more. It is a habit I have intentionally cultivated. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.


Never forget this. "

I love how every day of my life is just one mood-swinging rollercoaster anymore. The sale went well today. Made 33$. That‚Äôs a total of about 50$ so far. Which I‚Äôm honestly surprised about.

I stressed about writing a grant and came up with an outline and later found out that it‚Äôs pointless to write one to the PTA for something like this. That ruined me. I came to terms with not being able to go to the camp that hour, and I cried it out and was just really depressed the rest of class.

I went to the bathroom right before the bell because I had to cry and shit like a pathetic loser, and I came back to grab my bag and on the way Milla said that Fink wanted to talk to me, and I was like, what?? So I went in sheepishly and he was like Oh Syd, I need to talk to you. I shrugged and continued to be sad. I technically should have been in the basement taking my math test but screw that. I‚Äôm already failing anyways.

He told me to walk with him because he had a meeting to go to. And HOLY COW. This man is the nicest and most caring person I have ever met (but I already knew that anyways.) He genuinely cares about ME. Stupid old me who really isn‚Äôt that great of an artist anyways but is obsessed with pleasing him. He said that there is another school fund that might be available to help. I was a little sheepish when I found out I‚Äôd have to directly talk to someone in person. I‚Äôm pretty bad at that and he knows it. I thanked him, and went down to sit by the painting room waiting for dad. Logan came around the corner and we started talking and I opened up about the whole camp situation. He was sick yesterday so had no clue. I cried and whines like a sad little artsy bitch. I hate myself sometimes. But he‚Äôs so understanding! I love him aaaa.

I was SO SCARED to talk to dad about any of this. I just didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd know how. But tonight was a miracle. Anyways, when I got home, I had already come to the decision I wouldn‚Äôt go to the camp. I was disappointed but life would continue. I wrote a long text to Fink explaining that there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm gonna be able to go, and that I really appreciate how much he‚Äôs trying to help me. He wrote me back while I was at work saying that he wants me to make smart decisions and stuff and that he wants to do everything in his power to help. I am so thankful for him. I don‚Äôt know where I would be without all that he‚Äôs done for me.

I decided then I‚Äôd try to go still. I‚Äôll do everything in my power. We went to IKEA after I got off work. Dad was in a good mood, we all were. It was a miracle. IKEA always does that to him for some odd reason. Anyways, we got home and I hung around in the basement waiting for my opportunity to talk about the camp and my situation. IT WENT SURPRISINGLY WELL! He doesn‚Äôt seem absolutely opposed to it like before! Maybe it‚Äôs because I gave him a lot more info or something, or maybe it was the IKEA frozen yogurt in his stomach. Regardless, things look brighter for sure. I need to decide ASAP. I want to pay the 300$ deposit by Friday or sooner.

My stupid reddit diary entries sound so fake. I kind of wish I‚Äôd just spit out everything that came to my mind, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs for the best long term. I just think that every day is important, no matter how great or bad. And there are thousands and thousands of days in my past I have absolutely no recollection of that I wish I could remember. "

Some thoughts;

I‚Äôm still the same old sack of shit.
After all my drama this morning, things worked out fine like they always do on Mondays. Why did I doubt myself or anyone else? The sale went better than expected, class was alright, zine club was great. Yet I‚Äôm lying on my bed like a lump of fat with 27 bleeding cuts on my left thigh.

I called the CE office and found out that even if I do smaller payments, it‚Äôs still gotta be in my June 1st. Now I‚Äôm really screwed. Working overtime is not an option, and I‚Äôm deathly scared to tell dad I didn‚Äôt get the scholarship. He won‚Äôt ever understand how much this means to me.

Fink suggested writing a grant proposal to the PTA. Apparently they don‚Äôt often get grant requests from students, so I‚Äôm hoping I have some chances. I don‚Äôt want to write something TOO pretentious, but I really need that money. The last thing I want to do is get my hopes up. Because the second I do, according to Murphy‚Äôs law, that grant goes straight to the trash.

Not going to this camp or college seems really appealing to me right now. But this is my only path to success. But who needs success anyways? My dream life is living in some trailer park where the winters aren‚Äôt 2 degrees, and where I can live in peace and draw for the rest of my days.

Anyways, today was alright, as far as days of the week go. I wish this whole camp thing wasn‚Äôt looming over me. I need to talk to dad ASAP. But I want to write a rough draft for my grant proposal before Fink leaves for his conference or whatever.

I‚Äôm so glad he asked me what was wrong.

Wish he would have done that 4 months ago."

Too much of a good thing has left me numb and melancholic. I feel absolutely worthless and dumb. I bother him so much. All the time, I‚Äôm like a never ceasing crying child that won‚Äôt shut up. I bet even my friends think I‚Äôm a kiss-ass too.

I came in early to make some buttons for the art club fail sale. The only reason I‚Äôm trying is because I committed a long time ago. And that girl on newspaper interviewed me. I don‚Äôt even know if I can get Erin to help me during lunch.

I made my buttons and I forgot to ask him if we had permission to sell stuff until last night. I made him go all the way to the office for my stupid sale idea that will never profit. He asked me if I could explain the difference between digital design and graphic design and I failed miserably. I‚Äôm a useless sack of garbage who can‚Äôt even speak coherently. He probably thinks I‚Äôm just a sad, useless loser now. I was going to ‚Äúanonymously‚Äù donate some money to the sale so it would look like I actually accomplished something but now I‚Äôm broke.

I didn‚Äôt get the scholarship. Any scholarship at all. Hell, even 100$ would have helped a ton. I cried for two solid hours straight and my eyes stung for the next two days. All that work for NOTHING. Maybe it was my portfolio, maybe it was my recommendation letter, maybe my statement of intent, or maybe they don‚Äôt want a cis-gendered white female that doesn‚Äôt draw cartoons and isn‚Äôt very political. Milla hasn‚Äôt even gotten an email yet and I bet that means she got a scholarship. If SHE got one, then I‚Äôm definitely doing something wrong.

I did the math and I cant pay $2,900 by June 1st. It‚Äôs going to take a miracle if I want to go. I‚Äôm going to call today or sometime this week and find out about payment plans and options. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint Milla or Fink. I just want to run to the bathroom and cry and bang my head on the wall until I pass out.

Everything looks bleak. I‚Äôm an utter failure who can‚Äôt do anything right. I just passed Erin in the hall and asked about him helping me with the sale during lunch and he looked confused thinking it was just on Wednesday. I hate myself. I want to smash my head and just die. I‚Äôm gonna have to convince Mrs. H to let me take all three lunches. I hate myself. If I didn‚Äôt have art, I‚Äôd kill myself.

I just want to do a good job for once. "

Alright, time for a quick update. The past two days was alright.  I felt some anxiety yesterday while working today and a bit more today too.

I should have stopped watching it sooner though and went to bed with Her because She told me She felt sad but I still chose to just stay up and watch it instead. I am studying now for a quiz that I have tomorrow and am starting to feel pretty good with the material now. I think I'll run it through once or twice more and then call it a night. Go over it a bit before the quiz tomorrow. I also have to present this Wednesday so I have that to look forward to. Wowie, what a week we have coming up. That's all for now."
0,"UTI, Cold, Sad, Crush
This cheap vodka is giving me a uti. It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôm almost done with the liter.

Volunteered at the school today. As I was checking in I saw the back of Mr. M. Was hoping I‚Äôd see him later in the day. I didn‚Äôt. Not even after school. I think he left early.

I spent an entire day yesterday thinking about him. Then when I woke up today, i really didn‚Äôt care. I googled ‚Äúwhy do I keep having inappropriate crushes?‚Äù and it was actually very eye opening. So it more or less has to do with a certain part of our brain not having evolved in millions of years. Our brain tries to get us to have as much sex as possible with the hottest people as possible. Reproductive reasons. It said that women will develop these mad crushes when they are most fertile. I checked my period tracking app and SURPRISE Wednesday was my ovulation/most fertile day. It kind of made me laugh. I wonder if I went back and tracked all these mad crushes I‚Äôve had or these risky one night stands, I wonder if it would tie into my fertile days. Ah, science.

Anyway he‚Äôs still super hot and gorgeous but it‚Äôs not killing me with desire to fuck him today. Maybe it‚Äôs because I masturbated so much yesterday. I get drunk and high and just get so horny thinking of him. It was ridiculous. I couldn‚Äôt even cum anymore after some point. Ugh. Get a life. Meh.

I have plans tonight that I want to cancel. It‚Äôs so cold and I‚Äôve been feeling sad today. Plus i have that weird tingle in my bladder. I need to slow down on the drinking. I don‚Äôt want to fully develop this UTI. Gross.

I feel like smoking but the kids are up. It‚Äôs Friday so the oldest will be up for a long time. I‚Äôm lonely tonight. Best friend is dealing with relationship issues so she‚Äôs a downer. I have plans but just don‚Äôt have energy. I should go. I always dread going but then I have a great time. I will have to uber. Definitely won‚Äôt be able to drive afterwards. I‚Äôll think about it.

A quick post about yesterday. Yesterday was good. I think I had some bad thoughts earlier in the day during work a bit but I don't remember it being as bad as this past Tuesday. I feel a little anxious at the moment like I need to tell Her some things but I don't think that's really real. I did just make some poor choices, twice today, not to finish though and I was thinking about Her both times. But still, I need to get it together and not let those kind of things happen. I made hamburgers for Her and I last night for dinner and we went grocery shopping together. We also laid down in bed and hung out for a bit and made out a while too (progress!) I am a bit worried about feeling compelled to tell Her minor things before anything (potentially) goes further but I feel I need to. I also played some games with friends last night which I had fun doing. We made some good progress. I am not ready for school to start this week. I really need to start doing work for stuff this weekend, lame. Alright, that's all for now. I will post more later."

I brought him back to my place and we played an escape board game with my girlfriend that really wasn't that fun. But it was nice for the 3 of us to hang out together though. After that She went to sleep and he and I played a game together that we have been slowly playing to beat for years and we actually made some progress after being stuck for a while. We went to bed and got up and played stuff for a bit. I took him home and waited for him to get back from his meeting and I played smash bros with one of his roommates for a little bit.

They will have fun just being there with their friends and away from school! Piggyback off some other mom. That mom you know will be there and our kids are best friends. Stay with her group because you ‚Äúwant the kids to have fun together‚Äù but you really just need a support buddy.


Getting ready -
Bags
Lunches
Outfits
Things you will need throughout the day
Medical bag for child‚Äôs health concern.
Extra snacks and water.

Eat breakfast. Don‚Äôt drink too much coffee. Take a Xanax. Smile and most of all have fun. Take pictures and enjoy this time with your kiddo. Everything you‚Äôre ever anxious about ends up turning out fine in the end. There are millions of times you were working and wished you could chaperone the oldest‚Äôs school stuff. Now you have that chance with the littles. You got this. You‚Äôre a good mom. You‚Äôre a fun mom. You‚Äôre the best mom. You got this. I got this. I got this.

I like writing just a little bit of my thoughts down every day like this. To put my jumbled mess of a brain into words is hard, but worth it. Maybe to my future self, or just my ability to make coherent sentences. Wish I were like that aloud though.

I was walking on some pretty thin lines around Alex today. I told her too much, but not too much where she‚Äôll care. I spilled my dreams of just skipping town and exploring the country for a few months. Someday. When I can actually do that. Just maybe.

I realized how much I wants therapist. Not now, while I‚Äôm underage, but someday when I‚Äôm an adult. Where confidentiality is required by law. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll ever happen, what if someone in my church circles or my dad finds out I see a therapist. What if when I‚Äôm older my dad is helping me with some financial stuff and he asks me why I‚Äôm spending all this money on a therapist. How would I explain that?

But venting to the void might be my only option forever. I can scream it aloud here.

I WANT F TO ASK ABOUT MY SCARS/BRUISES.

I WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT MOM. ESPECIALLY WITH F. BUT ANYONE WILL DO.

I WISH I DIDN‚ÄôT HATE MYSELF SO MUCH.

I WISH I DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL ANXIETY ABOUT STARTING CONVERSATIONS.

I WISH I COULD HANG OUT WITH MIL AND AUG.

I WANT MY DAD TO BE MORE EMPATHETIC.

I WANT MY DAD TO LET ME GO TO THE ART CAMP. AND I FUCKING WANT A FULL RIDE SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE I WORK MY ASS OFF ON MY ART AND I WANT RECOGNITION FOR ONCE.

THERE. I said it. That was nice. I feel selfish just saying what I feel into words. Anyways, I gotta blow out my candles and turn off my oil diffuser because my eyes are stinging and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs from the lavender oil or just being dehydrated.

NOTE TO SELF:
Draw something to screenprint Sunday.
Hang up art fair stuff tomorrow during class/after school.
Scan Aug‚Äôs zines and drawings.
Make posters for sale Monday morning and cover the school with them.
Ask F if he still wants help making shirts Monday.
Spend Monday night burning the holes in my screen.
Aim to have projection project done and presented Wednesday.

I fantasize about flying away, hitchhiking over the great west, staying a few months in Washington to understand what Jeff Emtman talks about. I want to find the great secret, maybe not THE great secret, but a darn good one. One that will drive me creatively, give me a purpose other than the Lord Almighty. I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I knew the truth, I KNOW the truth, but is there more truth? I wanna be selfish and live my life jamming out to southern rock in a beaten up convertible under the big blue sky. I wanna become one with the pen. Purposely pour my essence and hopes and dreams and experiences into each mark.

But God damn, I love it here locally. I love to dream of being the crow, an alternate version of myself free to explore the nooks and crannies of the US. But I love my city too much. I‚Äôll never be able to pick up my pens and papers and socks and leave but I‚Äôve got it good here. I romanticize the loner life but I‚Äôm so pathetically dependent on other people and their opinions of me I‚Äôd be lost and probably end up committing suicide or something.
And I love F. Not love like romantically, but love as in the fucking traditional use of the word. I love you like family. Like someone I care about. A respect higher than all mountain peaks skyscrapers of this rock in space. I‚Äôve got where I wanted in my relationship with him, according to my diary entries from October. I did it. Yay for me? He‚Äôs perfect, and he cares about me. He CARES about ME! This annoying big kid who pesters him day and night. Who sees through my failures to someone who cares as much as him back. And because F is like this godlike father to me I want to share things with him. I‚Äôd even consider us friends, but I don‚Äôt think were quite there yet.

But he doesn‚Äôt know how much I struggle. He doesn‚Äôt know about my mom, well, maybe he does. I don‚Äôt know. He does, I think, I‚Äôm not sure he remembers. I just keep going back to that time after the field trip when I broke down and he genuinely cared about me and what was wrong and I should have just told him. I haven‚Äôt hugged anyone since that day. That was almost 4 months ago. He‚Äôll never know how much moms passing still pains me because he makes me SO happy. I simply can‚Äôt be sad around him. I‚Äôve never smiled more in his presence.

And maybe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt be free, because I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôd be without him in my life almost daily. I can barely make it through a prolonged weekend without him. God knows what will happen to me over summer. And when I graduate? I‚Äôll always find excuses to come back to class or talk to him. But it‚Äôll never be the same. But that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt leave this city. I can‚Äôt leave F, even if we never talk when I‚Äôm older, I just can‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know here, I want to know this city like my own backyard, but I don‚Äôt even know my backyard and I‚Äôve lived in this house for almost half a year, and this city my whole life. I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll keep drawing. All the places I‚Äôll never get to go, all the forests I‚Äôll never be intimate with, all the gas stations I‚Äôll never steal candy bars from. All the feelings I‚Äôll never experience. I‚Äôm landlocked, and at a crossroads spiritually and soon to be physically in a year or so. With each passing day of high school my future becomes more in reach. I can almost touch the life I‚Äôve dreamt of, the unknown.

Alright. Real short. Caught up with an old friend today. Gave me some stuff to think about. Feeling good about life. Will add more tomorrow. Ok. I didn't want to type much because She was sleeping last night and my keyboard is loud enough to wake Her up. I played Divinity with some friends last night and I liked it a lot. The gameplay in that game is super fun. People say the story is good but I am personally not super interested in it. I should pay more attention to it though. I have to work later today which is lame. I should work out today too since I have the time. Maybe I will do that after this. I also need to do a few productive things. Oh, I finally filled my taxes yesterday and should be getting a decent return which is pretty hype. Had a bit of anxiety yesterday but feel eh now.

I wanna hitchhike across the Southwest US. Get dirt in my eyelashes, the red sandy kind. I want to run up behind the big void like crows and throw pebbles at them until they migrate away. I‚Äôll follow them across the plains and into the Dakotas. I‚Äôll be free and lie beneath the big blue sky. Live in a shack on some plateau and draw the my guardian angels, the crows. I‚Äôll have so many when he sand storms come I‚Äôll stuff drawings between the windowpanes. I‚Äôll steal blocks of ink from store and grow my own berries. I‚Äôll take up analog photog and capture the beauty of the plains like the love child of Man Ray and Adams. The tortured artist liberated so freely. I become one with the sickly memories tainted with grubby charcoal fingers. Clogged noses and thorn bushes. Radios and terra-cotta. Spring water and tapioca pudding.

My hand becomes one with the crow. I smash my left into the kitchen drawer to punish my feeble longings for mankind.

So today I had the entire day free of class and work, and that was nice. The first thing I did when I woke up was write a paper for my Psych class. It went well actually, and I wrote the entire thing in like an hour, but then I went back and edited it so I probably spent like two hours total on it, give or take twenty minutes. I had also already been thinking about what I wanted to write about before writing so I just needed to put my thoughts on paper. After that I went with my mom to get food, burritos, and then I came home and watched a movie and ate with them. Then I worked on my paper some more, talked to my Daddy, played Rocket League, and now I‚Äôm doing my journal. All in all, a very good day, but also quite uneventful.

I did open another envelope today. It had a pair of non-sexual underwear in them paired with a sexual note telling me to cum in them tonight and leave them alone until the next task involving them, but I‚Äôm actually going to cum in them every time I jack off until then, just to prove my loyalty, and I‚Äôm due for a new Cum-Rag anyhow. \*Smirks\* Hehe"

I am not sure why some people like her as a Prof. What else happened today. She is helping me set up a dr. appointment which is nice of Her.

There is so much to process today. I can‚Äôt write it in my physical journal for fear of being found out. She may be dead? I can‚Äôt process it. I am a selfish human being. When she needed me, i went on with my normal life. I have kids of my own. Problems of my own. All of it. Awful. Please let her be alive. If she is alive, i promise to make more of an effort. I promise to try to help. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.

The girls. Alone. Why do people continue to have children. All the medical advancements that have been made. Birth control is pretty much fool proof.

We are all so imperfectly human. No one will achieve perfection. Everyone everywhere. Dark empty vessels. Looking for some kind of fulfillment.

I get it now. Suicide. I don‚Äôt blame you anymore. I get how it can get to the point where it is too heavy. Too much. I can see where at some point it‚Äôs just impossible to process an event and continue to live the life you‚Äôre expected to live.

I just want to drink. And smoke and take all the meds. I don‚Äôt want to feel or think about it. I want my body and brain to disassociate. To go into shock. To protect me from what I have to inevitably deal with.

I hate this world. It‚Äôs all been sadness. Heaviness and death. I was never given the skills to cope with traumatic events. They were always left up to denial and moving on. When have I ever grieved? I‚Äôm too busy to grieve.

Could it be? That she is gone forever? That lives upon lives are ruined and changed. That she could be dead for months and I didn‚Äôt even know. I hate this world. "

Today I came in a pair of new undies, which came from an envelope give to me by my Daddy, and I wore them cum soaked all day long. I much liked the idea and doing it for him. I've never done that before. Work was good, and my day went well, but I didn't have a chance to talk to my Daddy as much over the last few days, and then when we did talk I feel like we've been a bit disconnected at times and whenever that happens I become manic and a bit overwhelmed with fear that I've done something wrong and I just want it all to get better and make him feel better and figure out what I did wrong so I don't do it again. But also, some of it stems not from actions I've taken and instead from the conversations we have had over the course of today. I feel like I'm alone in an issue right now, and I feel like I've left someone else alone, and I feel bad but I also feel obligated to another and for that reason I must step back from the situation as a whole I feel. So really I'm doing to him what I am angry that someone else has done, and I hate to feel like I've been forced into a corner, but I chose to say what I said for a reason. I hope everyone finds inner peace and that everything works out for everyone, and I wish I hadn't brought it up to my Daddy just because it doesn't really involve him and the conversation was just misunderstood on both parts at times and it really should have been a conversation we had in person I feel, if we even found ourselves talking about it. But it's not worth either of our times now really because of the actions I've already taken and what I sent to the other. I'm ashamed a bit of what I said, and I would like to explain it all to the other but I don't feel like I'm allowed, and I don't like that. Maybe I like having a Dom and rules because I've felt like I've been controlled my whole life and I want to be able to have control over it really, but that's some therapy crap and I don't want control in most cases so it's a double edged sword or sorts.

  Today was a good day. I woke up, ate cereal, and then went to class. I was up late last night and only got five hours asleep, and that‚Äôs assuming I fell asleep right when I set my alarm, which I know I didn‚Äôt. When I finished my classes I came home and napped. Then I got up, hung out with my mom, ate some lunch, and then opened up one of the envelopes from my Daddy. I was surprised actually because the underwear in this envelope were much more covering than the others. I also sniffed and smelled the cum soaked undies I had been wearing for the last day and a half for him. They were quite musky, and quite ripe. I liked it though. Hehe

I showered and when I got out of the shower I dried my body and wrote ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs‚Äù again on my thigh, this time with red Sharpie. I also am supposed to write about that so I will do that now. I like the idea of being owned, and I like the idea of having it written on me because then I know that if I ever do something with someone else they will know and I will not have to feel guilty for not explaining, but also I shouldn‚Äôt have to I suppose. It also makes me nervous to do stuff with other people slightly, because I know I‚Äôll have to explain that. I‚Äôm sure no one is going to be like, ‚Äúcool‚Äù and not ask questions.

Work is good. Quit my 2nd job. Money is tight for now but I have less than 2 weeks until I'm basically debt free. So that's good.

My ex texted me, wants to look at us again. I told him no. And since then, it's just brought up all these old painful angry memories. I'm over him. Why do I still get angry?

She also said about me telling Her there was a bug I thought I heard that there was no point in telling Her because all it would do is freak Her out. I feel the same way about a lot of the stuff I feel anxious about randomly. It's just bad stuff or quick little dumb thoughts that can do nothing but hurt Her and don't really reflect how I actually feel.

0,"Day 2: to let ego go or no?
I've been working through this [list](https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/ultimate-reading-books-for-human-beings) of books. I've a bad habit of not finishing them, but I've been reading bits of *On The Shortness of Life*, *Wisdom of Insecurity* and the *Tao Te Ching*.

The concept of nothing has been terrifying to me, as I cling to this ego. Even as it slips I frantically claw at it, thinking if I lose it I lose me.

I'm glad the worst of that fear is dealt with.

I talked to some 14 year old today, oh the joys of the internet. They mentioned thinking about killing themselves but, not being ready. It breaks my heart but I relate, I know how it is to be lonely, but I know I can't be her friend either. I'm 21 and dealing with the same problems, except mine are abstracted to cosmic levels of, is it better for the universe to exist or not?

Funny, how I believe myself to have grown yet.. these patterns repeat. The despair takes a different form but it's the same sadness.

""Just don't forget there's still some things that'll shine in the darkness"" she says to me.

I welcome the invitation back into reality, but even so I tell her I have too leave. I have no bad intentions but it feels weird to me, I don't want this kid thinking she's in love with me, so I cut off contact the moment I sense her getting attached.

I'm sorry.

Low or high effort doesn't seem to matter, all that people care is that you're real with them. Real people are rare, it seems. This is evident in my popularity, at least in circles where people aren't yet so cynical they see through it into the machine they perceive me to be. I want to believe I'm more than just a machine, that my life isn't determined already and that I have freewill.

I dunno, though. Ego high makes me feel alive, but I know it's fake. Ego low makes me feel faded, I want to be complicated. Odd feelings during a strange time in my life.

I'm not popular, especially when I try to be. But whenever I quit trying it seems, everything flows into place perfectly. There's barriers in place in my mind that when I try to work around, everything backs up and feels like a lie. But when those barriers come down and I let it out without worrying about the consequences, about right or wrong, about my feelings or about who might hear it, that's when my highest quality writing comes out.

I cringe at myself.

There's beauty to be found in the disgusting mess, and vice versa. It's just difficult to untrain ourselves from only seeing one side of the coin.

I'm trying to sort this information as it's coming in, but it's not easily done in elegant order, so here it is in all it's disordered galore.

as always, peace and love friendo. "

Did tell Her some more stuff today but I just want to be able to live my life without feeling anxious. Blugh. Anyways. Today was good. I got a raise at my job which is very exciting. Her and I went to the movies together and had a good time there. We both liked what we saw. She also seemed fine with what I told Her and what I feel anxious about isn't a big deal I feel but I don't want to condition myself to feel compelled to tell Her eevvvveerrything in my life. Maybe I am overthinking things. Probably. I need to sleep because I got work early and have a whole lot to do this weekend. Here's to a better ending this time. "

First and foremost, the thing that was on my mind the most today was the fact that today is one year from my car accident. I was so afraid of today for the past few months that now I am a little bit ashamed of myself. I had so many irrational thoughts. I seriously nearly convinced myself that I was going to die today at one point. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to, or at least I really hoped, and today went over like just another day. It was raining, and it was Valentines, but otherwise nothing was out of the ordinary. That‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt feel stressed out or odd in general. At multiple points during the day today I nearly broke down to tear just thinking about the accident. Honestly I just tried to keep myself busy all day as to not have a chance to worry. I had class, and one of them got canceled, and then I went home and hung out with my mom. I talked a lot to her, and lately I have been, but I need to chillax a little. I feel like I talk to much lately. I even keep sending long text messages to people. I don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôve also felt much more aggressive lately. Like tonight at the gym I felt like I was getting pumped. I haven‚Äôt changed much lately, but the one thing that has changed for sure is that I have been eating a lot more lately. Maybe my body just has more energy now. Yay‚Ä¶ I have been feeling good about eating lately, but today I only ate this morning before school and then again before I went to the gym with Daddy. When he dropped me off, after going to the gym, I‚Äôll get to that, I was talking about it, and I had already felt bad about it, but saying it to him made me feel really sad for some reason. I think it was because I felt like I let him down, and I was also mad at myself, but I did feel like I let him down, or like I really did need him to remind me‚Ä¶ And that kind of makes me feel pathetic as well, like I can‚Äôt do it on my own‚Ä¶? But whatever, it‚Äôs fine, I can only hold myself accountable in the future and try to do better. I just felt bad also because I felt bad because he does remind me all the time, and last night he told me he would remind me more, and again today in person. I don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs burden. Also, I‚Äôll be fine; I know that. I really have been doing much better.

The gym was really great, and so was the time we spent in the car before and afterwards. I really liked watching him work out. He was very sexy.

Okay Journal, I‚Äôm way to tired to keep writing, and honestly now just feeling entirely too tired, and emotional. I will really dig into the gym later after I get some sleep."

i finally got my only off day since last week. this week been busy af at work and emotionally tormenting.  i spent valentine's day working and seeing all the cute guys buy their loved ones flowers and chocolates.  each time i rang the flowers and chocolates up i imagined they were buying them for me.  i was hoping something special would happen but nothing.  so one of my managers told me to close off the register to go on the speedy checkouts and it took me 30 minutes to get off because everyone kept lining up to get checked out even though my light was off.  luckily my last customer was this older black lady who made sure no one got in my line. kudos to her.  the rest of the night and events was a blurr thats hard for me to recall and put into words. i can say that some of my coworkers annoyed me. i was helping a customer and a coworker kept saying my name to ask a stupid question which made me wants to punch him in the face.  another one cant seem to follow directions because i told him to put the close sign on the converter  belt and he puts it on the damn candy rack. he is slow but a good worker.  i get frustrated with him alot when i ask him to do something and he asks the same damn questions 30 times.  so frustrating.

i havent been playing my 3ds or emerald copy because i chose to play emulators. emulators speed things up and thats what i like. playing the actual game takes up too much time and i dont want spend hours on something i played before.  the soon i get through the game and level up, the better. now that im back to playing gba emulators, my pokemon appetite is low and i get distracted easily now and spend time web browsing electronic devices. i see this mini laptop thats super portable to where you can put it in your pocket and play all the emulators of yesterday's game consoles. it runs about $800 and i had to ask myself do i really need it? no. i have a laptop that can do all of that. im always looking at laptops to upgrade to. better specs, a web cam and more up to date. i never do it because i dont feel like transitioning from one pc to another. i might as well pour my life into this laptop until  it dies. it does need a new battery which i can get off of amazon. it does enough for me.  i shouldnt say it because i dont want to jinx it and then it starts fucking up.

&#x200B;

i forget alot of shit now.  i remember some stuff but cant hold a grudge on it. it only occurs when im at work which is where all my pain comes from. i want to just let things go because life is too short for it. the term life is too short and you only live once remains ingrained in my mind. before i didnt want to be bothered with my family but now i want to spend time with them and do things. damn i should've scheduled an appointment with my therapist today. ohh well.

0,"day 1: sleep deprived oddity with nowhere else to write, right? alright.
Guess I started this today. My head's been quiet, but I think that's because I'm sleep deprived more than anything. I've been up reading bits of Light on Pranayama, Finite and infinite games, Sacred economics and was recommended to read ""The limits of evolution, and other essays illustrating the metaphysical theory of personal idealism""

I lack any fucks left to give. I'm working on a piece of writing I've lovingly called ""**How humanity ascends**"" not that I claim to have any answers, but it's a question worth TRYING to answer. It's interesting stuff.

Digging into all of this originally, I had the fear that in learning too much I would literally die. I would cease to exist, for having solved the God equation and uh... yeah, like get thanos snapped or something. OCD is lame, but the docs say I have BPD.

Fuck acronyms, I'm more than 3 letters anyways. I just came here because I wanted to write, and I'm the newest poster on my two favorite subs library of babel and shrug life syndicate already. Apparently, I'm a bit of an obsessive writer.

My brain is tired. I should rest, but I've been training myself, programming my mind, trying to become better than what I've settled for. I am not the first and I will not be the last, but I have to teach myself that I have to save the world because no one else will. It doesn't matter if that's true, but I have to believe it to succeed.

I've got some wild ideas, but I like to play around with these thoughts.

Honestly it's just nice to have a place to type without caring about how elegant I am or how artful my prose is, just to ramble vent and  vomit up some thoughts to look at later with a more well rested eye.

I wanna say I've learned a lot from reading but honestly, I've just realized how much more there is too learn. I need to learn how to wake up from this cultural machine I've found myself in, like Morpheus I see I'm in a matrix but slowly, surely, I'm learning how to break free. It's difficult, I'm not going to deny, to tell what we've fallen for at times.

Do we have freewill, or do we just believe we do?

Questions like this plague me. But now I'm so tired my minds drawing a blank; tablu rasa

shoulda' been a Rasta,

pastafarian lucifarian light bringer and dark slayer; words vowels verbs and nouns without sound written and sneezed out, i like word associations without regard to taboo or cultural sensitivities, connotations are held in the eye of the reader and the writer has willingly disgarded his mind for the time being with this.

i digress. I have a lot of research to do and this is my only outlet.

peace and love bitches,

I gotta pretend I have an ego or I might disappear, don't take it personally. I'm actually quite humble. The only thing I know is that I don't know

Who would have thought that Socrates said that first? All this time, I thought I was being original.

as above so below, the greatest is shown in the smallest; esoteric oddities aside nothing matters and we're all going to die,

in spite of this, or maybe because, I've decided to make it my life's work to wake people up to the terrifying reality of it, and make a bunch of half-clever jokes about it.

Only because I can't find another girl who'll electrocute me, but that's a story for another diary entry.

Nowadays I have been trying to be confined to myself. But, it is very difficult to be happy being like that. I try to be with my friends more and more but there is nothing fun being with them.

There is a technical festival held in our college and everyone is busy with themselves. But, they are so busy that they don't even have time for a few seconds. What's with it? They don't even want me here. I have never felt so unwanted in anyone's life. Its been too much for me to be with them and pretend to be happy and all. I try to act cool with them but, all I do is do reckless things and all. I am sorry penzu there are many things to tell but I don't want to. I am sorry penzu I am an asshole.

All I know and I want you to know is that, there is no one who loves me and likes to have my company. If someone doesn't need me then I am the last person on this planet they would want to be with. I don't know what's with me but, no one likes me."

Alright, I'm back. Today was Valentine's Day and it was pretty nice.  I feel anxious though because I thought of stuff I felt like I need to tell Her but didn't want to tell Her today and will tell Her tomorrow unless She asks me tonight. Ugh. I don't miss this feeling one bit and I hate it. I need to take some deep breaths and relax a bit probably. I do feel a bit excited to get back into doing this. Things have gotten worse in ways that I kind of didn't notice but I feel like I felt a lot better and had less bad thoughts and much less anxiety. We will have to see if that continues once I start this back up again. Her and I hung out today though and it was nice. I had some worried and bad thoughts pop up throughout the day but I got through them. Almost cried. I made some baked mac and cheese for Her and I and I also got brownie mix but we didn't make it. We watch Annihilation together and some random youtube videos. It was a nice day I feel. This will go better this time."

Alright, time for a new attempt. I fuck things up yet again and I feel like I didn't even see it. In hindsight it's a bit easier to see though. It sounds so easy on paper. Just be honest and open. But the things I thought or did weren't giving me anxiety and I feel like I didn't have any actual bad internet but there's no way for Her to know if I'm telling the truth or not and now we are just right back at square 1 and it sucks and She is upset and hurt which sucks. I worry a lot about if I know what love really is and if I am capable of actual love. I feel like I don't think about Her during the day a ton, just wondering what She is doing and stuff, and I feel like I wouldn't be too sad if my loved ones died or that I would get over it quickly. I wish I could be one of those people that say ""There's not a day goes by that I don't think about her"" about my mom but it isn't true. The truth is I hardly think about her. But I loved her and I love Her, I think. I don't know what to do. It's a viscous cycle of me freaking out and feeling like I might be getting feelings for someone (which didn't happen this time though which is why I didn't say anything because I knew I didn't even know this person and I just met them on Monday and it was just /is just lust or something) but She understandably feels hurt and I don't know what to do about it. And I still feel undesired physically and emotionally by Her but why would She want to hang out or have a physical relationship if I am dressing nice in hopes that people find me attractive (or a particular person) not that I would go anywhere with it, but if the shoe were on the other foot I definitely wouldn't be happy about it. Why does being happy feel so hard. We've only been intimate once in two years and I don't masturbate because I had an issue with that in the past but it's difficult having those two conditions coexist. I feel primitive or something saying it but I do get frustrated with Her and feel unwanted sometimes and it can lead to me having sexual thoughts of other people but I have gotten a lot better about that lately I feel. Life's hard. School is hard too. To a better ending this time."

my doctor decided to increase my antidepressants dosage from 100 mg to 125. i started taking my meds again today and i dont feel too much difference.  only thing im feeling is fatigue.  everyday when im at home, all i do is nap.  nap and going to work is my life at the moment. im too lazy to go to the gym and i always forget to buy healthy stuff. im gaining weight but i dont really care. only time ill actually care is when people start calling me fat. so sad.

sunday night i worked the closing shift and the manager i closed with was decent until the last 10 minute she was bitching me out because i was taking a long time on an order that had WIC. she didnt have the right item so i had to send a bagger to get the right stuff. the bagger kept getting confused and coming back to ask me which items to get which was annoying me. finally i said fuck it and just overrided the WIC item she wasnt supposed to have. one of the night grocery clerk was making fun of me because the closing manager was chewing me out. i didnt appreciate it. after that nothing new happened. just went home in a bad mood.

i switched from iphone to android. it just so i can play my pokemon games on the gba emulators. i been playing the legit pokemon emerald cart but im not even fully invested in it. it feels like a chore now to play it since ive played through it a dozen time. i played and restarted fire red and leaf green so much its a nightmare just to play it for a 2nd.  my pokemon phase is dying down since i put down omega ruby. playing games on emulators is a better choice for me because i can fast forward through all the boring bullshit.  Having the actual game cartridge can be good for collections. i want to play pokemon emerald on my phone but then i get distracted with texting, instagram which im too lazy to look at and web browsing for electronic devices.  once i finish paying off my 2ds, maybe ill get another laptop off fingerhut.

im using my android phone as a gateway for entertainment. i dont know how long the interest will last.

its late at night here so ill try to fall asleep. if not ill window shop.

maybe ill use my twitter again. i never use it because my mind stay blank 24/7.  "

On my worst days, I want you to be my best. On your worst days, I will be yours.

I like to believe that as much as this world is filled with beautiful coincidences, some things are meant to exist.

And I believe that somewhere out there - someone is also searching for the person I am just as I am for you.

The curves and edges on our pieces would fit perfectly as if we were made for one another. It's no longer a search & struggle to fit into someone who wasn't made for me. Instead it will just be.

Am I a dreamer to dream about these things? An idealist living in a cruel world of chance, logic & coincidences?

No one is certain...

But the uncertainty makes me happy - because the moment we uncover whether the universe is a product of chance or intentional creation, these questions will all be answered and imagination will have sadly to give way to facts.

I like how no one in this world knows how things really are and I want it to be that way for as long as I live."

Tired and drained.

There is a certain threshold for the amount of pressure one can handle. Even more so when the pressure stems from within.

Stuck between the mounting pressures of the inner & outer world, one has to fight hard to survive.

Even though, I don't belong into any religion.

I like to believe that out there there is a creator, one who creates every molecule & every fiber of this universe with intention, with reason, with a goal.

Everything exists to fulfil a purpose (or more). Rather, everything exists to play a role would be a more accurate way to say it; for we are all but actors on our own little stages with a horde supporting casts, extras and props while looking like coincidences when in fact, placed at the right place & the right time for a very specific reason.

For without this belief, our world will simply crumble under the idea that we are all nothing but side products of chance...."

Alright, time for another post. Man, it has been a while. I kind of felt like all of these were getting pretty cookie cutter and that I wasn't getting anything out of them anymore so I took a hiatus. I also just kind of got bored of doing it/didn't feel like it anymore. Regardless of the reason, I am back for now. I am back because I relapsed. I don't feel as bad about it as I would have back in the day, especially because my thinking at the time wasn't too inappropriate, but it still feels pretty crappy. This new semester is picking up.

i've never been into self help literature. i just never bought it. what i really believe and that is actually what these books, let's say, propagate is that you and what is on your mind control your life. only you are bettering or worsening your life.

recently i've been through confusing period. i didn't know what i'm doing and i've been wondering what is my purpose. i got to the point where i just sat on the couch and watched tv. and i never watch tv. then i realised that i need to clear up my mind. i need to do some physical exercises, i need to go hiking, to breathe a little. lately winter has been dark and grey. i like it, but it's been enough of it. spring is coming and it is what is making me excited. on easter i get to see my favorite cousin. every encounter with him enriches me in some way. we don't get to see each other enough.

i'm starting this research for my final project for college. it is about architecture, what i'm studying, and it is about psychology. i've always been a psychology geek and i wanted to merge these two things i really like. psychology of us and space that surround us is really interesting matter. space we surround ourselves with really impact our daily lives. but the most important thing that impact our lives is our mind. the surrounding space is just a reflection of our inner selves and our inner selves are reflection of what surround ourselves too actually.

my brother is working abroad. i'm really happy for him, because now he's doing something for his life. he's been living aimlessly for a while and now that is a big change for him. he seems at peace with himself now. we all should be at peace with ourselves.

things with my friend s. are weird lately. last time we hang out we had an argument. at start it was about the unimportant matter but then i mentioned a thing from the past that's been in my head for a long time. i just thought it was the right moment to mention it, but i was wrong. our problem, of my friend s. and i, is that we have a bit different communication styles. she's a sensor and i'm an intuitive.

0,"I didn't know I could read in dreams
I had always thought it was impossible to read coherent texts in dreams or that they would be blurry, but it seems that the only difference is that the texts don't make a lot of sense sometimes and that if you read them again, the text is different.

I dreamt I was looking for a dungeon making game. I googled ""dungeon"", then ""dungeon game"" and then ""dungeon making game"". On one of the first results, I got as a first result something that said something along the lines of ""be a hero, expand your influence, build an army"" and other buzzwords. As I read all of that, I asked myself why building a dungeon would imply building an army or expanding any influence. The legit result had a game as first result and I clicked the website.

The website had some traditional options. I looked for a download button but didn't find it. Instead, there was a start or a play button. I clicked it and there was a form. I could easily read what was in there, but it was very nonsensical and kicked me out of that scene. I particularly remember a part where 3 to 5 form fields were field with one word each. In total, vertically, they said something like ""tie the titan"" or a text where one web dev was telling the other that he should do something, but it was pretty surreal."

february started well. i'm now aware where i'm standing and where i'm heading to. these things are of a great importance to me.

in the month of january i was a mess. i was trying to find a source of my problem for a while and here it is. i needed a cleanse, mental and physical. life is about balance. you need to be a mess sometimes to find a way. because when you're a mess, that's when you start to wonder.

february is a new start for me, that is each year. i clean a house, paint walls, start to eat better food, start to think about coming spring. i love winter and i love snow, but with the end of january i start to get weary of all of it. i need some blue and i need some green and even yellow, even if i love the whiteness and minimalism and freshness.

life is about feasting and fasting. sometimes the table is full of different dishes and you don't know what to eat first, and sometimes you spend whole day only drinking ginger tea. and that is completely ok. i love love ginger tea.

mental and physical balance. it is what is important folks.

and sleep. i'm better when i sleep enough and sleep well. but good sleep comes with balance anyway."

im off today from work so im at my fave spot, the library. i took an uber to get here as i did not feel like walking. my uber driver was nice and handsome so i gave him a $2 tip.  i feel depressed and tired after yesterday. i had a long busy day at work because of the superbowl and the fact that its sunday.  in the beginning it was nice but then i got my feelings hurt by my coworkers talking about me saying im weird and that i always ask weirdass questions which i do. i do it because im very imaginative and i like to show it off. the thing is they were talking about me in front of me as if i wasnt there. i guess its a good thing because it wasnt behind my back but at the same time it made me upset. later on i was saying boom boom shaka laka to another coworker for fun and he kept saying i dont understand that word in a blunt kind of way.usually he's nice but he was crabby because he had to miss the superbowl so that made it worse.  then the grocery manager who i have a good work relationship with was very pushy and aggressive and i didnt like that. at that point i was so ready to go. i went home and took a good nap. i forgot to mention or maybe i did mention that my boss thinks me and my other female coworker are dating because we always by each other talking. she is older and just looks out for me. my  boss told me all the other cashiers think we're dating and that was very crappy. when i told the  older female coworker friend about it she couldnt believe it. now lately we havent been texting each other much. i logged off my social media that has my coworkers on it. i love them but they make me so upset.  somehow i always come to work seemingly happy, friendly and full of weirdness. in actually i hate my job which ive stated numerous times and i hate some of my coworkers.

0,"Tired of the bullying
I was born disabled and without a whole brain. There's a huge portion of my brain that does not exist. There's a huge part that developed but got damaged in the womb. There's a part that developed and is whole. All the damage started when my mom was in her first trimester with me.

There are things I can understand on my own. There are things I can understand if others explain them to me. There are things I will never be able to understand.

I am 41 years old. If I didn't get raped, I'd still be a virgin. I can do some things on my own. Some things I can't do unless others physically help me. There are some things I can't do at all. I ask others to do them for me.

One of the things I have never been able to understand easily is knowledge about things pertaining to sex. I have gotten bullied offline for not knowing about sex and I have gotten bullied online for my lack of knowledge, even here on Reddit.

My disabilities and ability to think also become a bigger challenge when my feelings get hurt. My brain doesn't know how to deal with it. Others have acted like I need to toughen up or just get out more or whatever. I can't explain my challenges to them. They hurt me with their words. Some say it's just words or it's just online. I have literally ended up paralyzed from things people said to me online or pictures or texted things I have seen online. I have literally ended up in the hospital and unconscious, leaving my doctor with the unfortunate task of trying to bring me back to life when I almost die. All because my body, heart and brain don't know how to handle the pain.

Emotional pain turns into physical pain. Doctors have told me before not to get online until they feel it is safe for me to do so. I am addicted to socializing online. I can't do it offline. Do my bullies want to pay my medical bills?

I am tired of showing vulnerability by being a chatty friend and others being mean to me. I am tired of daring to try to understand sex topics in Ask Reddit or Ask Women or in comments I read. I am tired of having to look things up online because someone wants me to chat with them but does not believe I don't know stuff and won't answer me or answers me kind of but then bullies me if I get appreciative and hug them since I am a hugger.

People tell me to look things up online, but I can't if I don't first hear about the terms or words. And why can't the talkers explain if they're going to bring it up in the first place?

It's bad enough I get bullied for my developmental challenges and being so sensitive emotionally ad if I dare say a guy likes me but we aren't dating. It's bad enough I get bullied for various other reasons and at all.

I had to block a man a few minutes ago. He told me he was going to downvote all of my posts. I thought he was a nice guy when we chatted in comments. I already got over sixty down votes from asking a question about porn when the question was what is something that confuses us. I felt so hurt that people would down vote me for not knowing better about porn. And then I see another question on a subreddit I follow about what annoys us and I mentioned how sad it makes me when I see down vote avalanches. That is where I met this guy who I eventually blocked. Is he gonna pay my medical bills? I guarantee he won't offer one penny. But he sounded very eager to cause me more pain.

Some people born like me said they talk with others but don't become friends with others because of how bad stress is for us. This is a comedy show or a critic's event for others, but for us, it is our real life. I told a guy years ago online with others that tempers and cussing is very bad for me to deal with. I mentioned some things that happen to me. What did he do? Years later, when he got mad at me when I got mad that he refused to answer me about negativities I was hearing about him when he said he likes me and others said he was faking it because he doesn't like handicapped girls, he lost his temper and cussed at me. And I am pretty sure he's way nicer to others in his life who can handle him being that way."

Last night I had a dream that I was in a bus with people I knew in my dream, but I cannot, for the life of me, remember who. Given how I was feeling in the dream, I assume they were beloved relatives living oceans away; maybe a past lover.

We drive for what feels like hours, and talk about getting ready for something. The road, as expected, turns into a huge rollercoaster and we‚Äôre climbing up, ready to drop. I was bracing myself, stressed internally but trying to show outward bravery, think about opting out, but don‚Äôt. Just grit your teeth and go for it.

We‚Äôre dropping, and I can see the entire world. It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôm unable to keep from smiling,and realizing that, I can only smile more. I‚Äôm not in control and don‚Äôt need to be. I‚Äôm free. I guess that‚Äôs why I love and hate you so much. I can‚Äôt control you, but something in me will die if there‚Äôs any truth to my irrational fears about you.

Anyway, I know things have changed now. I see more good in people and have more hope. Learning to let go of the past disappointments, betrayals, and sadness has been the hardest and most beautiful thing I‚Äôve done for myself so far. I‚Äôm so glad my often stressful dreams have turned into me feeling happy and free in some Wonderland rollercoaster. "

depression is slowly starting to creep back. Thursday I went to Walmart to get some groceries and the place was packed. all because of the snow storm coming. I was able to get my things and checkout. I paid $110 dollars! it is the first time shelling out that large amount of cash like that. im still in shock. Friday I went to work and it was a zoo. there was lines all throughout the aisles. it is crazy how so many people were freaking out about the storm. one of my managers asked to work over and I agreed. it was a 4 hour shift and I ended up doing 6. it was supposed to be 7 but things ended up dying down. I asked if I could leave then and the girl said yes. the other manager got mad and yelled at me saying they had breaks to fill out, then they find out the other cashier is staying an hour longer. the other manager yelling at me ruined my night. 2nd time this week I got yelled at by a manager.  it been causing my depression to come back. im hoping it goes away. maybe going to therapy would help. I haven't been to therapy  in months so maybe that can help. I don't like some of my managers at work. they are snotty assholes who take their frustrations out on other people. the manager who yelled at me is a bitch. nobody likes her because she is rude to everyone. even customers. its crazy how she is working in retail. bitches like her need to go find a man or something. thankfully im off today.

everything was fine the last couple of days until yesterday. work was real shit. one of my supervisors accused me of taking a 40 minute break when it was merely 16. I left at 8:25 pm and came back at 8:43. as I was heading from the breakroom he started paging me. when I came to him he was real snotty and dickish about it and even wrote it down on the breaksheet! he gave me a hard time until he finally clocked out and went home. I actually liked him until that point. im really pissed that he thought I took a long break. I told the other supervisor about and she said not to worry about it and that I wont get in trouble for it since im not one of the workers that do it on a regular basis.  im so mad at him. I almost unfriended him on facebook but that wont do any justice.  im off today thankfully so I wont have to deal with him. I guess my feelings were hurt. next time I work and he's working, he will be getting the silence treatment from me.

on other things, they increased my credit limit on fingerhut to $400.

I added express shipping so it should arrive tomorrow or Friday.

I‚Äôve slept better today than in a long time (idk if that‚Äôs even English) I‚Äôm still sick... and I didn‚Äôt go to work either (Sick since Wednesday) I started a new series (Titans on Netflix. It‚Äôs quite good actually) Cleaned my room. Got some Designing done and Bought Injustice 2 for the pc. I also played it for like 6ish hours wich I haven done in a while. Playing for that long that is.

I actually enjoy this very much... I like to write, apparently. It also helps me to sort my thoughts and it improves my writing/speech skills on the iPad and in englisch. I‚Äôve wasted so much time today doing basically nothing and it has been so refreshing. My roommate is at her parents so I have the whole apartment to myself.

Recently I just feel down. I don‚Äôt really know why tho. I used to power through these times with ease. What changed?
Well, it wont make any sense if I don‚Äôt explain myself.

In the 3rd quarter of 2018 I failed school. In America it would be college I believe. (I‚Äôm from germany)

The ‚Äúcollege‚Äù in Germany is significantly harder than the one in America, I just don‚Äôt want to sound dumb lmao (Why, no one will ever read this)

I went to a shool where you have to get 2 certificates to pass. The normal school one and the apprenticeship thing. If you don‚Äôt pass the apprenticeship you don‚Äôt get the normal
Shool certificate.

Long story short: I did manage to get the school part done but the apprenticeship? I failed that.

I should also add that I‚Äôm very self conscious. I really try to put myself out there to cope with my anxiety so if you knew me, you wouldn‚Äôt notice that I‚Äôm very uncomfortable most of the time.
I also keep the smallest things to myself because I don‚Äôt want to annoy anyone.

I should also say that this is not the ‚ÄúHah redditor with no friends‚Äù type thing. I did get bullied in 7th to 8th Garde, but after that I found real friends. And yet I still feel alone. They all have girlfriends (The one from one of my best mates is my roommate lmao) so unavoidably they have to set priorities and more than often that means to not have time for me.

I don‚Äôt even feel left out that much but it just really makes me question if I want a girlfriend of my own. Just someone that is always there, that I can share my passions with. (I‚Äôm sorry if this gibberish isn‚Äôt making any sense)

So most of the time I‚Äôm on the pc or I‚Äôm working.

Wich segways right into the next issue. I hate my job. It‚Äôs not even like that‚Äôs the only thing ill do for the rest of my life, but it just annoys me to the point where I‚Äôm getting physically sick.

I have to work tho. I don‚Äôt have a degree, a master or any sort of qualification for a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. My rent has to be payed... my whole life situation has to get funded somehow.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong. I have enough money to do exactly that. I‚Äôm rarely short on cash.

It will all get better when I finally go back to shool in September, I know, but the way/path im on rn is really not the way for me. I‚Äôm stuck. I draw and I edit videos. At least I used to.
When I come home from work i just don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. New games get boring within a heartbeat and YouTube has only so many videos.

Really my question is: how does one pull through such difficult and emotionally taxing times? How can you still be creative and draw, even though you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything really.

I sell my ‚Äúartworks‚Äù on Redbubble and I really want to continue to grow but hows that going to happen if I cant draw new designs?

And most importantly: I dont want to fail, not just in shool but in life. I have the feeling I wont be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù or what I want to be.

I really don‚Äôt like writing but this actually helps rn. To anyone going through a similar time at the moment. Please PM me. We can just talk or find solutions but being there for each other is the most important thing. And isn‚Äôt that what its all about?"

I decided to hitchhike back to atlanta. I am excited to see my family once again. I am going to start a new life and hopefully get married and have kids. A bus driver on bus 22 by the name of mr brown was kind enough to drive me all the way back to my house. When I got home at first my family start saying I‚Äôm so glad you're here. But in less than 5 minutes of me finally returning home my family started yelling at me for never calling them or sending them a postcard. So I immediately decided to tie a rope around my neck and commit suicide in front of my entire family.

    I've been back for a few days now and currently my family has locked me in my room. As soon as i escape i am going to blow up the house with all my family inside it because they did not want me to commit suicide so they stopped me from doing so. But i am going to make them wish that the did not stop me from commenting suicide.

When I blew up the house none of my family was in there but that's okay, because simply killing them that way would be offering them too much mercury. Also if they were dead they would not forced watch atlanta burn to the ground for what they did to me. All major cities must be destroyed because they are responsible for all the pain and suffering in the world, but first I must gain a cult following and doing that won‚Äôt be easy but nothing in life is easy. I will have to get military weapons and a ton of hydrogen bombs. So I can wait a few years and gain power in the shadows. I think I will call my cult the league of environmentalist. We will come out of the shadows  during super bowl 53 in Atlanta‚Äôs nfl stadium and reveal our plan for the whole world to see and Detonate a bomb destroying everyone in the city. I will then safely watch billions die in Alaska. After most of the people are dead I will kill my family with a flamethrower while saying you should of just let me die. Then I will will finally kill my self  by neck rope

Hello. First post of the year.

So I saw another gynecologist for a second opinion regarding my cysts. The dermoid in my ovary and the fibroid in my uterus.

It's highly possible that I'll lose the ovary. Dermoid cysts don't go away. I was hoping to see if the ovary can be salvaged, but there's a high change that it won't due to how big it is and that dermoids are intertwined with the ovaries usually.

3 weeks has gone by since I was given the news that the ovary will be removed if I want to remove the cyst. I'm taking it a little better now, but I'm still sad about it. You know, at least it's not cancer. I still potentially want kids.

The 2nd gynecologist said that due to my fibroid cyst being in my uterus, there's also risk of potentially losing my uterus too, but it's unlikely due to the fact that it's just one cyst and not multiple. Side note that multiple cysts can make it harder to salvage an organ, but in my case it's just one. I may need a c-section during birth should I get pregnant in the future, but it depends on how much uterus was taken out and if I even still have a uterus, which would take out the chances of having children.

It took me half a year to get diagnosed since I had a shitty doctor, but the good doctor that I switched to made sure that I get the examinations I needed. Unfortunately it is too late to save the ovary, but not too late that it is not a medical emergency and I'm not in excruciating pain and I can still live my every day life.

I still haven't broken the news to my mom and we have a language barrier, so it's going to be a frustrating time to talk to her about this. I would ask my coworker who speaks the same language as my mom, but he doesn't even know I have these issues and I don't want to subject him to this.

Anyway, all that's left is for the gynecologist's staff to send the request to get authorization for surgery, to have me come back in to go over what I need to know, and then... surgery.

I'm honestly still scared about surgery as there's always a risk. I've never had surgery before. I don't know how my body will react. I'm scared things can go wrong, you know? That's what gives me the most stress apart from losing my ovary and having a harder time having kids.

Also work was understanding that I'd have to potentially call off 30 days due to health reasons. Though it was shitty of corporate to reset my sick hours because they didn't notify us and I could've used my hours instead of saving them when I did call off work for health reasons before the reset.

So yeah. I've been confidential about my issues and not too many people know about it. I don't like my business being out like that. Typing this out is still kind of hard honestly.

I'm scared, but I hope all goes well."

Friday was my coworker's 18th birthday and me and another coworker went to see a movie and then we stopped at a restaurant and grabbed something to eat. all 3 of us had a blast that day. I also met her best friend and when we went back to her place, we played monopoly for 3 hours til It was time to go back home. the 3rd coworker with us was a guy and he is okay looking. I am attracted to him at work but is a little gross. he is also weird so I don't think we could mess around. the next day I stopped by her house for her birthday party. it was a little gathering so nothing major. it was decent except for the drama going on with them. my coworker's sister has been sleeping with this guy my coworker and her mom hates. he  been controlling her and making her distance from the family and its causing major problems. everyone started crying and stormed off to their rooms for a moment. it was a bit uncomfortable to see  the drama unfolding but I cant help but feel sorry for them and hope for the best. other than that nothing special been going on in my life. im still looking for ideas to where and what to do when I take a vacation. its good for a  year and then ill lose it if its not used.

everything is so fucking confusing. my anxiety is so up and down. i can‚Äôt sleep at night because my fear of sleeping alone just keeps getting stronger and stronger. i need to sort my shit out, go to the gym, stop smoking and stop drinking in such large quantities. i need to get prepped for when school comes back in a month. i‚Äôm so nervous for my exam results. today i broke down because i just thought about how much i hate myself. whenever i look in the mirror i feel disgusted. in the past year i went from 48 kilos to 58 which is disgusting. i don‚Äôt fit into my old clothes. i hate my image. and then there‚Äôs him. he is so in my mind all the time and i just want him so bad but i can‚Äôt because i‚Äôm so insecure and i have too much self hatred to actually invest my time into someone. however i‚Äôm reckless with hooking up with guys and one night flings. i am distracting myself from the one guy i want even though i can‚Äôt have him. tomorrow night i am getting drunk and i know i will smoke. believe it or not i‚Äôm only 15. i just want to feel young but i feel like i‚Äôve grown up and matured too quickly and i don‚Äôt get to enjoy the experience of being ‚Äòyoung‚Äô. i don‚Äôt smoke or drink for the ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô i do it because it‚Äôs became a part of my routine. if i gymed as much as i smoked or drank i probably would not hate myself as much. i need to do a few things this year. i need to improve myself. i am so fucking sad and depressed. it‚Äôs my anxiety‚Äôs fault and my PTSD‚Äôs fault (this is a public journal so in case any one reads this i just want to say i am professionally diagnosed from a psychiatrist. i am not saying i have this for the ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô) but it‚Äôs also my fault for not trying to get better and not trying to treat myself right. i treat myself so badly but i deserve better. i hate myself so much but i know i deserve better. this is a fucking ramble and a fucking mess. i‚Äôm so lost.

I didn't feel like waking up today. Sometimes I try to sleep for as long as possible, so I'm not reminded of my unemployment. Lol. I feel empty and hollow inside, but have to pretend I'm perfectly fine cos I don't wanna worry my parents.

I'm praying for a miracle. Honestly, I'm expecting a rejection from that place, and I feel like that's gonna get me down..... but what can I do right. Gotta continue on with the interview process. And the application process. God, please give me the wisdom to find something good and right for me - I put my trust in you. "
0,"new year same thoughts
its 2019 woohoo.... i guess. i havent done much except go to work and play my nintendo 3ds which is starting to take over my life. my christmas was good. i didnt do anything except play my nintendo 3ds and went to my coworker's house. only things i got for christmas is a personal table for my things, candy and a scarf. its not much but its something. i went and bought a regular 2ds with super mario bros built in. i know i didnt need it since i have the 2ds xl but i really wanted it. i hacked my 2ds xl but unhacked it because i was so worried about getting banned by nintendo. i know i was fine but my fear was too strong. i would hack the 3ds regular but i want to keep that clean. ill just hack my 3ds xl that i bought 4 years ago.  i have 3 3ds and yet im still looking online to buy another one. i shouldnt be doing it. instead i should be putting money aside for a nintendo switch. it is the one i really want.

&#x200B;

my coat from fingerhut came last friday. so far its decent but could be better. as soon as i get done paying it off, maybe my credit limit will go up to where i can get the nintendo switch. i started playing pokemon go again because i heard you can transfer the pokemon you caught to pokemon lets go. soon all the waiting will pay off.

&#x200B;

i didnt set alot of goals for 2019. what i want to do this year is take more vacations and do fun things. the hard part is that i dont know what to do. i need some ideas.  dating would be a good idea but im not mature enough for it. a friend with benefits would be nice.

&#x200B;

2018 was a year of change. i came out to my family, i got help for my depression when it was really bad. i went to the gay pride parade and actually had sex whitch wasnt all that great.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2019 here i come. thats all i got for now. my brain is messed up so i cant think of anything else to say. i keep forgetting to use the journal app on my phone as my reminder. im so fucked. 25 years old and still fucked up....."

It's New Year. And here I am, feeling degraded as usual. The year is ending but I don't feel excitement. But rather some kind of pain and hollowness. Reminiscing some things somehow made me feel down as usual. I should really stop that habit. Guess, I should do something...

my legs are getting sore. The past four days I‚Äôve been running, biking, walking, or going on the elliptical. I need to get energy out but damn my legs are paying the price. Even though I‚Äôm exercising like crazy I‚Äôm eating a lot - I have two pints of vegan ice cream in the freezer, a trader joe‚Äôs baguette and a dayia pizza. Oh, and I have so much Christmas candy and a package of Oreos. There‚Äôs so much junk food here and it‚Äôs helping me wallow but not helping my self-esteem.

honestly, besides going to the gym, I did nothing today. I played around with makeup and watched Youtube videos about cheating and Gilmore Girls. I learned a lot about the psychology of infidelity and it kinda fucked me up. I know it doesn‚Äôt have to do with me, but it‚Äôs messed up that it has to negatively affect my life so much. Like why the fuck am I dying, missing you constantly, obsessively thinking about you, and waiting for you to talk to me when you cheated on me. I don‚Äôt deserve this.

I miss you. I hope you are ready to talk for the new year. There are so many things I want to tell you."

Annoyed. No, my son's dairy ALLERGY cannot be cured with lactose free milk or by adding sugar to his bottle to make  it more digestible. Allergy is not lactose intolerance.

My son's eardrum ruptured in the allergist's office. He was fine when we came in. Did the histamine scratch test cause it? Poor kid. This is a difficult season of life.

I‚Äôm 21, I have a nearly 3 year old son I don‚Äôt see because he lives with his father and we don‚Äôt get along, I have a 5 month old daughter while lives in a hostel with me and my current boyfriend and I‚Äôm pregnant again. I can‚Äôt abort, and honestly I‚Äôm so fed up with everyone being up my ass about how I‚Äôm a shit parent.

I know I‚Äôm a good mum, my baby is very happy and social, always clean even though she has reflux, growing well.. I‚Äôm not allowed to see my family because my social worker deems them unsafe. Why? Well, my mum‚Äôs house is awful because she‚Äôs a hoarder with agoraphobia. My cousin is apparently one of the most violent people in town because on her police report it says she assaulted 4 people (I was there, she was attacked by her daughter and daughter‚Äôs boyfriend, her other daughter and I broke the fight up. She did not assault ANYONE. I can‚Äôt believe it was twisted like that!) and the social worker can‚Äôt even be bothered to go and meet the rest of my support network.

I feel like I have nobody, I‚Äôm not allowed to be left alone with the baby because I have depression. I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to be a mother. Our hostel charges more than a 3 bedroom flat so we‚Äôre in debt (it‚Äôs run by a charity btw) our universal credit is a bunch of crap too, it‚Äôs not enough to pay rent and food so we only pay small rent and rely on food banks.

I get treated like I‚Äôm incapable of anything, spoken to like I‚Äôm a child or straight up retarded. My boyfriend can‚Äôt work or the places charges us even MORE and even if we could pay it - he‚Äôs not allowed to leave me with the baby. So who can I get to supervise me while I‚Äôm with the baby? I got no family or friends that are allowed to help!

What am I supposed to do? I have nothing! I‚Äôm not allowed to be a parent, I‚Äôm not even treated like a human being! I‚Äôm around my boyfriend 24/7 because he HAS to watch me. We‚Äôre starting to not get along. We need alone time. My social worker must be trying to kill me or something because this isn‚Äôt right! You don‚Äôt do this to people!

I‚Äôve complained about her and I‚Äôm getting a new one soon but wow this has damaged me. I feel like life really isn‚Äôt worth it now. My babies won‚Äôt get to see the real me because I‚Äôm never happy anymore. Not really. I can fake it but I don‚Äôt want to lie to them.

. I‚Äôm feeling like maybe I should just end it all myself. "

0,"Old diary entries of a recovering addict
Just a bit of backround information, I'm a 27 year old who became a IV morphine addict at 16. I'm currently in recovery and sober for a year and couple weeks, I don't like to keep exact track. I just know the last time was the day I buried my dad. I also kinda dislike the term recovering addict because I just feel I will always be a addict, just hopefully a sober one. Anyways on to a diary entry.

Diary entry #1, undated, wrote when I was 17.
:""Most days I just want to die. Sometimes it seems that it would be better to be dead than to feel so much pain, stress and suffering. It srruto never stop hurting except when I have just pulled the needle out of my arm. In the back of my mind I sometimes wish that it would just kill me. Death feels so inevitable but sometimes so desired. I dream of days that I have the luck to have enough that I can just die in peace. I wish I knew the kiss of the one I've dreamed of for so long it seems. Would it save me or am I past David g. Should I feel guilty for feeling this way? O hear people say it's not worth it to use drugs, but it's the only thing keeping me breathing.""

Man, I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. Today was good. I worked out a bit and counted my calories for the day. I went over, but still on track to lose weight and that's what really matters. Her and I watched a few episodes of Dr. Who together which were largely alright. I for some reason can't remember any of them except for the last one right now which is unusual for me I feel. Oh, another one just came back. Now I just need the middle episode and I'll be set. I also bought a few steam games and played two of them. They both seem just alright so far. I think I just need to play them more. And if not, at least they were cheap. I also cancelled my gym membership finally so I won't be paying that anymore. Feels good to get rid of something useless like that. Alright, that's all for now. "

I‚Äôm writing this technically on the wrong day because I fell asleep watching Stranger Things last night. I‚Äôm not getting into this season as much as the first season (hence why i feel asleep).

Today was harder. I feel like I‚Äôm getting out of the ‚Äúsad‚Äù phase and entering the ‚Äúmiss you phase,‚Äù according to panic! at the disco. I went to the grocery store and this couple was buying tortillas for a taco party or something and they were bickering about how many they needed and I almost started crying because I missed doing stuff like shopping together so much. Even when we stopped living together, and we went long distance that stuff made me very sad. Now it‚Äôs just even worse because I‚Äôll never get to lose you in a giant store but also know exactly where you are because you always sneak off to buy the same stupid things.

I also came across some old pictures of a day before I left to move out of state. we went to the beach, and we saw a dude eating sushi in the sand. we just laid on the beach forever.

It sucks missing you, but at the same time I am still remembering why our relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect. We hadn‚Äôt been getting along, we didn‚Äôt really tell each other how we were feeling, I was using masks to repress everything I‚Äôve ever felt, and we lived 2000 miles away. There were a lot of problems, and I won‚Äôt forget those either. I mean, you slept with someone else and I definitely won‚Äôt forget that.

I still know that there are better things out there. Whether or not I want to ever pursue them, i don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been asked out twice and although I‚Äôm curious, I just can‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to anyone else. I‚Äôm just not interested, honestly. I‚Äôm interested in making friends, that‚Äôs about it. Just being in a male-dominated field as a woman sucks because all your friends are men and you can‚Äôt just sit around and watch rom coms and do your nails and gossip and they don‚Äôt make fun of you when you order martinis or some cocktail instead of beer. And there‚Äôs always one to ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with you, or more like ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù as i like to say and I‚Äôm the only woman around so. "

I forgot and I overslept. I should have verified with Her the night before. I thought about it, and then just never did. Hopefully everyone isn't too mad. I showed up late and got a few hours of work in though. After that I came home and just relaxed for a bit. I need to start packing soon. Maybe I will try and do that tomorrow. Her and I got dinner together and watched some Dr. Who. It feels so early in the evening to me and I woke up so late but I'll be damned if I'm not exhausted. Alright, that's all for now.

Alright! Time for a post about Christmas eve and Christmas. Maybe the day before then too? I am not sure. Well, a few days ago I know I just spent the whole day playing games, so that isn't too exciting. Lets see, what happened on Chritmas Eve. I think Her and I actually ended up eating Taco Bell for dinner of all things. We did exchange one Christmas present early. I gave Her a new board game which She was excited about and She got me a new funko pop for an Overwatch character I play a lot. She played a game with Her brother all that day I think and I played a few different games and watch some tv. It was a really lazy day for us. It was a good day though. I got to play smash bros with my best friend (he fucking boomed me). Christmas was fun. We exchanged the rest of our gifts and She got me a really cool merch shirt for a show I like and also a new board game that's like an escape room apparently which sounds awesome. Oh, and She also got me another new board game that we played yesterday and was a lot of fun. I got Her an expansion to a game I know She likes and also a box set of books that She likes but they are the cooler looking European versions that She has been talking about for a while. Christmas at my families was alright.  My brother was an ass, but what else is new. We actually had fun because we got to play board games and stuff. I think most everyone favorite was the last game that we played that was like a dungeon crawler rpg. I was surprised that both She and my cousin liked it. Alright, that's all for now."

i missed you today, but I‚Äôm still just thinking this isn‚Äôt going to work. The good in you has faded, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to return. Talking to others about what a jerk you are is helping. Thinking of my co-worker who has a crush on me gives me hope that something better is coming. Reminiscing with my ex before you has helped me realize that there‚Äôs a better life and love out there. You‚Äôre just not the same person that I fell in love with.

It‚Äôs Christmas, and it was lonely. I spent all day watching movies and shopping online without buying anything but pajama pants to replace the ones I left at your place - starting new. I got thai curry with my roommate which was amazing. I felt happy for her and her boyfriend finally. I just want to let this go, but I need to be in the right state of mind.

I didn‚Äôt cry today, which means there‚Äôs hope. But I did think of you all day, and even when I woke up. I just need time. I don‚Äôt want to talk to you. I want you to leave me alone, but I want to tell you that I‚Äôm not waiting for you. I deserve better.

I‚Äôve spent the last month learning about myself, and changing myself and reading books to better myself and my relationships. I deserve better than someone who cheats on their girlfriend of almost five years. I always have, and now I know it.

You can keep talking shit about me to all your friends, and keep lying to yourself about the reality. It‚Äôs take more than that to kill this bitch. "

I have long wanted to start writing my thoughts on paper.For a long time I thought about why I should have started. This is my first post supposed to be just a page of my diary.

I start today because It is one of the most important day of my life. This is the most important period of my life. I hope that writing these pages the aswers to my questions will flow between the lines.

Since I came back to home a couple of days ago It seems like everything has changed. Maybe it's just me that has changed. Here I have found my girlfriend and I'm happy. She is happy. But come back to home is never easy, I guess. For me It was easier than for her. She is been here longer than me but she still cannot go on. She wants to come back there because she fell in love with that city. But for now she have to stay here.

I have a month with her. In Febbrary my plan is to fly back. I have work to do. It's hard for me to leave. Leave everything and go. My family need me and my girlfriend needs me. But What am I supposed to do? She doesn't understand that I must go and she keeps finding something to postpone my departure as late as possible.

Now I feel like this is no more my place in the world. I know that other people have felt what I feel. This conforts me. I think that If at least my girlfriend and I could be togheter, this would be easier. Just sleep togheter and have a hug in the night. I feel alone. I feel like the world is too big for me. I don't recognize this place.

Now I know that the choices I'm doing in this moment could change completely the line of my life. I know that these choices will define who I will be in a few years."

The days keep adding up, Jesus.

Woke up early, wore my turtle neck to church. We played kingdoms for our Sunday school game, Betty lied out of stupidity and we lost because of that but it almost ended up working in the end.

We scooted the chairs in real close, only 15 of us this morning, it was kind of nice. We finished our study of Hebrews, and I even said a word or two for once.

Anneliese sat next to me in service, I always feel weird singing next to her but we‚Äôre chill. I said we should go to lunch sometime over the break and she asked if I wanted to go today. We went to the new chipotle that opened up. We talked about life, and work, and college. Then when we were almost done eating her family got there and sat down with us. Her mom is hilarious and I totally love her, but her dad still scared me a bit just because he‚Äôs an elder and so quiet. She dropped me back off home and I showed her my room.

L made a ton of cookies and we decorated cookies all afternoon, but Z and I messed around and sister-fought for a bit. I took a lot of pics to put on the personal insta. I deleted all my photos and backed them up to google last night.

I colored all the icing and helped put it in the bags, then we got to work on decorating. I made about a dozen pretty ones and then gave up and started making crappy ones. They actually tasted good unlike grandmas.

Posted my pics to insta and very soon after, F liked them. It made me so happy, I wondered if he got the ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî posted for the first time in a while‚Äù

The exact details of the rest of the day are a blur. I worked on my written diary, listened to music, made a weight loss journal, scheduled crap a bit more, whatever.

Dear Diary,

&#x200B;

First time writing one publicaly anonymously. Perhaps, this will be something I stick to more often.

I had spent the earlier parts of 2018 in much confusion, loss & wander. It has led me to the point of realization & discovery of what is truly important to me in life. Nothing else is more important to me than to make a decent living for myself so that I can support my own dreams in life. Nothing else. I used to revel myself in the perceived attention of others - thinking that that is what I truly valued when it comes easily & cheapily without much meaning. There is no power in providing something when others can't see the value. People won't see it until something happens to you. That's just how people are. Only when you die or become suddenly important that they will say ""I have been with you all along"" when truly only I myself have been with myself all along.

&#x200B;

I want to focus on work this year. 2018 has provided me with a platform for trenmendous change & transformation but 2019, I would like to make things happen & it starts right now.

0,"I want to be a cat
Cats like to drink from the toilet bowl, from a fish tank, and potteries that hold living plants, but never from their designated cups. We misunderstand cats by saying they‚Äôre refusing to adapt to the habit of their human slaves.

In this, we might be totally wrong.

Wait for the fish to die out, remove the plants from the potteries, fill his cup with running water and make sure that he sees it, he would stop his naughty mischiefs and do as we wish.

So the cat is in fact a very romantic kind of creature ‚Äî naturally drawn to living or moving bodies. We humans are rigid and bleak in imagination ‚Äî we are good at following rules but bad at designing meaningful ones.

I often dreamed of you turning into a cat to live with me. But of course, eventually you have to abandon me after a few unhappy arguments. I did not understand you and your way of reasoning appeared absurd. I was angry at your messed-up logic and you were outrageous with my not even trying from your angle. The parting was for our mutual benefit. We both were satisfied.

When you were a cat, you liked to scratch my good sofa. I had to exaggerate my anger at you to establish the right behavioral structure, so that you know it was bad and not allowed around this household. But it never stopped you.

Cos you are a cat, you enjoyed the excitement of being caught and running away from the punishment.

Today, I‚Äôd give everything to have you back, even when it means you are destroying all my furniture.

But to this, you answered no, for a reason that I can never understand.

After all, I am not a cat."

I woke up at noon (again), because I can‚Äôt fall asleep until late because of the anxiety. I spent all day doing basically nothing, just reading and walking the dog. I was happy with things and us.

the more i think about this the more i‚Äôm just angry. you‚Äôre such a fucking asshole. honestly how dare you keep talking to this woman and me at the same time. i know you might think you‚Äôre ‚Äújust friends‚Äù but what the fuck dude. i can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself. i need to let go. i just want to rip this bandaid off because fuck you for continuing to treat me like shit."

Its almost Christmas and I have plans with the people I love, but the stress from unemployment is killing me. I'm dreading the questions that'll come later too.... The interview I had yesterday was one of the worst, honestly. I don't know how much longer I can do this cycle of interviews and rejections. I pray and pray but nothing still...."

I think I just have two of these to do? Not sure. Today I had some anxiety but I feel like I have mostly gotten over it, still a bit though. I am tired. Her and I saw Aquaman today which started off really bad but actually got better about half way in. I also worked this morning which wasn't bad, other people were saying how busy it was but it seemed slow if anything to me. I don't really know what I have done since I got home. Haven't play anything or watched anything really, waste of time. I need to go to bed. Lets see, what did I do yesterday. Oh, I had training, right? I believe so. I also got paid for my driving as well which feels great! No clue what I did yesterday after that though! Alright, that's all for now."

I wore my pajamas to school today. I was exhausted and I had given up. I wanted to look tired, and this is how I did it.

When I got to school the cafeteria tables were folded up and shit, there was spot on my usual spot to sit. I‚Äôm not sure F noticed me walk over there then turn around and wander for a second or two and then leave.

I went back into the hall and into F‚Äôs room before my final. M and H were inside. H was teaching M how to play poker. I worked on my final and looked dead as fuck. D kept talking and talking so I put in my headphones and blasted some Soledad Brothers‚Äî loud enough someone near me could hear if the room was quiet. Maybe F heard? I don‚Äôt know. He never really talked to me directly the whole time.

When I finished my final, H taught me how to play poker too. I was starting to get the hang of it then D joined in as well.
I‚Äôm gonna miss art portfolio over break so much. But I‚Äôm super super excited about next semester and having two classes with F!

Meteorology final went alright too. It was way easier than I expected and it might even raise my grade!

Went to rbchina for lunch for the first time. We ate it at home. Dad threw up from the chicken but it wasn‚Äôt the restaurants fault. He‚Äôs been throwing up every time he eats chicken or milk for the last few months. My food was really good and I‚Äôm sure we will go back.

I worked on my written diary a bit. Then I cleaned off my desk and printed a bunch of my blocks in gold ink on black paper, and some small black ones on white. I clipped them to string and made it look cool and posted a pic to my insta.

After that I went to work. Someone brought Joann a bunch of Hershey Kisses.

I finished cleaning my room when I got home and cleaned for a long time. I got kind of bored and decided to cut my legs. Which was sick of me to do, but I just felt like I was feeling too okay and I didn‚Äôt want to stop. I got a pencil sharpener from the basement and the blade was super sharp, the sharpest yet. I cut pretty deep, I could see the top of the dermis. It bled a lot and I washed it off in the bathroom.

I cleaned some more after that and made a schedule/calendar thingy for winter break.

Now it‚Äôs 10:24 and I‚Äôm exhausted as hell. I need to sleep bad.

Woke up early planning on studying for my English final, and didn‚Äôt. Barely got ready in time like usual. Wore my new red button up shirt and blue jeans and sandals with the gold star earrings. Felt pretty good looking again this morning.

I downloaded ep. 108 of HBM and listened to it on the bus to when I arrived at school. Snuck into F‚Äôs room and took pictures of my screen prints that were drying from yesterday. Put my coat and portfolio in my locker and went to the cafeteria.

My usual table was folded up so I sat at the circle table instead still in F‚Äôs line of sight. I pulled out ECGTB and started reading it but secret enough as for him not to realize I was reading it, but at the same time enough he could see that I was secretly wanting him to see I was secretly reading it. He didn‚Äôt see me I don‚Äôt think.

My English final was mediocre. I felt like I did good on the essay portion though. Ms. S kept looking at me weird when she saw I was reading... god forbid.. a book!

Got caught up on some South Park during 5th hr. And worked on my portfolio slideshow.

Went to lunch thinking it was time for lunch but I realized I still had to wait another hour and I walked into to AP after the bell. F looked stressed as hell which makes me stressed as hell and everyone else stressed and off kilter as well. After a minute F declared that he wasn‚Äôt going to do critiques today because half of everyone was gone and everyone just didn‚Äôt make their presentation, and the projector wasn‚Äôt working. I felt bad for him though, he gives people a lot of time to do things and they still can‚Äôt seem to do it on time.

After a while I just got tired and decided to take a nap kinda. I propped my bag up on my table and used my arms as pillows. It was a combination of stress, I wasn‚Äôt really tired, just depressed and stressed. I kept tearing up thinking about mom and shit and winter break and not being to see F or anyone else and I just was having a hard time. I left to the bathroom twice and I definitely think F noticed something was up. Maybe this was my chance?

I think once early on in class he walked by and said something quick like ‚Äúyou okay‚Äù or ‚Äútired huh?‚Äù I replied something about just being tired.

Mission success on him seeing my pain but mission failure in owning up to it and telling the truth.

Went to 7th hour and only half of our small class was there. Alex came in and we vented about being pissed over the portfolio rescheduling and crap. The class was kind of fun being so small. I drew a creepy creature on a notecard and put it on the board, even drew a ‚ÄúMr. Beanwell.‚Äù

I snuck into F‚Äôs room. No one was there so I figured he was in the dark room, I was right. I re-taped my screen a bit tighter on my own. I worked pretty quickly, skillfully, and quietly. After he came out of the dark room, and I explained what I was doing, he asked if I was doing alright, and I said yeah. Just fucking yeah. F mentioned something about the books he had recommended and admitted he didn‚Äôt remember much about ECGTB but he just likes the way the book made him feel. I agreed. He said I was a quick reader when I mentioned reading about half of it already.

I worked for quite a bit in silence but I was really working. I just reprinted my screen in green. After a while Mrs. H came in to talk about something or another class related. I wasn‚Äôt paying super close attention I was too busy cleaning out my screens and crap. When I was cleaning up we talked briefly about something or another, probably screen printing related. He asked if I wanted some blank spiral that had been in the class for ages, I said why not.

I said bye and I went out to sit in my spot on the stairs and it was hella windy and cold out, I almost blew away. I sat holding myself trying to stay warm. F drove by and smiled bye.

I got home and started cleaning my room a bit. I didn‚Äôt quite finish. I started cleaning and organizing my desk and shelf again and when I was around halfway done we left to get Freddy‚Äôs for dinner.

When I came back I organized a bit more and then got the wild idea to write all my diary entries since I started on the 3rd in the spiral, and keep my diary in a spiral because I share way too much personal shit on the internet. Also, keeping journals secret and hidden are way more fun, plus they look beautiful and are a real accomplishment when fully completed.

I started writing entries, I got maybe 3 1/2 done before it got too late and I took a shower and wrote this and am going to bed.

I hope tomorrow goes okay. I know that no matter what the hell F does or says whether great or okay, doesn‚Äôt matter because I have a lot of fun personal time to look forward to over the break. Reading all those entries were hard and weird and I don‚Äôt want to think about it that much now. Night stupid diary and the whole fucking internet."

today, was actually a really good day.

we drove from my dads to my moms in the morning. I forgot about my therapy session and ended up quitting, but I‚Äôll be going to in-person sessions because I haven‚Äôt really liked the online thing. I went grocery shopping with my mom and she cooked a glorious vegan meal for Christmas dinner. we even exchanged some gifts and she gave me socks and my brother bought me a huge box of vegan snacks which i will devour on the plane back to school.

we talked a lot, like normal. you said you couldn‚Äôt be with me right now because you are not yourself and very depressed. I understand, but like i said, i‚Äôm with you through the good and the bad. this is a super bad time for us and for you personally, but i never stopped loving you. I am hurt by what happened, but you‚Äôre the one i want for the rest of my days. whether or not we get married. whether or not we have kids. i just want to spend my free time next to you. we need to work harder on our relationship, and i know we will. this has opened so many lines of communication and i am grateful for that. we‚Äôve already started talking about potentially moving in together when i graduate again. i can‚Äôt wait. I miss you so much it physically hurts. but you need space and i understand that.

you are the absolute love of my life and i am not giving up on you yet. please be kind to yourself and i will always be here. "

two weeks, it doesn‚Äôt feel real.

today i am questioning everything.

i‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs best for us to part ways so we can grow apart. I think that might be good for you, but i feel like i have been allowing myself to grow outside of the relationship for a long time. i mean, i‚Äôve had jobs and am in grad school and on track for my dream career. i am happy in my personal life. but you aren‚Äôt. you don‚Äôt know what you want to do, what job you‚Äôre going to have. maybe you need time. i‚Äôm just afraid that you‚Äôll move on without me. i can‚Äôt fathom the thought of you with anyone else. i almost feel like it‚Äôs a little manipulative and wrong. if i love him, i should let him go. and if it is meant to be we will end of together. i should trust that.

i want to be friends, though. i mean I‚Äôm an INTJ and although i go out occasionally and talk to other people, you were my best friend. i don‚Äôt want to lose that. but i can‚Äôt sit idly by if you‚Äôre going to start moving on.

i also am hurt though because you won‚Äôt tell your friends about us sleeping together. are you ashamed? you know this isn‚Äôt going to happen and were just using me? i don‚Äôt know, but honestly it kinda sucks.

evening thoughts.

I can‚Äôt sleep. I told your mom about your depression and it feels weird. I feel bad, but I didn‚Äôt feel right before either. you may be very mad at me. but that‚Äôs okay. I really think that I needed to do this. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll talk to me again. I feel crazy - like i can‚Äôt stop thinking about you and keep trying to do things that maybe aren‚Äôt helpful. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I miss you "

A very long day but in retrospect was very bland.

Woke up early to cut my bangs. Never cut ‚Äòem this short before. I‚Äôm not sure I like it or not. I enjoy the freedom but I feel a bit self conscious about them being so short.

Wore my green Rocky Mountain T-shirt and the better fitting black jeans with my sandals. Felt pretty good looking today with my new haircut.

I posted on my story asking for book recommendations for some winter break reading.

Did the usual morning routine, except this time, Justin, the weird muscly sophomore with a limited sensibility of social cues came over and sat down in front of me. I accidentally made eye contact with him and I guess he took that as an invite to sit with me. So much for being sad and depressed about my dead mom in front of F.

I made as polite conversation as I could. He came to art club meetings occasionally so I was particularly nice. He has no talent but he has a drive unparalleled to me.

I left to go to take my algebra final. F posted something in the art portfolio chat about our critiques for tomorrow.

The algebra final sucked big time. I ended up getting a 53% on it. I barely kept my C with a 69.80% in the class. Glad that craps over with.

Went to our last creative writing class of the year. I‚Äôm really sad, although I had a bitter-sweet relationship with that class. We had snacks and we had a good ole time writing. I wrote compliments to Molly and Emery they weren‚Äôt very good but I tried. At the end I started getting really sad. I love being in Mrs. A‚Äôs room. Guess I‚Äôll actually have to start going to FRLNCR meetings now. I got three amazing compliment notes, one from ray, one from Mrs. A, and I forget the other one. Rays was really beautiful and funny and I didn‚Äôt know she thought that way about me. I guess people are all good in the heart, just sometimes appearances and behaviors paint a more wild and rude picture.
Mrs. A suggested cadet teaching (kind of) to me and Lucia. We both got super excited about the idea of being cadet teachers next year. I‚Äôm really going to miss that class and I‚Äôm thankful for how much more in touch I‚Äôve become with my writing.

(Somewhere around 11:30, F replied to my story inquiring about books and suggested, ‚ÄúEven cowgirls get the blues, and jitterbug perfume.‚Äù)

Skipped lunch. Wasn‚Äôt very hungry after snacks and I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to deal with the hell that is 1st lunch. Snuck into Mrs. H‚Äôs room and stole her iPad Pro to work on my social commentary art project. She had a sub that hour and was very confused when I got up and left when 1st lunch was over.

I worked on my drawing on the iPad all of 4th hour review. It looks pretty damn good and I‚Äôm happy with it.

Ditto 5th hour review, I just worked on my drawing and printed out a few test versions.

After school was over I went down to F‚Äôs room to ask for help making a screen-print. I stumbled over my words when asking him if he‚Äôd help me make a screen. Liza and that kid Justin was there for a majority of the time after school. He helped me right away and I felt nervous showing him my drawing. He didn‚Äôt say anything, but he usually does that. Doesn‚Äôt questions things, just silently judges.

It was nice just being in the room with him. Talking to him, even if we weren‚Äôt alone. I was kind of glad we weren‚Äôt alone too. We talked a bit about college and what Ellie thought of it with Liza. F started going on about the college experience and how great living in a dorm/apartment on campus is and how nice it is to be so close to your studio space. I completely, 100% agreed, but I just had to say, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a lot cheaper to live at home.‚Äù I feel so guilty having all these financial restrictions. I don‚Äôt think he had those growing up, I bet his parents are pretty loaded‚Äî or he married rich.

I feel awkward if I‚Äôm not super charismatic me, or super sad and depressed me around him. I hate the in between.

The first time we printed the screen, it didn‚Äôt work and we couldn‚Äôt figure out why. I got him to cut me a new piece of screen so we could try again, and it worked. He was feeding it in the wrong way. He said we‚Äôre getting professional screen printing equipment for next semester. I‚Äôm excited, the art rooms going to look like a sweatshop pretty soon.

I had some problems printing my screen. But I got to work with him one on one doing it. He helped tape up one side while I taped the other, he held down the screen when I would pull the ink through. We were a good team.

I feel this weird tension though. I feel like he wants to kind of be my friend? If that‚Äôs even the right word. More like favorite student (if that‚Äôs not too self centered of me to say?) I don‚Äôt know... But I feel like there‚Äôs this awkwardness too. It‚Äôs hard to explain, I‚Äôm definitely just overthinking things.

I left and thanked him for all the help, I really meant it. I took down my things from the display case so I could photograph them tonight. On his way out he said bye. He said he was going to look at Christmas lights tonight.

I went and sat in the freezing cold in my normal spot and he waved bye. He‚Äôs just the best person ever. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through break without him and my friends when I can‚Äôt even make it through the weekend without breaking down and crying/cutting myself like the little emo child I am.

I went to the 5$ store with dad to get Z some Christmas presents right after school. I got her some nail polish, some makeup wipes, and some pocky sticks.

I got home, heated up some brisket, wrapped her presents, looked at the presents already under the tree. I have 2 and Z has like 5. When L got home I convinced her to take me to the library after dinner.

We did. I was able to get ‚ÄúEven cowgirls get the blues‚Äù and in a panic because none of the other suggested books were available, ‚Äúon the road.‚Äù

I got home, made some hot chocolate and set it in my room so I could take a piss real quick and I noticed F was online on insta. I wiped and got back to my room faster than a rabbit and posted to my story a thank you for everyone who suggested the books. By the time I‚Äôd posted it, F went offline and I deleted the post before anyone saw and re-wrote it all pretty and aesthetically tagging F and Milla and Alex and Claire.

F replied,
‚ÄúEven Cowgirls Get the Blues blew my mind when I first read it. I was probably 19. It‚Äôs about a bunch of women but it still made me feel empowered and  inspired. Tom Robbins is awesome. Skinny Legs And All is his other one I love. Happy reading.‚Äù

And I said ‚ÄúThank You!!‚Äù

He said, ‚ÄúMy pleasure.‚Äù

So around two hours ago I started reading. I really like the book so far and I can‚Äôt wait to see where it takes me. I have a half mind to finish half the book tonight, or even the whole. But even I don‚Äôt have that patience anymore.

I really miss reading. It had such a positive impact on my life as a kid. I remember the excitement books brought me. I miss being able to read an 800 page Harry Potter book in one day.

I haven‚Äôt read anything on my own in a long time. I don‚Äôt know if this counts as ‚Äúon my own‚Äù considering I‚Äôm really only doing it to please F, but I‚Äôm glad I am. It‚Äôs a good book.

Took me almost an hour to write this because I was so detailed and got distracted a few dozen different times. I‚Äôm going to read more of the book now, or maybe hop in the shower to wash off the grossness. Anyways, goodnight dumbass reddit diary."

Alright, time for a quick few posts. I know I didn't post today yet or yesterday so lets start there. Yesterday was alright, I met up with people pretty early in the day and got some studying done before our exam. I think meeting up with people wasn't the most helpful thing but I did get some stuff  I def needed for the exam from it. I also think that exam went really well. Had some troubles with bad thoughts both yesterday and today, but I got over them which is good. I studied a lot for my exam that I had today too because I was worried the most about it out of all my exams and I feel like it ended up being easier than I thought it would be (but idk). Work was fine. I might end up having a really nice schedule next semester for work, I will just have to wait and see how it pans out I suppose. Her and I went to the mall so She could study when I got back and I got Chipotle for dinner which I shouldn't have. I also played a bit of smash bros with Her before bed which was cool (even though I am sooooo bad uggh). Alright, that's all for now. Day off tomorrow, woohoo!"

Woke up with my hue lamp. It always helps me wake up more peacefully. I really am glad I have it. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been feeling better today. I may do a test sometime in the future.

I wore my big maroon shirt, the long black jeans, my pizza socks and sandals and my denim jacket. I know the jacket makes me look huge but I feel protected in it.

When getting ready I got a reply to my Instagram story about my mom from F.
Just a ‚Äú‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù

He fucking knows now. I did it, is this what I‚Äôve wanted? Why don‚Äôt I feel ecstatic or sad? I don‚Äôt know if he read it carefully or just skimmed and put replied with a heart. But either way, he saw. He even replied. I feel less alone now. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs connected the dots with my zines and my personal narrative project and shit but he knows now. And I‚Äôm glad.

I sat in the cafeteria like normal and did a pretty damn good job of looking depressed. Athena came over for two minutes to chat and then she left. I don‚Äôt think F saw me but I hope he did. I couldn‚Äôt face him after what I posted and shit.

I went to 1st hour and worked on a to do list and the boys basketball poster. It started to really take shape 2nd hour. Today was a weird schedule because we had our first Final today. We had a 1st, 2nd and 3rd hour review then lunch then our 1st hour final. I finished the basketball poster during lunch with Alex D and L and G. I hope they like it.

I studied for my 20‚Äôs test in 3rd hour. I was sure to memorize everything almost word for word.
The final was super easy. I was the third person finished and I‚Äôm sure I got a 100%. We watched an episode of the office for the rest of class. The one where Pam walks on the coals.

M told me to meet her in the counseling hallway because she had to bring me something so I‚Äôm like fuck yeah and took the pass and snuck up to the next floor hallway waiting for her. The halls were ghostly because everyone was taking their finals. She didn‚Äôt appear so I went to the bathroom to avoid being asked what I was doing. She said to meet her there after the bell.
So I did.

I came back and she came from the 5th floor with H and was holding a wrapped present! I was so shook that she‚Äôd do something so thoughtful when we barely saw each other. I held onto it for a while and we talked about Christmas presents for a minute. Finally I was like, should I open it? And I did. It was kind of awkward but it was fun. She got me this big book about this Dutch painter. She said the paintings reminded her of some of my art which I can‚Äôt see even remotely how but I thanked her and gave her a hug.

My only problem is the painting on the jacket of the book is of half naked women and there‚Äôs a lot of butts. At least its artistic?? I just can‚Äôt you know, read it in my living room without my sister pointing out the fact that the book has some backs of naked women on it. Still, I absolutely love it and plan on reading it over break.

I ran down to the bus and went home. I thanked M on my public story and shit. She‚Äôs so fucking nice what the hell I still feel like an idiot around her.

I got home and took a package for Z inside and dad said he‚Äôd put presents under the tree. I was surprised. I think I‚Äôll look whenever I make it through this chaotic week.

Almost was late leaving for work because my hair wouldn‚Äôt stay in a bun. Work was pretty average. I like talking to Alex there, I‚Äôm glad I got her to work there with me. She brought me the cookies I bought from her, finally.

Came home and sat at the dinner table avoiding doing homework for an hour. I need to finish my independent project and have some sketches for my art project.

I took a shower and cut four small cuts in my leg just because I was bored and wanted to watch it bleed. It stung in the shower and it bled really nicely with the water. I about gave myself shock when I tried to rinse my hair with freezing cold water.

I came back to my room. F saw the rest of my public insta story about random shit. Then I started writing today‚Äôs entry.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through winter break without him or my friends or even my church friends. I‚Äôm excited for Christmas though. I hope I get those new shoes and I hope that I get those earrings! I‚Äôm so excited aaaa! But I‚Äôm kinda stressed too. Gonna wake up early to cut my bangs real short and study for my algebra final.

I fucking love sleeping though."

Did some networking found some older man who says he can get me a job I want if I sleep with him. I don't see why not says for me to put the application in and contact him when it's done and he will make arrangements to meet with me.

That's the plan for now I'll be working at some new place in the meantime I guess. My main clients are not available at the moment because of the holidays so it should help.

You know I have realized something very important that I should have a long time ago. Id say more but my services raked in what they could today going to bed now.

Hi. It's been a month since I last updated. In my last post I mentioned that there was a mass found in my uterus.

After that, I had an MRI done and two more ultrasounds done. I met my gynecologist today (2nd meeting) and I gave him the results from my examinations.

I have two cysts - one 10cm fibroid cyst in my uterus (but it likes to move around if I sleep a certain way) and an 8cm dermoid cyst in one of my ovaries.

Those cysts were causing me issues and pain for months. The weight and pressure of the bigger cyst was weighing down my uterus and it was causing me pelvic pain.

I had mistaken the pains to be urinary tract infections for a few months because it feels very similar and the similarities were: pain where I pee, tightness in the pelvic area, urinary incontinence (no control over keeping pee in, leaking on the underwear), and urinary frequency (peeing many times and the feel of needing to pee even when there's no urine).

I had corrected this by doing my own physical therapy, which was doing exercises I found off youtube that best worked for me. I stuck to one thing and kept at it every night and day and it took about 3 months to finally get the pain to go away. Sometimes it hurts but not badly.

Anyway back to the gynecologist. He told me the dermoid cyst replaced my left ovary and should the cyst by removed, so will my ovary. Due to the size of dermoid cyst, surgical excision is the only possible way to safely get rid of it. He said I could also leave it alone and do another ultrasound and see if it gets bigger. But it causes me pain in my side so I am opting to get rid of it.

It's a huge thing to me because I don't want to lose my ovary. I'm sad that I'll have a harder chance to conceive, but it's better to still be able to than to have a hysterectomy and have none at all. It's so ironic because I thought I'd be okay without children and didn't plan on having any, but the thought of having that chance in case I do change my mind taken away... well it's sad. At least 1 ovary will remain.

Why does the female body have to be so stupid and complicated?

This past month I also didn't know if I had cancer or not, but the good news is that I don't have cancer. It's the best news out of all of this.

I also have more of a support network now and people have been really kind to me and I appreciate it so much. I can't count how many times I've cried because of my health issues, not knowing what was going on, being brushed off, ignored, not taken seriously, thinking I was alone, dealing with the pain, dealing with the drop in work ethic because of my issues, news after news... it really impacted my quality of life in different ways. It's such a relief that this is just a hurdle I will live through.

I am not the same me I was a year ago. Next year I will be me with additional scarring and minus an ovary, but alive. I am hopeful things will look up after that."
0,"RESET DAY 21: OTHER PEOPLE
Uuugh 17 days.

I've known for a while but I really dislike living with other people. They're so... Annoying. Like 1 I didn't ask for your shit so 2 don't ask me to take care of them. Like I've made it pretty obvious I hate those little shits.


Anywho that put me in a bad mood so I might try and self harm tonight or tomorrow. Probably not going to be able to but at least I'll try lol. I also got tegaderm which is suppose to be good for Burns so that's a good thing I guess. I got it for my tattoo because it HELPS SO MUCH. Like in a week it was basically healed and ready to go. The bruising was terrible but it went away after 3 or 4 days.

I wanna hurt myself. Like the release of endorphins is amazing and would be perfect right now. I'd feeling like nothing matters and fall asleep like a baby???"

Was too tired/busy to post a diary entry over the weekend. Nothing particularly exciting happened except for me breaking down Sunday afternoon because F ended a sentence with a period. I‚Äôm a loser. I also got 100$ worth of printmaking supplies I plan to go to town on during winter break.

‚Äî-

I woke up this morning late and barely got ready in time. I wore my blue sweater black jeans and boots. I still need to get my laundry from the basement.

As I was sitting by the door waiting for it to be 7:03 to leave, dad came in and was like ‚Äúyou jammin out?‚Äù Seeing my earbuds. He said ‚Äúlistening to some John MacArthur?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply but gave a nervous sarcastic laugh. I think he knows that I listen to music but I don‚Äôt know to what extent.

Put my coat in my locker and Mrs. H said ‚Äúso no pizza socks today?‚Äù Sarcastically. I laughed and said something dumb back and went to the cafeteria to my usual spot. I don‚Äôt think F noticed me. J came over and talked to me like usual and she always is saying how she has no friends at school right in front of me to my face. I mean we‚Äôre not really friends but what an asshole thing to say. I wish she‚Äôd leave me alone in the mornings I just want to sit by myself and cry.

I went to history and wrote the next half of my Independent project which was due 3rd hour. I did the same thing in math. In math I got an email from Mrs. HR to do the boys basketball poster. I started on it and worked on cropping the players during presentations third hour. Mrs. A made really good sugar cookies for us.

I presented and was really nervous and couldn‚Äôt talk for most of my presentation until I started reading the excerpt. When I got to my writing it felt so natural and beautiful even though my voice was a little shaky.
I was happy with it in the end but I was a bit mad at myself for being so nervous.

4th and 5th hour I continued working on the basketball poster. In 5th I talked to Z about college and shit. I feel so obnoxious when I talk about it. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve convinced myself so much so if the fantasy of college that I‚Äôll be completely devastated if I don‚Äôt go the way I want to.

I went to lunch and waited for F but he never came into the cafeteria to my knowledge. I ate quickly and sat outside of his room.

art portfolio was pretty weird. F told us about our due dates and said he‚Äôd post the final tonight. I never talked to him once the whole hour. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do without him over the break. Two weeks without F. I don‚Äôt think I can do it.
Log talked about birds and I started missing by birds bad. I started like full on crying and it was bad. I don‚Äôt know if F noticed or not. I even miss Louie. Fuck, ugh I miss them so much what the hell I wish my dad allowed pets.
I wanted to go cut myself so bad and then I remembered I don‚Äôt even have my fucking blades.

7th hour was boring as shit except that Alex came in and we talked and she said that Ellie was there visiting and saying hi. I wanted to go say hi but I didn‚Äôt want to go to F‚Äôs room just to say hi.

I messaged the zine club group me to see if we were meeting because I desperately wanted to hang out in F‚Äôs room after school.
F replied ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Aug canceled.
I saw Ellie briefly in the hallways and said hi for a sec.

I went to F‚Äôs room and chatted with M and R and H for a couple minutes. I‚Äôm so excited to have 7th hour with them!!!! I love them so much they are so great! I sat down and decided I‚Äôd get to work on folding my big stack of zines. F was busy with the other Alex and crew.

Out of nowhere Log comes back from the bathroom and hands me the pencil pouch Mrs. Bro gave to me last year that I‚Äôd lost. I was dumbfounded and couldn‚Äôt believe it was in there. How long had it been in there??? I haven‚Äôt seen it since last year! It‚Äôs a fucking mystery I tell you. I was glad to see it, and I miss Mrs.Bro too.

F had to go take a phone call and was gone for 20 to 30 minutes. I was alone with Audrey and I kept folding all my zines and I talked to her about her printing she was doing.

When she left and F came back from his call there were only like 5 minutes before he had to leave. I started packing up my crap and he asked me if I was stressed about finals. I said not really and that I was more stressed by the other assignments I had to get done that weren‚Äôt finals. He agreed and started talking about how his generation and older generations didn‚Äôt give a shit about finals and weren‚Äôt so worried all the time about the future and college and stuff. He made some really good points and I completely agreed. It was kind of a rant and it was nice to have him actually talk to me. He makes me so happy I can‚Äôt even fully describe it.
He said that someone had to look out and stick up for the teenagers and it was really sweet.

As I was heading out the door he said ‚Äúsorry I didn‚Äôt mean to go on a rant!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye S‚Äî‚Äî!‚Äù
And I said oh no you‚Äôre fine all weird and said bye back. He‚Äôs so fucking nice I love him so much he‚Äôs the best person in the whole world.

I went and sat on the stairs in my coat waiting for dad and he drove by and he just smiled so big it made every ounce of me feel pure joy. He is fucking magical.

I went straight to work right after dad picked me up and I went and did my etraining and tests. The tests were hard at first and I talked to D a bit in the office. They got super busy when I needed to ask AD something so I left and said I‚Äôd be working tomorrow and could figure it out.

I came home and now I‚Äôm writing this.
I wanna get to work on some stuff. I might update this later, I just wanted to get this out of the way before I forgot for a third day in a row.


EDIT: yeah I did try to get stuff done when I realized I still had all of moms old text conversations on my iPad. I thought they were gone forever. I had s big breakdown and cried a lot. Something broke in me and I was sick of letting mom fade into the past and I want people to fucking know what I deal with every day and I posted about it to my close friends insta story. I took it down and rewrote some shit about how I miss her and how you should tell your parents you love them more than they tell you. "

Today went by pretty fast I feel. I did a good amount of preping for my exam tomorrow which makes me feel a bit better about it. Going to study a bit more tomorrow before the test of course. I am more worried for my last final on Tuesday though than I am for the one tomorrow. I will be so close to being able to 4.0 my first semester. I can do it, I just got to buckle down and finish strong, I can do that. I had some bad thoughts a bit while studying but I did my best to ride them out and they went away by and large eventually. I didn't play any games today that I remember although I should have. I ended up still wasting a good bit of time doing stuff that wasn't even all that fun. I am going to shower and sleep.

A quick post for last night. Just going to type something up. Yesterday went pretty well I feel. I went to work which felt like a long shift for some reason, but I also felt like I had a ton of time in the afternoon to do fun stuff. I ended up playing a lot of smash bros and splatoon which I liked. I don't know how to play smash bros though and that was frustrating me :p I also watched some UFC fights last night which were good. The last FOX card, the end of an era. I can't believe that was 7 years ago. Where does the time go? I  don't recall having much issues with anxiety yesterday. Alright, that's all for now."

You know, I don't want much in life. Just the simple sappy things. Caring husband, a kid or two, definitely about 3 dogs...

But what I want right now: I want to be in someone's arms. HIS arms, to be exact. I want to feel safe and loved and cared about. I want to be able to reach up and kiss whenever I want. I want to fall asleep to his snores. I want to wake up on Christmas to him smiling at me. I love his smile, even though he hates his. I want to look him in the eyes and tell him how I feel. That I dont remember the last time I've felt this longing in my chest, the crushing weight of him missing. I want to feel his hand on my face, tracing my cheek with his thumb... I want to dress up and have him in complete awe and we dance the night away. I want him on bad days, good days, to be the one he finds comfort in as I do in him.

Most of all, I want to tell him all this...

...and for him to say it back."

So what am I now? You don't want to tell me about what's going on in your life knowing damn well in that handsome head of yours that I want to know everything.

Why should I give a shit or ask if all the conversation would be is an interview? Why would I do that to myself? And it's not like you give a shit about me, don't lie, it's insulting.

&#x200B;

I feel so irrelevant. Like when I first met you I wasn't in the greatest place. Then you came along and took my hand and what a whirlwind it was, showing me there's so much to life, making me feel so loved like never ever before. And now that you've left me, I've started feel more and more like I'm back in the same place. Only this time I'm alone to help myself. It's fine. I'll figure it out. I always do.

But that doesn't make any of this okay. Yes I broke promises but nothing like the ones you broke when you told me this could never work out.

The one that no one will have, that no one wants. That's how I feel. Something tells me even if ""I find someone else"" that this feeling won't go away ever-- or for a long, long, long, time. So thanks for that. Thanks for all you taught me, genuinely, but also for leaving me with lifelong pain. At least I now know what it means to love, unconditionally. Maybe I know what to look for in the future, right?

&#x200B;

This whole thing will never go away, as much as I want it to you. Maybe you can live with the satisfaction of that. Of knowing just how much you once meant to me. And no matter how utterly betrayed I feel, a trace of that will always remain. "

I don't feel good about the holidays, I just feel like shit. And on top of everything I feel like I don't have anyone to just rant to about it, so I guess that's why I'm posting here.

&#x200B;

When I first moved in I never even unpacked the 3rd room, because it became the catchall for everything that wasn't ready yet. I gutted my kitchen earlier in the year and now I can't even walk into that room. Worst yet there's so much overflow it has ruined my livingroom and other rooms as well. I don't have time to keep up with basic housecleaning because there is always some extensive project going on, or flatout nowhere to put things while construction is ongoing.

&#x200B;

Well this was supposed to change last month. From the very first of the month I started a countdown to thanksigiving. A 5 day weekend. The kitchen is almost done and I needed those 5 days to make some serious headway without being exhausted from my actual fulltime job. We were gearing up to start decorating at work too. Everything was falling into place.

But then I got deathly sick 2 days before. I had to use PTO I was saving for vacation, on a week where I already almost had every day off because of shit timing.

And then it all went wrong, because I spent the next TWO WEEKS entirely bedridden. It was so bad I actually lost 10 pounds from it. Every day I woke up I kept hoping I'd have the energy, but it just didn't happen. And just like that, my longest home vacation of the year was obliterated by a damn cold.

&#x200B;

After those two weeks, I was completely demoralized. Everyone at work had already done their decorating and now instead of partaking in festivities and enjoying myself, I was working to catchup. I reached a point where I wasn't even going to bother decorating, but then I started getting jokingly insulted at work for being so far behind everyone on the decorations. I brought stuff in, but it was no longer out of seasonal joy, but something I felt pressured to do.


Oh and I found a baby kitten that week I was sick as well. Which added more problems at home, having to gate off sections of my house, parent the pre-existing cat who has turned into the largest brat, and pay for a bunch of vet appointments to get everything koscher with the baby.


Oh and on top of all of this, I've had the fortune of dealing with sales juggling. The sole of my winter boots fell off, so I needed a new pair. It wasn't a big deal, until it was. I thought I could buy a replacement pair on blackfriday. I thought I was being smart by buying a size up, in case the first one didn't fit, so I'd still get the sale price on whichever one I ended up keeping. But then the boot looked nothing like the photos, and I had to return both. Not so bad. at least there's cyber monday? This time I decided to order the same exact boot I had before, same size and everything. First order goes in aaaand... the very next day they send me a 30% off coupon. Well screw you large company who shall not be name dropped, I am damnwell going to re-order my boots for the extra 30% off. Btw, my first order arrived in 3 days. My next 2 orders took over 2 weeks to arrive. You know, when the sales are long finished? And even though I ordered the same boots I had previously, in the same size I had previously... guess what. THEY DON'T FIT. Oh and when I went to return the more expensive pair? They refunded me for the CHEAPER pair. I had to go back just to get it corrected, because even though I was basing off the printed receipt in the box, the QR code on the outside of the box didn't match. Fuck you big retailer, fuck you.

&#x200B;

At home, I've managed to finally catch up on things. But I don't feel good about it. I have my christmas shopping done, but I don't feel relief. On the night I was getting stuff ready to bring into work, I managed to somehow clearout the livingroom enough to put up my own decorations. It felt good for a whole minute but of fucking course there is shit everywhere not even a week later. There's bags and boxes everywhere, some from returns, some from just living and not having time to clean up after myself, some from the ongoing construction, etc. I just don't have time for this. I was supposed to be done 2 weeks ago, but then I got sick. Now the big finish to the project is overlapping with christmas and it's a nightmare. I can't relax, I can't unwind, I can't even enjoy decorations because it's surrounded by a mess. Feels like my boyfriend and I are drifting apart, when this is the very same holiday that solidified our relationship after we first met last year. I don't want to have to go to family's houses. I don't want to have to commit time from my schedule to accomodate these traditions right now. I am too swamped. I just feel like absolute shit. And I want it done. I want to be able to clean. I shouldnt have to choose between christmas and painting, but here it fucking is, all because of that goddamn cold. I was in the holiday mood before I got sick, but this was a setback I could not afford, and now I am paying the price.

Is this text here just optional? That's weird. Today was pretty good. Had some bad thoughts earlier but all is fine and well now at the end of the day. Had an exam today that went really well I felt. I also worked and made a bit of money which is always good. I am soooo tired though, I have been since the afternoon. I tried to close my eyes a bit before work even. Her and I watched a good bit of Dr. Who today which was ok. I feel like the episode we watched is a big deal but it didn't impact me a ton because I haven't seen all of the previous doctors.  I also am quite far in my next book now and could finish it tomorrow if I wanted to. Depending on what I do at work I just might try and do it then? During the morning? Not a bad idea at all actually. Well, that's all for now. Time for sleep."

Jesus, time is flying fast.
My life has become a repetitive blur,
it just repeats itself over and over and over and over until I have a mental breakdown and restart the cycle.

I feel like the only way to break it is to talk to F.

...

Went to school like usual. Sat down in my spot LIKE USUAL. Jeana came up and talked to me a bit. I don‚Äôt remember what about. We talked and I was a bit spaced out.

I decided not to do my roaring 20‚Äôs essay. I could make up for those missing points with the final to keep my B.

Same with math, I helped Zach cheat on his mastery, and I helped myself. He‚Äôs like the only chill person I can cheat with.

I forgot that we were presenting or independent projects in 3rd hour. I asked to go Monday. I‚Äôm screwed if I don‚Äôt write and record tomorrow or Sunday. I‚Äôll probably do it Sunday instead of making a zine. :(

Started watching American Vandal. It‚Äôs funny as hell. Watched that through 4th-5th hour.
Missed F in the cafeteria. I went in after he was already leaving. Fuck me, I‚Äôm a moron.

I didn‚Äôt do much 6th hour. F sarcastically asked me if I watched the Chiefs game and I said I‚Äôm sooo sorry and that I‚Äôd checked the score during half time and that‚Äôs why they lost. He said he was like, damn, S‚Äî‚Äî- must have watched the game, when the Chiefs lost. I was glad he thought of me, that made me really happy, even if it was just the Chiefs losing.

Later in class he asked me if I had made anything at home or if I‚Äôd started my social commentary piece. I did my awkward shrug and said not really. Before he could really reply someone changed the subject and I continued to stare at the reflection of the ceiling light in the tray of water.

Then I checked my email because my phone buzzed and I got an email from Julie saying I got accepted into the art show. I verbally said ‚Äúoh wow. I got in this art show, holy cow‚Äù and Log and F and I briefly talked about the show. It‚Äôs really not that competitive anyways and I talked to Darby and Log about my sisters ugly painting that made it in as well. Maybe I have a chance if their crap made it in. Who knows.

Didn‚Äôt do shit in 7th hour.

I posted to my story about the Chiefs thing and the art show.

I went to MYM and awkwardly sat next to Log. Everyone was in a good mood. I wish I were a senior so I was closer to everyone here but I don‚Äôt want to be a senior for many reasons.
Their question of the week was where is your very specific favorite place to be.

My answer was walking to the grocery store right after sunset for a grape soda and some chocolate covered raisins and sitting along the cemetery drinking my soda before I walked back because it looks like a beer can and my road is busy. I didn‚Äôt say the last part, but it‚Äôs just for personal context. Everyone gave thoughtful answers. Jana shared the store about the drama that happened in photo with Margot.

Apparently Margot said something racist like go back to your country and everyone got really pissed at her and there was an argument. But from Jana‚Äôs perspective, it looked like some poor girl on the autism spectrum was being bullied. No Jana. Margot is a dumbass racist cunt. I do think people were being a bit rude openly talking about her behind her back and I wanted to tell Jeana and Logan that but I didn‚Äôt really completely.

After all that drama, we had a meditation circle. With music and mood lighting and we all sat in a circle and did breathing exercises and closed our eyes and sat in silence. It was so peaceful and I felt a little awkward mostly because Glenn was there but then I realized he‚Äôs just a senior I barely know and I don‚Äôt give a shit about him. The silence and idea of trying to clear my thoughts really made me scared and sad. I feel like my brain is always running 90 MPH since mom died because every time my mind actually goes blank I think of her. Not that I don‚Äôt want to think of her, it just makes me cry. And I did. I got a fat tear out and not much more. I hoped F saw but I think he was on instagram. I think he saw my story about the Chiefs and art thing then.

After MYM was over I sat outside with my poofy jacket that covered half my face for like 20 minutes until F passed by. I got really sad thinking about mom. I made myself almost sob. I was pretty rough. Zach from math and some guy walked by and he said hi Sydni and I said hi. It was so awkward, I hope he didn‚Äôt realize I was crying.

F finally passed by and gave a hearty wave and smile and I can‚Äôt remember if I smiled or not back. My tears had dried up by then and moments later dad pulled into the parking lot.

We went home and I made some soup and some bacon and I got ready for work real quick and had about 20 minutes spare time to cut my legs. It sounds so fucking sick. Oh Yeah, and I cut myself in the bathroom at school. You‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be a bigger detail but it really isn‚Äôt to me. It‚Äôs just become a part of the daily routine and it sickens me, but not enough. So I cut myself when I got home for not crying enough when F passed by and for me continuing in this cycle maybe ruining my chances before break. I don‚Äôt know. I cut a good amount of long ones. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve cut too many below my shorts line and by summer the scars won‚Äôt completely heal.

I went to work and worked for two hours. Pretty mundane and AD wasn‚Äôt there.

I changed and went to the high school youth group Christmas party. We played fishbowl and Kahoot. it was fun.

I talked to laura on the way back about my promotion at work and I talked to Zoe and hung up my blanket like a canopy and put some fairy lights on top. They kind of look like stars.

I want to continue watching American Vandal but I‚Äôm so tired. I think I‚Äôm just going to enjoy a nice night of sleep. I‚Äôll wake up early and maybe clean/ watch the show.

...

I also love how every day my entries are getting shorter and shorter. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm getting more and more bored with life. All I know is I‚Äôm glad I started doing this. It‚Äôs almost been two weeks since I‚Äôve started and it‚Äôs one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in a long time. I wonder if put together future me ever will read these. Who knows, and if so, you‚Äôve come so far. Congrats.

i‚Äôve been so anxious all day. stressed out by both talking and not talking to my ex. what should/can i say? should i not be talking? i honestly don‚Äôt know. even if i just don‚Äôt talk, that causes me anxiety.

i hate you for what you did. but i still love you. and it kills me. i want to detach. i want to move on. i want to be comfortable talking to no one.

i‚Äôm annoyed that i feel like we addressed a lot my issues yesterday, but you have so many issues too that need addressing. you need to go to therapy and check yourself but i can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to force you. but this isn‚Äôt my fault. you still hung out with this other woman today that is a fucking train wreck.

I kept thinking how to use English every day since I woke up this morning. Then I found I should combine English with my favorite things ----- writing physics articles. I have a physics Wordpress. It's called [Understanding(ÊÇüÁêÜ)](https://www.ethanideas.url.tw). I post lots of articles about physics education, history and philosophy of physics and some papers translations in there. Needless to say, I should create a blog. I should write physics articles in English. It's so difficult though. In a sense, my vocabulary isn't enough. I can recognize lots of words but it's hard to use them. Anyway, I should create it first. Here's my blog, [My Life as a Physics student](https://ethanideas619908541.wordpress.com). Well, I haven't finished my mathematical physics homework although I read lots of English posts on Reddit today. Sometimes I think reading english really wastes my time because it doesn't improve my score in graduate school, but I really love learning English. I've so many feelings that I don't know how to express in English. I've read lots of physics papers and textbooks so that I know how to logically write English arguments but I'm not familiar with expressing my feelings. Anyway, I'll write English diary every single day from now on. I hope it helps. Thanks for reading.

0,"day 8 - what have i done
evening thoughts.

i spent all morning anxious as hell because i met up with my ex. long story short, i slept with my cheating ex. he admitted to having sex with someone while we were together. i‚Äôm the only other girl he has been with, so this is pretty fucking shocking. i really wasn‚Äôt expecting full-blown sex okay? maybe just a stupid crush or something. the most fucked up part is this girl has a bf.

it cuts me so deep that he has issues with me and my emotionally stability, and maybe wants to pursue something with this woman who doesn‚Äôt communicate, cheats on her boyfriend, and remains in a toxic relationship where this guy steals money from her? somehow that‚Äôs more appealing than me. somehow he doesn‚Äôt see that she‚Äôs got some emotional baggage as well. but okay.

i mean, in a lot of ways i understand that he felt dissatisfied with the relationship. i was too. and although i strayed and thought i had feelings for someone else, i was always loyal to him while we were together.

all day i was hoping that we would eventually work things out, and maybe even if it‚Äôs not for a few months or even years. but i made a mistake today - a big one. because i don‚Äôt know if that can happen and maybe sleeping with him was just salt in the wound. i wanted one last nice night to remember, one last kiss to remember fondly but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm going to feel that way. the truth is, i plan on spending the time apart from him working on myself and improving. he says he doesn‚Äôt want to attend therapy and i am not sure if he wants to work on himself. if it‚Äôs one-sided, i don‚Äôt see us working. obviously if he finds that he truly doesn‚Äôt love me anymore (which honestly i don‚Äôt think is true), it will also hurt so bad.

this is just one big clusterfuck and i am glad we plan on spending at least a month apart. i need time to really think about everything. i love him, and always will. i respect him even after what he did. i want to spend time rebuilding what is broken and make a life together, but there are so many questions and unknowns. all i can do, is focus on myself. because regardless if my next relationship is with him or someone else, i want/need to be better. i need to change my behaviors. BUT they‚Äôre not all mine that need changing.

man i may be a fool, but that‚Äôs what love does to you."

I had a dream this morning I just forgot to write it down.

I woke up and barely got ready in time to go to QT with dad. I got my stuff ready and my picture of Audrey Hepburn for Mrs. A and went to QT. I got two egg rolls.

Put my present for Mrs. A and my coat in my locker and went to math. I struggled with the stupid thing we did. I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll do on the test tomorrow. Margot told me she‚Äôs buying a 3,500 furry suit. Fucking figures she‚Äôs a furry, what a naive kid. Finished ‚ÄúMoon‚Äù in seminar and went to the library for lunch. Did some accounting and some math and financial planning for the future, and started on a calendar for my phone.

We went through some poems for English. I spent the rest of class finishing up my calendar. It looks pretty sick. It makes me scared for how little time I have. Life is crazy.

Went to art portfolio and talked to Logan and jeana came in and said hi. Mrs. H came in and said she needed to talk to F about a student. We all wondered what happened. I got Log and Darby to go out in the hall to the bathroom and listen in but they did a shitty job of listening. Jeana came back later and told us that Willa had apparently used lead based glaze and may have ruined the kiln and everyone‚Äôs shit.

The only time F talked to me all hour is when he randomly asked if I was watching the Chiefs game. I said probably not because every time we watch a Chiefs game they lose. I told him that I was sparing the Chiefs by not watching and he thought that was pretty funny. I told Log about my promotion but F didn‚Äôt hear. Ughhh.

I went to the bathroom after class ended to wait for the halls to clear and to take a shit. I went up to Freelancer and walked in the door only to remember I left my thing for Mrs. A in my locker downstairs. I walked all the way down and all the way back up and about passed out. I wasn‚Äôt sure Mrs. A liked it that much at first but it really grew on her and she really loved it and she gave me a hug. I love her so much üíï! I helped her hang it up and another picture and made a button and stole one of a cat and she asked me if I had any obsessions like she did Audrey Hepburn. I told her I used to be really into Doctor Who. She said she had some friends who were. I told Jess and some people about my promotion at work and it was exciting and I love that group!

When I left, I saw log in the hallway and said hi and August showed me his book of kitchen Witchery. I left to go sit on the stairs at around 3:30. I watched Log leave and I sat there in the cold on the wet steps emailing and texting Julie about the art competition. I sat there huddled in my bag winter coat that covered my face up to my nose. I felt like a hunch back though. I need to lose weight and fix my posture. At around 3:48, F drive by and he smiled and waved and I tried to smile a little bit back but I realized you couldn‚Äôt see my mouth because of my coat. I felt like an idiot.

I didn‚Äôt cry. I wasn‚Äôt sad. I brought this on myself anyways. Dad picked me up and we drove home. He always says, ‚Äúhow‚Äôs S‚Äî‚Äî- doing?‚Äù Like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong, but I thought my acting was alright. I‚Äôm always good at acting though.

I got home and cut like one little cut on my leg. My blade was dull. I stole another pencil sharpener from school so it was all good. I went on to get the screwdriver and take out the blades later tonight.

I rearranged my entire room except for my dresser. My bed is no longer close to the window. I really like my new layout. I like how clean and organized my desk is. I pinned up a pamphlet from the art college and circled and drew arrows pointing to the art camp that I‚Äôm working my ass off to get a scholarship for.

I took a photo of my feet up on my desk and posted it to my Instagram. It was cool. F liked my photo and I felt so proud. I ate dinner and did more cleaning crap.

My sister decided she wanted to download a bunch of old iPhone games so I helped her a tiny bit. Laura cooked some bacon and I ate a few pieces. I went to my room to go to bed and now I‚Äôm writing this.

Claire just responded to my insta story about Mrs. A. I‚Äôm going to text her back now. I miss her so much.

Trying to resist cutting myself for the sake of cutting myself. It‚Äôs so hard when I have new blades though.

0,"Day 1 - Introduction
I'm not a native speaker but I want to practice English writing, so I come here creating a post. My name is Ethan. I'm 28 and studying my master's degree on nanoelectronics research. I'm constantly thinking how to practice English. It's difficult because I don't have much time. This morning, I had a solid-state physics class. Its loading is heavy. Besides, I have other two lectures, which are ""MOS capacitor device"" and ""Mathematical Physics."" Both of them are very difficult. I need lots of time reading book and writing homework. Apart from that, I also want to do lots of things. Well, that should leave to the future post.

&#x200B;

Back to the main topic. Today I read a little bit Michelle Obama's new book. It's easy to read. I kept thinking whether it is possible to study english every day when I read her book. I didn't pay attention to the lecturer. He is an old professor. I don't like him because I know he often prides oneself on being a veteran. After class, I went to library and tried to finish my mathematical physics homework. But I failed. I started thinking about the meeting contents with my advisor next Monday. My topic is designing a single-photon detector using avalanche photodiode. My current task is modeling the IV curves, finding the approximate SRH recombination and Hurkx tunneling current formulas. Well, it's not easy. I thought I've finish 50%. Although I want to focus on research, I was still distracted by other thoughts, like practicing English.

&#x200B;

Well.....it's so hard to write more. Let me finish this here. I hope I can continue writing diary tomorrow :)"
0,"Evening rant
Today was a day.
I didn't say as much stupid stuff as I normally do. So that's good.

I actually got up and went to swim practice this morning. That was decent. It was a rough workout but I liked it over all.

Work was fine. I realized I was unnecessarily throwing my boss that I like under the bus to our higher boss for literally no reason. It felt like I was doing it mostly out of immaturity and fucked up parental influences.

I am constantly thinking about my shitty amount of credit card debt and I'm not even done with Christmas gifts. I want to wait until after Christmas/tax return to figure out how bad it really is. Then fiance and I can talk about it. I think our blossoming hobbies just got out of control but I think we've reached a point where we can taper off for several months and I can fix this.

I've been working on the big present for my fiance in the garage and am making good progress so it should be done in time. He's going to love it.

My roommates boyfriend still continues to suck and be not great to her. He really doesn't appreciate her. It just grates on me because I love her as a sister and I hate to see someone take advantage of her kindness. I can't believe she still hasn't finished her master's degree even though she is so close to finishing it. Her anxiety and his discouragement is so strong and rooted in his own failure to finish his master's degree.

It's hard to deal with his mansplaining and his generally arrogance. I'm horrible at hiding my feelings from people when I don't like them.

My neice is still struggling with where to go to college and I am trying to figure out how to tell her parents she should come live with me and do community college for a year for the transfer scholarship and, little do they know, more relaxed time to get her mtf transition process started. I think my fiance is still a little uncomfortable with her living here but I'm pretty sure she will stick to herself and the little bit of rent will be helpful in us saving for a wedding.

Ugh. I should go to bed. I'm carpooling with my roommate tomorrow instead of going to swim because her car is straight up dead and I want to minimize the miles she puts on our other car.


I try to be a good person. I wish I could be as nice to myself as I am to others. I really need to work on my selfdiscipline. I'm going to require I go to swim at least once a week because that makes it so I'm paying 11 dollars a practice. Then once roommate gets a new car I will go twice a week. It's hard.

The kittens call me to go to bed. I should go now."

morning thoughts.

wow. it‚Äôs been a week since i‚Äôve started. i‚Äôve been working so hard on improving myself and even my therapist seems impressed. i‚Äôve learned so much.

I am going to keep journaling about my anxiety, and finding ways of self-care. i am focusing on remember that i need to be my first priority.

evening thoughts.

i can‚Äôt sleep. i am meeting up with my ex tomorrow just to talk. i am so grateful to see him again but also very nervous. not sure if it is the best idea, but i don‚Äôt want to talk about anything too serious. we don‚Äôt need to, really. i just want to talk to my friend.

i realized today that because we were long distance and i had a mental breakdown the day you left, i don‚Äôt remember our last kiss. i don‚Äôt know why this hurts so much, but it does. "

I dreamt this morning I just couldnt remember anything to write it down.

I woke up at 5 and by 5:20 freaked out because I thought I didn‚Äôt have time to shower and get ready. I thought it was 6:20 not 5:20 and showered and got almost completely ready before realizing at 5:50 that I had a whole other hour to get ready. So I curled up in bed and about fell asleep again.

I listened to an old HBM podcast I downloaded on the bus. It was exactly 20 minutes long. Perfect. I got to school and went to my spot in the cafeteria and sat there alone for a good 5-7 minutes before Jeana came over and had to talk to me about work and life and shit. We both god really excited about how much we both like our jobs and how much they‚Äôve helped us socially and shit. I‚Äôm glad she can confide in me although she can be a little touchy and huggy for my taste.

We finished the Great Gatsby in history. I watched a movie called circle on Netflix in first and third hour. And started another one called Moon.

We went on our field trip. I rode shotgun in the van with Mr. B. The museum of illusions was pretty cool not gonna lie. We came back and had good pizza. I took a test in 7th hour which sucked and I‚Äôm sure I failed but I don‚Äôt care. I just want to pass at this point.

Art club was awkward as hell. I‚Äôm sad this is the last one till next semester! I sat down a seat away from Log who was talking to F about his projects and missing ones etc. Somehow F knew about my field trip and asked where I went and if it was fun. Pretty short convo honestly. I sat there doing nothing looking like a sad idiot for the rest of the hour almost. F talked about his plans to work with ITKC next semester. I‚Äôm excited and he kept mentioned to talk to him or me if anyone had ideas. I felt really proud, he makes me so happy. I wanted to tell Logan about my promotion when F was around but I never got the chance. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow I just want F to know for some reason.

I sat there by myself talking to Athena awkwardly for the rest of the time. She‚Äôs so fucking weird what the hell. She was like talking about her supposed anxiety and I‚Äôm like bitch u have no anxiety you‚Äôre just a creepy kid who doesn‚Äôt know how to use the internet. I left without F even seeing me leave or saying goodbye. I cried and sat down on the stairs outside waiting for dad. He showed up right as F was backing out. I think he turned to look as I was walking to my car. I don‚Äôt know. We pulled out onto the road at the same time almost and were waiting at the intersection close to each other for a good while. I wonder if he saw me.

I got home and my sister talked to me about the local art show and I decided to submit something last minute because why not. I went through the drama of getting a good picture and submitting it and all that crap and had pizza for dinner. I got it submitted and posted to my story about missing 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take or something. Which I know that is F‚Äôs email signature, but it‚Äôs such a widely used quote so it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm a stalker creep.

I did cut one cut on my ankle. It wasn‚Äôt crazy deep but I feel empty if I don‚Äôt make at least one a day.

Youth group was alright. We had our youth group American idol. It was just me, Ali and Sarah and we sang a parody song of ‚ÄúI want a hippopotamus for Christmas‚Äù but it was ‚ÄúI want a new youth pastor for Christmas‚Äù we won and made the junior senior guys jealous and mad as hell. We ate our chocolate cake prize in the kitchen with plastic forks until I got sick.

Came home and helped my sister submit and watched her make a fool of herself.

And F replied to my insta story about the art show, ‚ÄúGo S‚Äî‚Äî!!!‚Äù I felt so proud it made me beam! I fucking love that man so much he makes me feel like a million bucks.

It was a pretty good day overall except for me fucking social awkwardness around F and the club. I really need to work on that, but I‚Äôm afraid if I talk too much I‚Äôll embarrass myself. But when I talk to little I hate myself too. Either way I go home and cut myself. I need a new fucking coping mechanism this isn‚Äôt working.

I hope I dream tonight. I think if I wake up at the right time I will. I‚Äôll try to write it down ASAP if I do.

First, a post for two days ago. Which would be.... Monday? I think I only worked one job that day? Both jobs? I am not sure. Oh, I remember. I had an ec opportunity that night so I only worked my morning job. The EC thing was kind of interesting actually, and I got to study a good but during it which was nice. After that I stayed at my grandmas and studied there. Made some questionable decisions while there but you live and you learn. Having some issues with bad thoughts at the moment. Will take some deep breaths and focus on this studying. I ended up doing alright on my final exam. I didn't do great honestly, but I did well enough for what I needed from the class. I didn't have to work my other job that day so I went home and got 2 of my projects done! Or so I thought. I realized this morning that I made a major mistake in my video project and had to refilm it. I also studied a good bit today, viewed an apartment that Her and I both liked, played some video games, and relaxed. Not a bad day. I am feeling anxious about some of my finals though. My one tomorrow doesn't worry me too much, but the ones after that do. Ugh. Alright, that's all for now. Back to studying."

 I gets real boring working at a phone repair shop all day the duration of 13 hours in one day is exhausting.

i got lazy to write here again. yesterday the coworker that wanted me to come in jokingly gave me a hard time because i didnt answer my phone to come to work. i honestly didnt care.  one of my coworker edd was jokingly talking crap about me to one of the baggers and i grabbed his id badge and threw it on the ground. he told me im very childish. that hurted.  he made me mad and i retaliated. plus i text him and he never replies. im deleting his number out my phone. fast forward to today. i was off from work and i didnt do anything except go for a walk and play pokemon on my nintendo 3ds.  in the game i got my first shiny and the pokerus virus. that never happened before. now im more addicted to it.  just need more pokemon friends to share my joy with.

i texted stephen today. he is the one that got suspended. i figure i keep him company while being off. im honestly starting to like him more. he says he thinks about me alot and im doing the same. um craving his butt sooo bad. i even thought about kissing him. he would be a good boyfriend but i also want someone strong physically and emotionally. maybe two boyfriend would be fun.

morning thoughts.

i have been still coming to terms with everything i put you through. i was a terrible girlfriend, and i did so many terrible things. i want you to forgive me, but it is important for me to forgive myself. I can then move forward to ensure these things do not happen. i need to call myself out, evaluate my feelings, and come from a place of love and no anxiety.  itsn‚Äôt it crazy that even as an engineer/logical person, i act far too often on emotion. or maybe i don‚Äôt. maybe i think things over too much, and get anxious and do something terrible because I have overthought it. that sounds a lot more like me.  stop overthinking. say how you feel. it‚Äôs okay to feel certain ways, you don‚Äôt need to hold it in. you don‚Äôt need to lie to everybody. give them space. grow yourself. love yourself. stay strong.

evening thoughts.

sometimes are easier, but most times i‚Äôm just hoping you‚Äôre thinking of me and wishing you could take back everything. i keep feeling like we were meant to me but apparently we weren‚Äôt. what you said to me killed me inside and i just can‚Äôt pick myself up from having trusted you and put so much into our relationship. if you didn‚Äôt feel that you loved me, why didn‚Äôt you say so? why didn‚Äôt you say you didn‚Äôt see us ending up together? why were you hanging out with someone new and not telling me?

one day, this will be for the best. and a lot of times i already feel that way. but damn it hurts. it‚Äôs hard to focus on self-improvement being home. i feel like i‚Äôm just very often distracting myself from everything.i don‚Äôt know what to say anymore. i just feel the same way over and over."

I dreamt this morning barely, but I couldn‚Äôt remember it. Probably because I didn‚Äôt get to bed till later.

Blasted my music on the bus and went to put my coat at my locker. Mrs. H asked if I was cold when she saw my socks and sandals. I wasn‚Äôt. It was kind of nice out.

I went to the cafeteria like normal and sat down where I usually sat. Sometime between yesterday and this morning F saw my Instagram story about idiot club. Ugh. I‚Äôm such a weirdo. But I was totally manic when I wrote that.

Continued the great Gatsby in history.. did some math in math.. I turned in my independent study course sheet to my counselor.. worked on my Christmas list instead of my independent project.. didn‚Äôt do much in English.. pretty average day honestly.

I went to lunch and got in line after F did. He said hi and I said hi and we went our separate ways getting lunch. I went to go get ketchup hoping to pass him again but he didn‚Äôt and left. He looked over where I usually sat though, but he didn‚Äôt know I was way behind him.

I finished lunch a lil early and went to 6th hr. I didn‚Äôt do much of anything besides listen to my music and look at memes. I try not to have high hopes for Tuesdays.. they are boring as hell. F asked me to help him and davin hang up inventions from his drawing 2 class. Mr. H came up and said hi briefly before going into the bathroom to probably bust some vapers. The bell rang and I went back to grab my stuff. When walking to class I stopped and asked F a question about the screen printer and then I went to 7th hr.

We watched videos on eels and got really off task. I hope the test isn‚Äôt tomorrow or else I‚Äôm fucked.

Blasted my music on the bus ride home and to the door. I left my coat at school. It wasn‚Äôt that cold though. I just hope it isn‚Äôt tomorrow. There were little pastries in a bag on the porch which I took inside they were for dad and L. I heated up some cheesy corn and ate it on the toilet and went back to my room.

I had the urge to cut so bad‚Äî not a ton, just one good line. Maybe two. And I did. I cut 2 lines midway on my thighs. I don‚Äôt even do it because I feel emotional pain anymore. I just cut because it feels good and I like to watch myself bleed. I finished getting ready for work and I got there feeling pretty good.

Work is the only place I know I‚Äôll talk to people. I really enjoy it now. Especially with my manager and Alex and people. Even some of the customers are nice except for the drooling weird old lady. My manager later told me that he wanted to talk to me about something. I followed him back to the office. I wasn‚Äôt worried really, but deep down I got a little nervous, but who isn‚Äôt when they are called to talk to someone in private. He told me to pull up a chair and he told me that he thinks I‚Äôm good at what I do and that I pretty much know everything about frontline. He told me he wanted to make me a trainer if it was alright with me, he said he might be able to work out more pay too. I was excited and so honored that he would ask me! Finally my hard work and loyalty had paid off. All I need to do is complete some more Etraining and I can start! I hope it all works out. I‚Äôm gonna try to start Monday after school because I‚Äôm way too busy this week with homework and studying.

I ordered some food and waited for like 15 minutes because I put the wrong button on the machine. Good going!!! Ugh. I told dad about my possible trainer promotion and he didn‚Äôt really give a shit. He never gives a shit. He doesn‚Äôt care about me or my life anymore except when I do something wrong. I just want him to be excited for me for once. Where the fuck has my dad gone?

I spent the next two hours sending my Xmas list to grandparents and dad and making a music playlist for Nat.

This day flew by. It was so boring except for the whole promotion thing.

Looking forward to my field trip tomorrow and art club. It‚Äôll be fun I hope. I‚Äôm just sad this is the last art club in a long time. Almost a month. I‚Äôm super tired now and I‚Äôll either cut myself or use self control and just go to sleep. Either way, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

Jesus Christ what a fucking boring day.

Woke up early to shower and fold my zines.. my shitty, shitty zines. Sat in bed wet and freezing my ass off until I barely made it out the door on time. It was so cold out. Didn‚Äôt bring my earbuds so sat in silence on the bus trying to keep my hands warm between my legs.

Went to the cafeteria like normal hoping to sit by myself and cry hoping F would see me, but NoOoOoO.. Jeana had to tell me all about how drunk she got Friday night and all the drama that ensued. I was happy she was talking to me and we had a good laugh but I felt so weird with my back to F, knowing he could see me and I couldn‚Äôt see him.

I got called up to my counselors office during 2nd hr. I was kinda nervous and got really anxious even though I knew it was only about taking an independent study next semester. I sat down and tried to explain to her my reasonings for doing so but she stopped me and was like bitch tell me what class you wanna drop. We got it all figured out and I got a little green paper I needed to have F fill out.

I restarted my independent project in creative writing. I didn‚Äôt like the way the story was going before. I adjusted the tone and voice and it sounds a lot better now. Got a lot more work to do on it. Great, just what I need is more homework and shit to get done.

Had a little too much fun in 5th hr with Zach and Mrs. Hair. Looking forward to our field trip Wednesday.

Went to lunch and waited forever at my table for F to go get his food. I thought it‚Äôd be weird if I went in AFTER he got his food and shit. So I decided to go before thinking he‚Äôd come in when I got my food. I was partially right. He came in when I was typing in my code to pay for my food. He was wearing the Art Club shirt and made me smile. I don‚Äôt think he saw me. I went back and ate my chili like a loser at my lunch table.

I snuck into 6th hr early after lunch and got my stuff all settled down. I took off my denim jacket. My scars were exposed but no one looks at my arm that closely, and if they did, I don‚Äôt care. I sat there like a dumbass and made some dumbass comment to Henry about our project. I felt so idiotic. I asked F if he could help me fill out the independent study sheet he said yes. He went to go help some other people and with 15 mins of class left, I went over to ask him if he could help me fill out the sheet. He did. I just sat across from him at my table in silence as he filled out the form. Not a word. I said thanks and he left to help someone else. It was alright in my mind because there was zine club later.

After a failed science test, it was finally zine club time. I walked in a couple minutes late and it was only Aug and Addie and F. We had a few good convos about shitty teenage bands and they kept wanting to see my zine and when they did F was always in the dark room. Eventually fucking annoying little Athena and her shitty freshman friend came in the room playing their ukuleles. I didn‚Äôt mind for the first minute. But the fucking ukuleles didn‚Äôt stop. They started practicing some annoying ass song and I started losing my mind. I fucking hate ukuleles. I went out into the hall to clear my mind of the noisy instruments. No one else, not even F seemed bothered by them really. After one more time of leaving to go to the hall to pretend to take a call, I texted Aug telling him I could t stand the fucking ukuleles. He came out in the hall and I whined about them for a minute or so.

When I went back in the ukuleles still didn‚Äôt stop but I guess I got used to it. I finally gave my zine to Aug and to Addie and Athena and her little friend. It was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done. The fucking awkwardness of sitting there like a fat ugly loser while some of your few peers read your personal and dark story about the death of your birds? It‚Äôs awful. Then F must‚Äôve noticed and asked if I‚Äôd made a zine. I said yeah and laughed my ugly nervous laugh. He asked what the theme was and I said water, I guess, but not really. I told him that I got inspired from the Rene Stout exhibition. He didn‚Äôt really hear me or he thought it was just stupid.

He sat down a seat away from me and read the zine. The awkwardness was unbearable. His expressions are completely blank when he reads my zines. I like that. No fake awhs or laughs. Just looking at it at face value for what it is. I kept laughing too much and I felt so singled out among the outcast freshmen and F. I wanted to leave. I wanted to go scream and bang my head on a locker. But I couldn‚Äôt. Someone asked me if the story was real or not and I said yeah. They almost didn‚Äôt believe me. F asked the same thing later he just worded it differently. I think then he told me about his bird that died when he was young. He told me about how he buried it at the park across the street. He said that whenever he looked out his window he thought of his dead bird and it made him sad. Then apparently one day he watched three boys go over and pee all over it. He said he remembered being so angry and pissed off.

I felt genuinely sorry for him. I could tell that had been a memory of his that‚Äôd been repressed for a long time. Also his  left eye was kind of swollen and looked dark and I couldn‚Äôt stop focusing on it. Strange.

We didn‚Äôt do much else. I left at the same time as Athena and her friend. She commented on my space potato piece in the hallway not knowing it was mine. So I talked to her about it. Then F came out and left for his car and saw me talking about the potato piece. I felt weird because I wouldn‚Äôt have brought it up. The scenario made it look like I was showing off my piece. Athena asked if it was made with real potatoes and I saw F kind of laughing or what I thought him to be laughing as he walked off. I laughed too because of the inside joke about the potatoes and said something like ‚ÄúHAHAHAH he knows all about the potatoes‚Äù and laughed like a weirdo.

I ran out to sit on the steps as quickly as I could. There really was no point in looking too sad and crying when I‚Äôd just been laughing kind of. But I genuinely was tearing up and already started my daily bullying of myself. I knew I‚Äôd cut when I got home. F passed by but he didn‚Äôt smile and he was on the phone but he waved kind of. I think I initiated the wave too much. Ughhghhh.

I got home and cut away at my leg. Not too many because dad had just texted me saying we were going out to a really nice place for their anniversary dinner. I was scared I‚Äôd bleed through my pants but thankfully I never did. Dinner was pretty average and later after we ate dad mentioned something about being goof to get it 100% free in reference to the art camp and college. I started tearing up because that was never going to be a possibility no matter how hard I worked. Everything costs. And I don‚Äôt give a shit if it costs. I want to go to college so fucking bad. The rest of the trip home was awkward. Dad asked me what was wrong and I said I was fine and he believed me, or at least gave up on trying to talk to me.

I went back to my room and cried some more about shitty parents and art college and life and my uncreativity. I started cutting more but in random places and a kind of deep one above my knee. Well shit. I‚Äôve probably ruined my chances with shorts for a long time until I can figure out how to fix this.

After talking to Milla a little bit and looking st some art I got the confidence to go make some. I measured it all out but I had no ideas when I went to draw. I gave up after a while and went back to bed to write this.

I rediscovered that my creative passion, energy, drive and fuel all come from F‚Äôs praise and instagram. So I‚Äôm trying to get back into the habit of posting. Maybe I‚Äôll dream tonight? It‚Äôs the right time but I‚Äôm so tired I don‚Äôt know if it will work or not. Night shithead. "

I wanted to wake up to your body pressed against mine. I wanted to spend all my time with you and indulge in vacations and trips. In hobbies. Do projects together.

Hell, I even met your family. Extended family, even. They liked me. I liked them. I thought we were cool. I thought waiting a couple years to see you was going to be nothing.

When love is real, a couple years is just time on a clock. It's not that deep. That's all it is. And then after that we'd have our whole lives. We even knew what we wanted to call our kids. I felt fulfilled. Even in moments where I thought I couldn't do it anymore or moments where I wanted to absolutely shout at you over the phone I kept it together.

It's funny. Not ha-ha funny, but weird funny. You can tell someone all your secrets and everything you've ever wondered. Let yourself be utterly vulnerable. Only to be alone again. Completely. Back to square one.

I never gave up on you. Or us.

But I guess you did. "

I dreamt last night like I had hoped. I think I‚Äôve got a system down. I wrote this down after I woke up. It was a weird dream that lasted a really long time. My main takeaway was that F was ignoring me. But I need to remember, it‚Äôs just a dream.

‚ÄúI was working and it was really cold and I don‚Äôt remember much except I opened the door to the patio and made everyone cold and felt bad hen we are at Ali‚Äôs for thanksgiving or some other meal but it wasn‚Äôt her house but F was there. He ignored me the entire time we were there. Someone asked him what he‚Äôd been up to over the weekend and he just said art. It was so weird, the fact that he didn‚Äôt acknowledge my presence whatsoever, not even a glance. Another fragment of the dream I was this weird dark room with lots of other students sitting on the floor. We were all on our computers and I remember something about F still ignoring me. It was weird.‚Äù

Sunday school was finally downstairs for the first time in like 5 weeks. Had decent convos with everyone. Made a joke about the music sounding like we‚Äôre in a Hobby Lobby and everyone laughed because they knew exactly what I meant.

Spent most of the church service looking at the local art colleges website.

Got home, caught up on two episodes of Doctor Who.

Went to Target with the sis and Grandma. Bought myself a lil red purse, some lipstick for my secret Santa gift, and a wallet for my sis. We both bought each other something, she got me earrings, and we agreed the day before Christmas to wrap both our gifts up and pretend like we got each other something.

Hung out with her for like 2-3 hours before the care group potluck. We had a good heart to heart. She opened up to me about her self consciousness about her body. Told me she‚Äôs scared of these ‚Äúlines‚Äù on her hips. Told her those were just stretch marks and completely normal. I would have showed her mind to reassure her, but I didn‚Äôt want to risk her seeing my cuts. We talked about our dreams for the future. I told her all about how High School gets better, I told her about my plans for college. It was good. I haven‚Äôt been able to connect with her like that in a really long time. It emotionally and socially exhausted me. It‚Äôs hard having an extroverted little sister.

I ate a bunch of cheesy corn at the potluck and then retired to my room to work on my zine for tomorrow. The theme was water, I stuck to it loosely but made one about Tucky and Squacker‚Äôs death and burial in the lake. All of my good ideas for zines are about death and burials and funerals and depressing shit. The last two I‚Äôve made mentioned funerals multiple times, with the last one literally being two sisters planning their funerals. I‚Äôm so fucked. I hope F doesn‚Äôt see the correlation but at the same time I hope he does. If he asks about the birds, I‚Äôll say I got my inspiration from the Rene Stout exhibition which isn‚Äôt exactly a lie.

I just love making these little books so much. I love writing out the shit I need to get out and twist them into appropriate stories I wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing with people I respect or my friends. It‚Äôs a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon instead of doing my homework.

I‚Äôm gonna wake up tomorrow, shower, and fold my zines. Hope they turn out.

Probably won‚Äôt dream tonight either, which I‚Äôm sort of bummed about. But it‚Äôs alright. My subconscious is fucking sick either way. "

morning thoughts.

I thought i was doing better yesterday, but I also figured it wouldn‚Äôt last. couldn‚Äôt sleep last night until 3am, woke up twice. had a panic attack. can‚Äôt stop thinking about how you do not love me anymore. i feel unlovable, worthless, and insecure. i feel like i don‚Äôt deserve love. i feel so rejected, 4.5 years doesn‚Äôt warrant a conversation in person? the only thing keeping me okay is thinking that we are going to work this out in the future - but i feel like it‚Äôs unhealthy to set me hopes high. i need to accept that this probably won‚Äôt happen. i should be grateful that we had a good relationship for the first part.  i need to figure out if you were even good for me, because i haven‚Äôt been able to evaluate that yet. i need to set myself straight before i make any big decisions. i think that‚Äôs important to remember - no big decisions, including texting/talking with you.

i need to keep reading my book, read more books, listen to more music, watch more youtube videos, and learn to love myself and be comfortable in my own skin. when i find myself again, then i can be in a relationship. i don‚Äôt know who i am. when people ask me about my hobbies, i get nervous because i don‚Äôt know what to say. what do i do besides school? nothing it seems. what do i like to do - bike? hike? read? watch tv? spend time with my cat? code? volunteer? honestly i feel like i don‚Äôt know. i don‚Äôt even have a sense of style. my closet is mainly plain t-shirts. what even is that?

the real question is who do you even do that, ‚Äúfind yourself.‚Äù i‚Äôm 24 i feel like i should have some idea. i know what music i like. i know that i like to bike/hike but not dedicate every moment to them. i like to cook. how do i feel about things? do i have opinions about things? what does loving yourself even mean? I honestly don‚Äôt know. is it more than acceptance? because i think acceptance is a weak virtue.

i‚Äôve been a shell of a person since i was 14.

midday thoughts.

I‚Äôm realizing that my ex has been in the breakup process for 6 months. when we first broke up, he grieved, and we got back together and he was still always moving on. He‚Äôs 6 fucking months ahead of me and that hurts like hell. he‚Äôs moved on with another woman, and i‚Äôm sitting here grieving. why couldn‚Äôt you just turn me away before. let me move on earlier, before i move 2000 miles from my family and friends. why did you need to prolong this for me.

more midday thoughts.

it became very real that for the past 6 months, even though we were dating, you were busy moving on. You‚Äôve had time to grieve. when I get to where you are, you will be a year in. I have to accept that that is more than enough time for you to move on. we‚Äôre never getting back together. that‚Äôs really had to accept, but i have to. i don‚Äôt have a choice. all i can do is focus on myself. so i cancelled my trip to AZ and bought a flight home today. i‚Äôve never done anything so crazy, but i need to. it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best.

evening thoughts.

I may have jumped a gun and probably spent too much money switching flights, but I am grateful. I am grateful to get to be around the people who love me by tomorrow. I am grateful to catch up with some old pals.

I‚Äôm doing a little better - I had a full blown breakdown this afternoon (hence why I switched my flights), but I have been watching some Coach Craig and it‚Äôs very inspirational. This man is great and I am so happy he has some free content available. Just even to hear some outside opinions is very comforting. I am more convinced now that this was the grass is green syndrome, and I know that my ex will at least question if he made the right decision and that‚Äôs comforting. I do truly believe that another woman cannot stand up to me because we had such an incredible, long, relationship. I understand though - he has never been with anyone else and I get why he needs to see the playing field. I have felt that way too. I know that a lot of this is very overwhelming. I mean, we were talking about marriage when you‚Äôve only been with one person. It‚Äôs scary and you shouldn‚Äôt commit to someone when you‚Äôre not 100% positive. So I think this was the right thing to do. It sucks, but it needed to happen. And if/when he realizes that we had something irreplaceable, we can talk then. If we end up together, I believe that this would only strengthen us. If we don‚Äôt, this will only strengthen me for future relationships or just being alone. there‚Äôs a big positive side to this that I‚Äôm overlooking by my immediate grief and sadness, but that‚Äôs understandable. right now i just need to let myself feel. let myself heal. this month, just do only what i want to do and give myself back the right to say no when something is not good for me. give myself back the freedom i didn‚Äôt have. give myself back myself."

Alright, time for two quick posts. Bit of anxiety today and yesterday but not too bad. I got a bit of work done over the weekend but need to study a whooooole lot tomorrow night. I will probably be up fairly late studying for my exam on Tuesday I'd imagine. And Wednesday and Thursday will be me finally completing my projects. I have a good start on all of my projects now. I just need to finish up one; print, cut, and glue for one; and finally, record the other one. I got a script done for my video project which I think should be enough length. It doesn't say in the description that we need to be in the video ourselves so I think I will just read from my script and record my hands and whiteboard. I should have done a bit more work today. I probably could have studied and finished up two projects. Oh well. Going to study a little more tonight and then sleep. Also, we got a Switch today which is so exciting and I want to play it but I have to refrain until exaaaaams."
0,"day 3 - later night thoughts
I‚Äôm actually doing great. I usually break down at night, but today has been eye-opening and incredible. We broke up not even a week ago, and I‚Äôm already feeling a little better. I‚Äôm feeling grateful I have time to work and focus on myself. I have already learned so much. Maybe this was a blessing - I mean, I know it was. We‚Äôll see if this feeling lasts, but so far I am doing okay without you. I only need me. For this first time in my life, I feel okay with that.

I‚Äôve almost always been in a relationship. I‚Äôm 24 and have been in two 4 year relationships, and 1 one-year relationship. That‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve always had someone intimate to talk to. I‚Äôve been very dependent. But I don‚Äôt need that. I am okay with myself. One day, I will fully love myself and give myself the respect I deserve. I couldn‚Äôt do that when I was in a relationship. I need a few months (or even years) to focus on me. Then I will be ready to be in another relationship.

today was another okayish day. ill do a quick catchup. i visited my sister yesterday. we talked for 20 minutes and then it was just silence. i never was good with conversations.im going to make an effort to see her more often. my coworker added me to a groupchat but so far no one been active. its a good thing because i wouldnt want to talk to them all the time like that. i finally switched to thr $60 plan on metropcs for the amazon prime. turns out some stuff like unlimited music i still have to pay for but at a slightly reduced price.
i need to get this out. so a coworker quit three weeks ago and my manager still has her on the damn schedule.  she fixed it last week but for some reason put her on. im thinking what the fuck is wrong with her? it irritated me because i know they are going to be calling my phone tomorrow asking me to work. its a late shift and the closing manager is a bitch. she is always yelling at me and being rude to me. the head manager is always playing games.  she make me sick. there is not too many people  that can cover the shift. im pretty much the only viable option at this point. it pisses me off because it takes away the chance for me to find a better job. i been there 4 years and i havent quit because i need to have a job that i actually like and can do well. at this point im so angry. i know i might as well take the shift but damn. another reason why i hate my job and everyone there..."

I woke up at 9. I texted Milla about her little date with her crush, it was so cute. I‚Äôm so happy for her.

Went to work, it was pretty average. Trained Alex on how to use the iPad to take temps. Someone flicked my managers hat off and got the first time in over a year I realized he had no hair whatsoever under his hat. We all laughed so hard and I started crying. It was hilarious, I‚Äôve never laughed that hard in my life.

I also made a ketchup packet portrait of Andy.


... Saturday‚Äôs are always uneventful, I think I‚Äôll just review this week as a whole and what my biggest takeaways were.

I‚Äôve decided I need help to stop my self harm and suicidal thoughts. The suicidal ones scared me too bad, and I‚Äôm afraid if left untreated I‚Äôll end up close to death, if not dead.
This makes me so unsettled because I never dreamed I‚Äôd be a cutter, I used to say I‚Äôd never have the guts or the reasons to.. but look at me now. It was only 46 days ago that I‚Äôd made the first cut, now both my thighs are literally completely covered in scars and day old cuts.
I‚Äôm scared that if my suicidal thoughts are left to continue like this, I may attempt someday. Ugh, I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôd never kill myself, it‚Äôs not even an option whatsoever.

Every time I cut, it‚Äôs just a cycle:
- feels good, takes my mind off shit and I feel less shitty about myself
- that night/morning I look at my scabbed wounds and cry wondering why I would do anything so disgusting.
- I look in the mirror later that day and see the sheer amount of scars and cuts and I realize I have a serious problem.
- I start getting sad and kind of try to reach out for emotional support.
- The weekend comes and I forget all about my cuts while working. They no longer shock me, they just are a part of me.
- I feel confident on Monday and wear short sleeves to school.
- And the cycle continues.

In addition to the SH. I‚Äôve realized I enjoy dreaming. It takes my subconscious thoughts and twists them and I kind of like it even though they hurt so bad. I‚Äôm trying to finish this up quick so I can fall asleep now and wake up with a dream. For some reason if I go to bed right at 10 when I‚Äôm still not super tired, I usually dream. I like to interpret them, and find out where they came from. What sick thought or feeling turned into these nightmares.

Weekends help me remember I can make it on my own without me thinking about F, and what he thinks of me all the time. I feel bad when I haven‚Äôt made anything to impress him over the weekend. I know my artistic endeavors shouldn‚Äôt be fueled by his admiration and respect, but they are such a motivator.

I think the real reason I think about him all the time is because first of all, he‚Äôs got a perfect life. He teaches advanced art at high school, AND a super awesome class at the local art college. Even his wife and kids are beautiful, and now that I found out where he lives, even his house is perfect. I still can‚Äôt believe I used to pass it every day and never knew.
Second of all, his art taste is divine, I love how dark and grotesque his forte is and the artworks and images he‚Äôs drawn to and loves are simply beautiful. I even love his music taste. He‚Äôs made me want to listen to more undiscovered and alternative stuff. I‚Äôm slowly working on it, and I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve taken the efforts to build my music reservoir and taste.
Thirdly, he‚Äôs the only person in my life who praises me for my creations and just me being me. No one else does that like he does. He genuinely cares about me and my well-being, more than any person has that wasn‚Äôt my mom. He cares about my future, and the fact that I‚Äôm food enough for him just being me, makes me so happy.
Not to mention how funny he is, and how serious he can be. I love that he loves his classes, and I love the fact he supports and sponsors so many clubs. I love the fact he sponsors a mental health club, even if the few times I go I feel like a total loser and outsider. But it‚Äôs just that classroom... something about it makes me feel so safe. I never want to leave it. If I could live, work, eat, and sleep in there I would.

I think that‚Äôs why he impacts my life so much. He‚Äôs a great role model and mentor and no one can tell me otherwise. I know I get stalkerish and creepy talking about it, I completely realize that. But it‚Äôs hard not to obsess over someone who you respect to greatly that actually cares about you.

This weeks been a blur and had its highs and lows like usual. I‚Äôm glad I started journaling, even if I‚Äôm posting it to fucking reddit of all places. I wonder if people actually read all this shit I write. I don‚Äôt do it for others to read, or even myself. I just need to write to solve this shit show of emotions that is my head.

I need to either make a zine about water, and finish etching my plate tomorrow, or do my homework and study for finals. The battle between F and the potential of me getting an F. Hah.

Anyways, I wonder if future me reads these at all, or if my account ends up deleted and these entries erased from history. Either way I hope future me is doing okay and is happy with herself.

0,"day 3 - codependency revelation
I posted my morning thoughts in the breakups subreddit this morning - just questions I have but don't want answered.

Midday thoughts

Today I am doing much better. I have only cried once. I (again) cancelled by winery trip because didn't think I could make it 7+ hours talking about something not related to the breakup. I'm too focused on one thing right now. But since I ran out of coffee, I went to a coffee shop and had two cups and a burrito. Spotted a book I used to love as a child, and read through it and sent it to my dad. I can't believe people make money writing the simplest little books.

I went to the library but they didn't have the books I wanted, so I stopped by the bookstores and bought like $40 worth of books (two were christmas presents though). I'm really excited to start reading Co-dependence No More, the woman at the register told me it changed her life. Hopefully mine too. I also splurged and bought myself a new dress and two cardigans from a consignment shop. I have been disappointed in my wardrobe since I moved and cut it down by about 2/3. I wear the same clothes every week because I physically do not have more than that. I like to stay minimal but I also want to feel good about myself sometimes. I own about 6 shirts and that's not an exaggeration.

The rest of the day I'm just prepping for my flight tomorrow and reading my new books. Excited for some warm weather in AZ. I still need to work on my research, but...maybe next week.

Evening thoughts.

The ONLY book I wanted to check out from the library that was available was ‚ÄúCodependent No More.‚Äù I believed this meant that I was meant to read this book now and holy shit was I right. I am codependent. I‚Äôve been journaling and taking notes on the book in addition to this, but I‚Äôm realizing that growing up the way I did (torn apart home, alcoholics everywhere, autistic and violent brother, raising myself from a young age) that I became co-dependent. I thrive on destructive relationships, and when I‚Äôm not in crazy ones I create them. I am controlling, manipulative and it‚Äôs because I want better for people but it ends up poorly. I try to help so much and feel guilty when I don‚Äôt. I think that‚Äôs why my world revolves around volunteer working and dedicating my life. There‚Äôs a lot more to this in my other journals - but basically, I completely understand when I am codependent.

I controlled my ex to a point that annoyed me. I tried to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù him get a job, go to school, get good grades, etc. And when we started dating his grades improved and his dad actually thanked me. Then, it stopped working and I felt like I had lost him. He didn‚Äôt appreciate me or love me and it kept getting worse. I also wanted to volunteer so much I wasn‚Äôt willing to give him the time he needed. I wanted to live a missionary‚Äôs life and expect him to stay (not exactly missionary, but traveling a LOT for extended periods). and he had issues with this growing up because his father always traveled. wow am I stupid. I‚Äôve done this in past relationships too. It‚Äôs mad almost that it took me this long to realize. I am so grateful for this book and to the person on reddit who recommended it. can‚Äôt wait to keep reading and learning. this book has given me a lot of hope for a better future."

Well, it's Friday which means I am assuming you're probably hanging with you're new girl, which sucks. I'm at home watching Gilmore Girls which is actually incredible. This show gets me.

I had to send you money which is kinda like breaking NC but I felt bad that you paid me back for a trip and they refunded me. I hate it though - because either way it ends badly. You don't say anything or ask about the money, I feel shitty. You reach out, I feel shitty. maybe i should've just kept the money. fuck. I've been listening to comeback by Ella Eyre on repeat. I love this woman and this song - thank you for this gold mine.

I finally for to nap, which was incredible. I haven't been sleeping almost at all so passing out felt incredible. But of course, I woke up sad. I actually had a pretty depressing dream about you and your new girl. But hey - at least I slept.

I reignited my winery trip - but I'm the dd. I'm hoping they've got tea or something. It beats sitting at home doing research work. Although it's really important to get that stuff done like ASAP, I can't get myself to get started. I just have too many thoughts to process. I just finished my finals - I need a few days off for a little bit. I am not getting paid for research at the moment, so they can wait. You've gotta focus on yourself somethings.

my dad sent me some christmas gifts a little early, and I caved to open them. I needed something to rise my spirits. He sent me a salt lamp and an essential oil diffuser which are some things that I needed right now to calm down. I'm glad I didn't wait.

although I feel a little bit better, and I'm crying less I feel like I can't be motivated to anything but watch TV or play Tetris. Which maybe comes with finishing finals, but I am afraid that I am just moping around and letting myself feel isolated. as much as I don't really want to go and do things, I need to get out of the house tomorrow. I need to get out of the house.

we'll see if I can actually sleep tonight. didn't eat dinner. don't think I can get myself to do it."

Bit of anxiety here and there today but not bad. I worked a lot of course and feel tired at the moment. About to get ready for bed because I have to work in the morning. I took a quiz tonight and worked a liiiiitle bit on some ideas for my video project. I hope to finish that up tomorrow along with my timeline project that I need to do. I think the second one will just take a bit of time to actually sit down and do but it shouldn't be hard I don't think. If I can just get those things out of the way I would mostly just have exams left to worry about. I need to get ready for bed and sleep though so I am going to do that after this. I can worry about school tomorrow once I get out of class. That's all for now."

I cut my bangs this morning. They needed a good trim.

I still can‚Äôt remember the dream I had last night. I remembered fragments for the seconds after I woke up and they were gone as quick as they came.

I bought my water bottle and sat down in the same spot of the cafeteria I always do in the morning. I made myself tear up once and I just looked kind of miserable and bored.. at least I think I did.

I tried everything not to make eye contact with F. It‚Äôs bad enough I sit on purpose in a spot directly in his eyesight, but the last thing I need is eye contact. But we did. Brief and maybe he didn‚Äôt notice. I sat there for a whole minute awkwardly staring at the wall until I decided to pull out my phone to not look so weird.

I had a groupme notification from F. That must‚Äôve been why he looked up at me like that earlier. I wasn‚Äôt sure to reply right there, that seemed like the most awkward thing to do. I took three or four minutes to reply to his message about not being able to switch hours next semester. By the time I responded I was already leaving the cafeteria to go to class. We sent a few short messages back and forth figuring out what hour I could do. Then out of the blue he sent me a really long one that really touched my heart. He asked if I had reached out to the local art college representative and that I should, and that I have a 99.999999% chance of getting into the school. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed with joy whenever I read it or think about the fact that he cares so much about me.

I replied and he replied back. It was great. So much for looking depressed, but how could I when I have someone I respect and admire so much looking out for me.

Aced my math test, the day started out pretty good! Even in third hour Mrs. A sat next to me and we briefly chatted. We had snacks in 3rd AND 4th hr. And even 5th hour was good too. But all this happiness and upbeat spirits left me feeling guilty. I felt guilty for being happy and enjoying life. I don‚Äôt know why‚Äî still don‚Äôt. But I did.

I went down to lunch and got in line just in time. I only bought water because I was too full from snacks in my other classes. I thought at most maybe I‚Äôd see F and give an awkward smile, but someone tapped my shoulder and I turned to look but it was F and he tapped my shoulder on the other side to make me look. Old joke but it made me laugh. I said something dumb like ‚Äúhaha, I was like whaaa?‚Äù Ugh, but it wasn‚Äôt horrible.

I didn‚Äôt sit with my lunch table. I feel like an outsider, even with S and G there. I don‚Äôt do drugs, I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt have sex, I‚Äôm pretty fucking boring compared to the others there but they‚Äôre nice and tolerate me. I‚Äôm really grateful for them actually.

I sat out in the hallway with Aug and Log and Jean and Zach etc. They were so nice to me I wanted to cry tears of joy. They are such supportive friends and I just got overwhelmed with the good vibes coming from everyone. I love them so much.

I didn‚Äôt do much in portfolio, I got my research done and after giving up on sitting there silently eating my almonds all class Log and I started talking about the weird ass dreams we‚Äôve had. F saw my bag of almonds and said ‚ÄúAw Nuts‚Äù before my stupid brain processed the joke he was already talking to someone on the other side of the room. Yay.

I told Log about the weird dreams I‚Äôve had this week, even the one where I dreamt I saw F in a Wendy‚Äôs and my dad and him fought about cults. Log said I should tell F because it was funny but I freaked out and was like no no no no nooo no no. He didn‚Äôt understand why, but the emotional impact that dream had on me still makes me shiver. I left class without even saying bye to F or anyone. I thought about forsythia and how much that bush meant to Mom and I.

I talked a little more than I should have in 7th hr. It wasn‚Äôt devastating but it was foolish of me.

I lied to dad about why I was staying after school and I went to MYM. It was weird. I got there fashionably late. The only person I knew was Log, and even he was tuned out the entire time. So many Seniors I barely knew. They all seemed so happy, it made me so jealous. Even Glenn was there which was awkward considering he‚Äôs in my 7th hour and we kind of talked.. ish. They did question of the day and by the time it got to me I left the room pretending to take a call or something and I came back after they had passed where I sat. No one knew. I hope. I should have answered but Glenn was there and I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable.

We all made positivity paper snowflakes or some silly crap like that. Alex tried taught everyone how to fold it, except my mostly empty table. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how she folded it and I got really mad at myself and tried not to cry just because of all the overwhelming feelings I‚Äôd been having. I thought I folded it right and cut it out and when I unfolded it, it looked like two sad pizzas. I crumpled them up and just sat there watching people.

F walked by our table finally and asked what happened to my snowflake jokingly. I said I didn‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not very good at it. He said that this way was complicated and he never did it that way as a kid. I cut up paper and fiddled with shit in front of me to not look so creepy and sad just sitting there staring at people.

I‚Äôm worried that my weird attitude when I he talks to me and I talk back is scaring him off from being so friendly with me. I think he knows something is off, but I don‚Äôt think he thinks twice about it yet. I‚Äôm making progress but it‚Äôs never enough.

When everyone stared to leave I left right after them not wanting to just sit there. I can‚Äôt remember if he said bye or not. I don‚Äôt think so.
I went outside and sat in the cold freezing my butt off hoping F would drive by like he always did but he was late today and dad picked me up before F would drive by. I told myself when sitting on the steps that if F drove by before dad picked me up and I gave him a sad half smile with my red puffy eyes then I wouldn‚Äôt cut myself when I got home, and if my dad got here before F... well then I‚Äôd carve up my leg like a turkey.

And I did, my dad got there first... I got home took the super sharp new blade from my pencil sharpener and cut my leg 50 times before I had to stop and get ready for work. After doing all that I really started to realize that I have a serious mental issue, and that if this shit I‚Äôm doing continues then I could end up doing irreversible damage to my body and my head. I keep having suicidal thoughts and though I‚Äôd never ever do it, or attempt it, it really concerns me that I‚Äôm thinking about it so often.

Work was fine, but in the last 30 mins, I went to the bathroom to check up on my leg only to find that the cuts had opened back up and had bled all over the inside of my work pants. I tried to make a bandage out of toilet paper but it didn‚Äôt work. I decided to tough it out and pray it stopped bleeding so I could finish the last 30 minutes of my shift.

Grandma picked me up because the fam was at the church concert. I turned on the bath faucet to clean my leg properly and put on some comfortable clothes. I made dinner, way too much, and now I‚Äôm full, sitting on my bed trying to procrastinate the homework I have that‚Äôs due at midnight. I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôll do it or not.

I feel so sick with myself. How I‚Äôm able to have so many extreme highs and lows in just hours. This is so draining.

I hope I can etch my plate nicely before the end of the weekend. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll do bad."

feeling empty and isolated. i don‚Äôt even remember taking my final this morning. i don‚Äôt care anymore.

i ate a fairly normal breakfast and lunch but i feel shitty about it. forget my stuff to work on on campus so i had to bike home in the cold. i‚Äôm numb figuratively and literally. there‚Äôs no coffee left in my house. i think that‚Äôs the worst part rn.

i think it took my about three months to realize completely that i‚Äôd made a mistake. not sure if i can last that long again waiting for you. i will never be able to let go the idea of you being with someone else. it hurts too much. at least my cat knows i‚Äôm alive."
0,"day 2 - morning thoughts (I have too many)
Morning thoughts.

Last night was rough. Everything seemed to be going well until I shut off the lights to try to get some sleep. I immediately just began picturing my ex-boyfriend with his new girl. I had a panic attack, smoked like 8 cigarettes, and fought the urge to get on my bike and drive into a semi. I slept a solid 20 minutes it feels like. I kept waking up and thinking of him.

It‚Äôs almost amazing how quickly my thoughts turn to him in the morning. It‚Äôs like hey - you‚Äôre up. Remember all this shitty stuff that happened to you? I hope you remember this all day and have a shitty life.

I just can‚Äôt get the thoughts of them out my head. It repulses me so much I actually get nausea. That was supposed to be me. We were supposed to be together forever. We had plans to get married and have children. We were attached at the fucking hip. We told each other everything, all our deepest, intimate secrets for the past 4.5 years. And you threw it away in a fucking instant over a FaceTime call.

Being in what was formerly a long distance relationship it‚Äôs a blessing and curse to not be in the same area. A curse because I feel like we had no real closure. We never talked in person about any of this. A blessing because I‚Äôm not at risk of seeing him or going over to his house.

I‚Äôm just trying to keep my head up. My last final is in 3 hours and since I woke up at 5am after sleeping for almost no time, I am going to try and look over my notes. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to focus. I need to calm down before I do anything. I don‚Äôt know if I even want to go take this exam. What‚Äôs the point?

No - I need to keep going. I can‚Äôt give up. I'm stronger than this. Keep fighting and I promise it will be better. You can live you‚Äôre life in sadness, regret, and misery or you can go through the hard work now and live contently. You did it once with your eating disorder, and even though you‚Äôve lived with depression for 11 years you can climb out of this hole. You didn‚Äôt initiate it - but you kept digging, but there‚Äôs a way out.

I am thinking about taking off on my family‚Äôs christmas in the evening to go see a singer at a bar. I‚Äôve been listening to her album on repeat pretty much since the breakup and it‚Äôs one of the things that has been keeping me sane. I think it would be really good for me to get out and go see her (In Loving Memory of When I Gave a Shit - LOLO is the album). I am just looking for something to keep me going. I feel like all of my coping is revolved around journaling like 20 times a day and doing technical things like coding. I wish I could focus on something mind numbing. Actually, I can - Tetris but I get so addicted to that game it‚Äôs scary. You can only play it so long before all you see are Tetris pieces. I like to play word games because at least they make you think. But I‚Äôll be damned if I end up sitting around playing computer games for the rest of my life to avoid my problems. I need to find some other things to do.

I think I‚Äôll take up knitting again. Knitting is incredibly relaxing. The problem is you need something to focus on in addition to knitting and sometimes that has to be your thoughts. Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing? It always helped me share more with my therapist - I think maybe because I didn‚Äôt have to look at them. I should remember this for my future relationships - always knit during difficult discussions haha. See - learning already?

Later I‚Äôve got some research stuff to do for my thesis. I‚Äôm not really looking forward to it. I was, but I always want to sit around and mope. My problem is my lab space is desolate so I‚Äôm locked in this shitty room alone. It seems like it‚Äôs going to be depressing and I‚Äôll just end up crying all day. Maybe I can find somewhere else to work - somewhere where there are more people around. I‚Äôm sure all the other grad students are taking off since it‚Äôs the last day of the term. Just wish I knew of someone who could keep an eye out on me. I do have two desks I guess I could go to the other one but I hate that one. It‚Äôs probably even more depressing than the desolate room. There‚Äôs too many sad grad students in there - but there‚Äôs always good food.

Speaking of, I ate dinner last night but felt like absolute shit about it. I woke up again dehydrated and hungry but I just don‚Äôt have the desire to eat. I know there‚Äôs some of my ED talking but I think a lot of it is just being depressed and losing my appetite. I wish I could eat before this exam and day ahead of me, but I don‚Äôt see that happening. I only have one apple left and it‚Äôs very small - I don‚Äôt want to buy food since I am going out of town for two weeks starting this weekend. My god, I can‚Äôt wait. I want to make plans to see some old friends. But they all drink and lot and many do drugs (I wasn‚Äôt an angel when I was younger - go figure) and it‚Äôs hard to be around that when you‚Äôre trying to stay sober. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic or drug addict but when I do things and I‚Äôm depressed they don‚Äôt end well. I‚Äôm just trying to avoid it altogether. My one good old friend is my high school sweetheart. We actually dated for 4 years, and so the breakup was similar. I attempted suicide shortly after but not this time. We‚Äôre on good terms now, so at least there‚Äôs some hope. We were hanging out my freshman year and he started to ask about what we were doing and I rejected him because I was so thrown off and scared. And now I think he‚Äôs afraid to hang out with me. Whenever I ask, he just straight up ignores it somethings. Always cancels. He‚Äôs socially awkward I understand but I kinda just gave up trying. I would like to see him because he keeps me sane and he‚Äôs a great person to talk to. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs going to happen. Maybe if I‚Äôm honest and tell him I could really use a friend right now.

My god apparently I have a lot of thoughts in the morning. I just want to write forever about everything. I want to write about how I am so pissed off that you‚Äôre seeing another woman. Jesus fuck, It‚Äôs so hard to deal with. I can‚Äôt believe I put you threw this and didn‚Äôt fucking realize it. If you say that you regret coming back to me after all this shit went down, then that‚Äôs good to know. Because maybe then I know not to go back to you if you ever want me to. It‚Äôs sad but I know I would go back to you. That‚Äôs why I want to keep up this NC (2.5 days now) so I can get over this. I originally had plans to message on Christmas just to say Merry Christmas but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea. I just need to let it go. Move on. Be content with ripping of the bandaid. Even though it felt like you were, you weren‚Äôt meant to be together.

The bad things.

I‚Äôm gonna write some of the things I didn‚Äôt like about the relationship to remind myself why I should be grateful for this breakup. 1) You were never in a good mood. Ever. Always cranky and negative. Even my roommate said you were cranky.

2) You never talked about yourself. You got angry with me that I didn‚Äôt listen, but you never had anything to say. I ask you about your day and you gave me nothing. I ask you about soccer and you give me nothing. Like just because I don‚Äôt understand soccer doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to listen to you talk about it for hours - I like listening to people talk about what they‚Äôre passionate about.

3) you weren‚Äôt passionate about anything *except* soccer. So I didn‚Äôt get to hear you talk, rant or vent about much of anything. You seemed to have no goals, aspirations or desires.

4) You didn‚Äôt have a real job. Actually, I don‚Äôt mind not having a real job. Bartending is a good job...if you love it. You complain about needing something more? Then go and fucking get it dude. No one is stopping you. Stop feeling sorry for yourself about you life choices and make a change.

5) We were both very depressed, suicidal, and lacked self-confidence. It‚Äôs difficult enough when one person is struggling, but to have two that can‚Äôt talk about their feelings is just fucked.

6) you rely on your parents for everything. I know they still send you money. You‚Äôre 24 - come on man. I haven‚Äôt taken a dime from my parents other than gifts since high school and even IN HIGH SCHOOL was giving money to my mom. Time to be a big boy.

7) we didn‚Äôt know how to have dates other than eating out. We never really did anything interesting together. We loved to lay in bed and go to restaurants, coffee shops, and sometimes even wine bars, but other than that we did nothing. No picnics, walks, anything. We could never agree and always just gave up.

8) you‚Äôre fucking addicted to your cell phone. Literally you would go to visit my mom with me and be on your phone the whole time. When I call you out, my mom sides with you? I think it‚Äôs just rude. You always had your phone on dates and couldn‚Äôt control yourself and actually made me take it away from you sometimes. And you‚Äôre just looking at shitty memes and twitter feeds. Like really - memes make you happier than me?

9) we had a shitty sex life. I really faded because I was in a lot of pain, but I feel like you tried way too hard and it was off-putting. It almost creeped me out. I was uncomfortable.

10) when we lived together, you didn‚Äôt chip in for food. I get it - your parents paid the rent (which was fucking shitty on me) but *you* personally did not have expenses. I would be absolutely fine paying for everything if you had offered to help. You never offered, you literally would ask me at the store if you could buy things. It‚Äôs like dude I‚Äôm not you‚Äôre fucking mother. Buy your own shit.

11) you complained about the things that were most important to me. I should have prioritized more, but I don‚Äôt really think you understand how important it is for me to be involved in the volunteer work I do. It keeps me sane, it helps me cope, and it gives me meaning. It is my purpose and I can‚Äôt not pursue it. I‚Äôm sorry that it requires me to travel, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to be gone all the time. It‚Äôs a compromise, but I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd like to compromise in the favor of me having meaning in my life. i was willing to compromise to - it wasn‚Äôt going to be longer than a month or so at a time of travel.

12) you never make up your mind. Just like the job thing, you can‚Äôt decide what you want. Where do you want to live? What should you do? Should you go back to school? Like I can‚Äôt actually believe you had the guts to tell me that it was *my* fault you couldn‚Äôt see a real future. You‚Äôre talking about MOVING to a country where I don‚Äôt speak the language and women aren‚Äôt exactly the most respected as engineers. I just wanted to travel for a few weeks at a time.

13) you get fixated on small issues. This mentally-ill person used to live next door to us and play the saxophone terribly. Yes, it was annoying. But some headphones in and shut up. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I heard him complain about that guy.

14) your money habits. It seemed like you were starting to improve, but I‚Äôm not positive. You went over $5,000 into credit card debt to buy yourself a computer to play games on. I have absolutely no problem at all with you buying a computer, in fact I think it‚Äôs a good thing when you have the fucking money. You spent and spent and like 70% of it is just on food. You continued to do things like (you probably still have) a gym membership you never use. like dude?? have some self-control. You‚Äôre parents still give you money and yet you still overspend on shit.

15) you changed your mind about kids. You‚Äôve always said you didn‚Äôt want them, and I thought we were on the same page that we never wanted biological children. I never want to give birth - just adopt. You agreed. then randomly one day you say you may want to have biological children? Like that‚Äôs kinda a big deal, dude.

16) when i finally did start really hanging out with people, you shit talk them. You shit talk my friends and accuse me of shit or make snarky comments. You friends pressured you to snort cocaine and mine are the problem?

17)  you never wanted to run with me, I get it - we‚Äôre not all runners, but i just wish it was something we could‚Äôve done together. The times we did go it was great but you always had an excuse.

18) \^\^ you always have an excuse.

19) you‚Äôre a hypocrite. you shit on my for being busy all the time and when you get busy (still not even as committed as I was, dude?!) you complain about your life and stop doing things with me, you didn‚Äôt prioritize me. you‚Äôre no different dude, face it.

20) your gifts always made me feel like you didn‚Äôt understand me. It would‚Äôve meant more to me for you not to give me a gift because you would‚Äôve understood minimalism. You literally just tried to show you could spend money. Over and over again.

21) I always knew you had a thing for one of our friends, but she‚Äôs in a committed relationship. I knew when you were crushing on people - you would flirt with them in front of me. Maybe you two ran off together. who cares at this point? good riddance.

That‚Äôs enough - I needed that. Especially kids and money. That shit it very important in life.

I also had a thought. I hope this new girl is a coworker - that shit always ends weird/bad.

I got over a lot of my anxiety by and large that I felt earlier in the day. Feeling ok now. School was shitty today. I got a lot of points off on my exam I got back today for a dumb reason, I don't even think what I put is wrong but I know the prof is super anal about this kind of stuff so I don't know if I will even bring it up. I also wrote a really harsh review for one of my profs today and I know they will know its me from the hand writing but I don't really care. I have a ton of different things to do this weekend for school and I just want to do none of it. I am also thinking of trying to find a job at my college and want to quit my job with kids because I am tired of the company. Alright, that's all for now. "

I woke up today again with another quite awful dream. I wrote it down in my notes app. The panic and exhaustion was too intense to capture at 7 when I finally got up to write it down before the dream faded. I still don‚Äôt know what it means...

‚ÄúAll of us were in this strange house on vacation I kept screaming dad dad dad dad over and over to get him to leave this maze of a building/house we were in. He didn‚Äôt respond, suddenly when I caught up to him he clutched his chest like it hurt really bad.
This random homeless dude passed us on the stairs. I awkwardly nodded and I should have given him the socks I was holding.
He jumped in front of us and like started changing clothes at his locker. I looked away. Then he went back to wear the garage door openers were. He closed one, I was able to roll through the bottom one before it closed completely and I got my fingers under the next one before he could trap me in there. I ran and hid in the front seat of our car in the driveway. I overheard them say to leave me out there, that the pain of knowing my family was suffering inside was enough.

Then I woke up‚Äù

I checked my phone. August posted something puzzling on his story about ‚Äústumbling over his words when talking about drawing cows with someone he kinda liked that he‚Äôd been excited for all day.‚Äù I reread all he had wrote 2-3 times. I have no idea who he could be talking about. I‚Äôm probably reading into it too much. He‚Äôs gay anyways, and I‚Äôm... me.

The art college I plan on attending‚Äôs continuing education Instagram page followed me. THEY FOLLOWED ME. Completely without warning or reason. I texted Milla and they already followed her and we shared this brief moment of extreme excitement.

I barely made it to school on time, had to run to Algebra. I worked with Sydney for the entire period. We talked about our Spotify Wrapped in the halls on the way to seminar. She‚Äôs so nice, and I don‚Äôt understand why she tolerates me, and even enjoys talking to me‚Äî we don‚Äôt have anything in common besides our names.

I listened to episode 107 of HBM in seminar and went to lunch afterwards. I ate my shitty pizza and left to sit in the hall outside of the painting room. I listened to music and was quite at peace being alone.

English passed, and then came art portfolio. I decided I wanted to let out this shit that‚Äôs been bothering me for so long but I can‚Äôt get myself not to smile when F, or any of my friends at my table are around. I kept rubbing my eyes making them puffy and red and pinched my nose and cheeks to look tired and distressed. No one said anything. Almost 40 minutes passed of me doing absolutely nothing at all, watching Logan draw as I usually do, and staring off into space, or at F just longing for him to see my eyes that were struggling to water up. I‚Äôm so fucking desperate and it‚Äôs disgusting and sad and makes me sick to write this down.

His marigold linoleum prints were set up at the place I sat. It was kind of in the way but I didn‚Äôt mind, I wasn‚Äôt doing anything anyways. Eventually F came over to work on finishing printing his block cut of a flower for his daughter. They were so good, the thought and time went into carving it is amazing. He loves his kids so much.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I wanted to shrink, I felt so large and yet so small with him standing right there. After a couple minutes of awkward conversation about future art club proceedings, I got up and left to the bathroom when someone else started talking to him. I banged my head on the wall a few times and came back to class quickly. I don‚Äôt remember much of exactly what he said mostly because I was so so so awkward and quiet and on the verge of tears and after a brief silence he casually said, ‚ÄúSo what have you made today ‚Äî‚Äî-?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt lie, I said nothing. It was such an odd question but so profound. I hadn‚Äôt made anything today, or yesterday, or the day before. I felt ashamed and embarrassed and like a failure, especially to him.

He asked about my copper plate that he‚Äôd gone to all the trouble to cut for me. I had posted on my story yesterday about it mocking me from the across the room. The plate is too perfect and my drawing skills are so clumsy. I told him the truth on why I hadn‚Äôt done anything to it yet.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. My phone was almost dead, I didn‚Äôt want to leave, I just wanted to sit there forever at that table with my friends and him just talking and making art forever and class came to an end and I left and went to FRLNCR.

It was awkward once again. I was already depressed and still on the verge of tears for not being able to show my pain great enough to F. God it sounds so stupid to say that. I don‚Äôt like FRLNCR, I really only went in hopes that I could talk to Lilah or Milla. It was awful again. I critiqued another one of Angela‚Äôs endlessly numerous pieces of mediocre art. It was awful I felt like such a snob. I left at 3:30 to go sit on the stairs outside and maybe F would wave to me when he left to go pick up his son. When I got down to the art hall. He had just locked his door and was walking out to go to his car and he said hi real quick and asked why I was still hanging around, but he kind of answered himself by asking if I was just waiting for my dad. I said yeah and bye and I ran to go sit on the stairs.

He drove by not soon after and waved to me. I tried my very fucking best to show my pain without overtly crying or being too happy and waving back. I gave him the fucking depressed smile I give and I think he might have looked concerned for the first time in a while. I hope so, and that I just didn‚Äôt read his face wrong.

It was too cold so I ran to the front of the building and talked to Athena while I waited for dad to pick me up. I got home and after a little while pulled down my leggings and sliced up my legs quite a bit. I didn‚Äôt feel direct anger or sadness like I had earlier. Things were just kind of numb. By the time they had stopped bleeding and it was safe to put my pants over them I ate dinner and we left for the church Christmas concert.

It was fine. The man at my table asked me what I wanted to do in college. I don‚Äôt know why I froze up and said my dumbass ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I honestly don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt honest. Am I subconsciously scared of what people at church will think about art school? Ugh.

Now It‚Äôs already 9:30 and I haven‚Äôt started on my AP research at all. I still hate this project with a passion. On top of that my outside reading is due for English tomorrow at midnight. I‚Äôll figure this all out somehow. I hope.

I need a miracle. God help me and my fucked up head.

Edit: after posting this I had a good cry while scrolling through moms old facebook.
I miss her so much it hurts so bad I want to hug her and play another game of Chinese checkers or keep her company while we wait for dinner to cook or walk with her around the trail at the park. I want to dance in the rain with her and sit alone on her porch watching the sunset. I want more visits to the book store or to any store. I miss or adventures and or heartfelt conversations. I miss her so much, every ounce of me hurts. It‚Äôs not fair I never got to say goodbye. I had no warning. I‚Äôm sorry mom. "

Morning thoughts.

Today I woke up and for two seconds was really happy in moving forward in recovery. Then I remembered my boyfriend left me and probably spent the night with another woman.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night and I cancelled my group study session for my final tomorrow (whoops I should probably study at some point). I also called off a trip to a winery because I don‚Äôt think I should be drinking in my state. I didn‚Äôt eat anything yesterday and the day before I only had an apple. I told myself I would start clean at breakfast tomorrow, but I made toast and can‚Äôt seem to eat it.

I think the biggest issue with not being able to eat is that I‚Äôm not allowing myself to run because of it. Running is a really big coping mechanism for my anxiety and depression, but obviously not for my eating disorder. So I can‚Äôt run unless I eat. But I often can‚Äôt eat until I run. It‚Äôs a cycle. But I am incredibly dehydrated this morning and shouldn‚Äôt run. In fact, I probably shouldn‚Äôt go to my study session because I would have to bike anyway.

I know I should actually study for this final, but I have literally 100% in that class. I am a perfectionist to the point where it is very unhealthy in terms of grades. I turned in a take home exam yesterday that wasn‚Äôt my best work on purpose. I can‚Äôt keep killing myself over the details. I need to *learn* what I can and accept the grades I get. I know that I am intelligent and what really matters is that I can use what I am learning. When I was recovery from my eating disorder the first time, I intentionally would do worse on homework and exams and allowed myself to get B‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt study for the ACT at all and still managed to get accepted to college and an engineering degree. So suck on that perfectionist America and the pressure we put our children under. I felt way better for it. So I‚Äôve decided to not kill myself over this exam, and let my actual priorities take precedence (my priorities are my health, and my relationship with my family/cat obviously).

Tomorrow I have plans to keep myself busy with some research for my thesis. It‚Äôs not every technical work, just organizing and I love that. May look into some data but nothing overly strenuous. I think I should ask a friend to get coffee in the evening. Saturday I am thinking of taking advantage of the predicted sunny 51-degree weather and take this hike I have been wanting to do forever - just gotta eat to be able to do it. I might invite my brother and maybe we can get breakfast together so it makes eating easier. I‚Äôm going to go to the library and check out a few books that have been on my list forever and keep myself occupied reading. I need to make a plan before my flight on Sunday to visit my grandma on Sunday or I‚Äôll be in a terrible state. My first live therapy session is Monday, and I am also learning how to dance country-western with my grandma and her partner is going to take us to show off a country bar...literally what did I get myself into haha.

Midday Thoughts.

The good thing about the past is that it is just that - the past. It doesn‚Äôt need to be the future.

It sat in the toaster for about an hour but I did eat my toast. I also made a list of things to keep me occupied and I‚Äôm really excited. I‚Äôve been wanting to put together some code to simplify a few calculations and analyses so I‚Äôm going to get started working on those. I also have a ton of things I have been wanting to do to support a nonprofit I‚Äôm involved in so I‚Äôm going to collect some data and do some volunteer work. I am also thinking of completing some online courses just to keep my mind occupied. I am prepping to potentially speak a conference about some undergraduate research I did that is very controversial. I‚Äôm putting together that presentation and the abstract to submit and hopefully I‚Äôll be able to share a much needed perspective.

I told my mom about restarting therapy and I am grateful she is supportive. She‚Äôs known way longer than I have that I need to get back on this path. Mom‚Äôs are very wise.

Evening Thoughts.

Cigarettes and dehydration is not a good mix. I had more toast and even ordered some takeout because there‚Äôs nothing in my house since I am leaving this weekend for almost two weeks. I didn‚Äôt eat much of it though. I actually studied a little and my brain was super focused and it was pretty easy to problem-solve.

Some times it gets easier - I think the nights are generally easier. I get random spurts of thinking about my boyfriend with someone else and feel sick. I find comfort in pretending he is also sad AF and that he wants to talk to me even though it‚Äôs probably not true. I can‚Äôt accept that yet but hopefully in a little while.

0,"Ups, and infinite downs
I can't remember the last time I woke up and just looked at the sunlight streaming into my room, and felt happy in my heart.

&#x200B;

The last time I felt butterflies. Or just lay in bed thinking how lucky I am and how happy I am.

&#x200B;

I'm so sick of being fucked over and ignored by people I put trust into.

&#x200B;

I can't stand the thought that a guy loved me once more than anything and when I grew to love him too, he broke up with me after two years. It's fucking twisted. It's fucking twisted to be lured in like that and to realize what is in front of your eyes only to have it taken away. After almost the first year of our relationship blossomed a long distance relationship that made me feel like my future had a direction, him. It would all be okay, I could crawl into his lap someday soon and rest against him. I could slip the ring he gave me onto my finger and tie the knot. Have two beautiful kids. A traditional family. A life I never knew I wanted. He brought out so much good in me.

&#x200B;

2018 has felt like a parallel universe. I want my old life back. I want him back. I want to stop carrying around so much negativity and baggage for fucking once in the past months. It's getting exhausting. I want it to fucking end. I hate having emotions these days. They're bothersome and complicate everything.

&#x200B;

It's my stupid naivity and emotions that let somebody get so close to me and have a firm grasp on my heart. And for what? To wake up one day and be broken up with. Like that. Nothing else. No warning. No signs.

&#x200B;

I don't know how good of a person I am. I don't know what I should have in life. I don't think I deserve much at all, to be honest. I'm not a good person.

&#x200B;

But this? Wouldn't wish this on someone I despised. Nobody deserves to go to bed everynight and wake up feeling monumental worthlessness and loneliness. Friends are fine, but you know damn well there's a gap only that one person can fill, and beyond that you have to walk around with this gaping hole where they should be.

&#x200B;

Shame on me for thinking this would work. There's so much pain these days I'd almost honestly want to go so far as to say fuck you, fuck what you did to me, fuck your emotions, and fuck our relationship. It was better to be single and completely loveless than to put up with this much pain in day to day life. I don't know about this payoff. Being happy for what is ultimately a few months in my whole lifespan thinking my life would work out and we could work out was great, but for the endless torment I'm going to have to deal with I should've just fucking never met you.

Alright, time to do another post real quick. This is for yesterday! I had quite the rough day with bad thoughts and stuff. I also made some rough choices and felt a lot of anxiety about it this morning because I had a weird dream where I was texing some other girl but keeping it a secret from Her. But I feel like I need to stay calm and learn to let things pass and not berate myself over it. I am still doing well in the grand scheme of things I feel. I am really tired right now. Also, I did no hw yesterday which is bad. I did a little bit this morning so that's good. I emailed my supervisor yesterday and then She later sent an email to the whole companing basically adressing my email."

I woke up wanting to die. And I woke up with a strange and emotionally horrifying and draining dream. I wrote it down in the notes app this morning:


‚ÄúWe went to Wendy‚Äôs for dinner like we do on Wednesday but we keep seeing F every time we go out to dinner. I think my dad hates F. I was worried, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge I was there. I felt like a stalker, but this time it wasn‚Äôt my own doing, it was complete chance we‚Äôd seen each other at the same restaurant every Wednesday for the last three weeks. For some reason we were sitting at the same table. I don‚Äôt know why. Then my dad suddenly goes. ‚ÄúSo, how do you like living in a cult of art‚Äù (something like that)
And F responds quite rudely, ‚ÄúHow do YOU like being in a cult?‚Äù
I was freaking out. August was there for some reason, I went over to him by the drink machine and told him what happened.

I can‚Äôt believe my head invents this crap. I can‚Äôt believe my subconscious would make my view of someone I care about nasty and disgusting like that. Jesus.‚Äù


After analyzing it I totally get where it got it‚Äôs cult roots from and why August was there. But what really worried me is the blatant rudeness of F. Ugh. But I need to remember it‚Äôs just a dream and F would never do anything like that because he is a pure and wholesome and perfect person.

I got to school and sat in my normal spot and was actually able to make myself cry because I miss being able to hug mom. I don‚Äôt know if F saw me from that far across the room or not, but either way I didn‚Äôt care.

We watched half of the Great Gatsby in US History this morning. I went to seminar and talked with Brooklyn. It was so hard hiding my arm from her, I really shouldn‚Äôt wear short sleeves when my scars are still red. Especially around her when she kind of noticed them the previous week. I wish the big ones would just disappear.

I went down to lunch like usual and get in line at precisely the right time so that F comes into the cafeteria like I always do. Got my shitty chicken and potatoes and was punching in my student number when F was like ‚ÄúHey S, cool shoes‚Äù UGH. I really shouldn‚Äôt have worn my ugly ass shiny mirror shoes from last year. I hate people noticing me as if the 6ft, overweight, art kid who wears too much mismatching denim doesn‚Äôt already get enough attention. I want to shrink. I told F that I sarcastically hated my shoes and I shouldn‚Äôt have worn them at all in the first place. He said they were cool and laughed and left. Great, as if I couldn‚Äôt be more awkward.

I was walking over to the other side of the cafeteria to get ketchup like I always did, I followed not that far behind F. I was getting my ketchup when I said hi to Ava standing at the microwave we chatted a few words and I was about to leave and she straight up goes, ‚Äúwhat happened to your arm?‚Äù I panicked and almost immediately blurted out ‚Äúoh just the cats‚Äù just fucking that. And ran off back to my table. I wanted to die but I didn‚Äôt cry and I wasn‚Äôt too worried. I thought Mr. H was looking at me later but it was probably just paranoia.

Art Club was okay. Not good, not horrible either. As I predicted no one brought their carved blocks and I printed out my shitty emo af block of my hands over my face and they turned out bad. I think F was just still bummed about the field trip, which was by the way canceled for us tomorrow. I guess it‚Äôs a good thing but I was hoping I got F‚Äôs van again like last week. August is such a nice kid, we don‚Äôt have MUCH in common but I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs so genuinely nice to me and it‚Äôs really sweet of him. I feel so awkward and fat around everyone and especially him for some reason. Gonna go on another purge this week.

Nothing really planned for next weeks club but F mentioned something about doing art with local disabled children which sounds fun. Hopefully.

I got home, I‚Äôm kind of worried the car rides with dad and I are getting too awkward, I can‚Äôt let him see I‚Äôm depressed, especially if someday he finds out about the self harm, I don‚Äôt want him to actually realize I was sad. We got home and I talked to Alex C briefly and posted a bit on my story and then sliced up my leg a bit. I‚Äôm kind of mad that I didn‚Äôt cut as deep as yesterday but that was a shit show and scared me really bad. I guess it‚Äôs for the best that I don‚Äôt. But I want to.

Church was fine.

I guess in reflection that today was just kind of boring. I hate boring. I want days to be extremely happy or super sad or else I feel like I didn‚Äôt LIVE enough that day. I want to cry like I did a week or few weeks ago but I can‚Äôt bring myself to anymore, especially not around F which is so annoying because I want him to see I‚Äôm in pain but he just makes me so happy it‚Äôs hard to not smile.

Someday I‚Äôll get this shit that‚Äôs been bogging me down off my chest and I can finally work on making beautiful art and having good friendships..


Edit: oH yeah and Milla texted me and we decided we should hang out with River sometime. I haven‚Äôt hung out with anyone from school in 5 years, it‚Äôs been so long and I was so happy I wanted to cry. "

So guy I've been talking to says he needs to be alone for a bit. I'm all for giving space. But 2 things

1) I'm worried about him. Hope hes ok. I know hes been going through some rough stuff and hes against suicide. But still makes me worried.
2) it's the first day/night in over a month we haven't talked. And it feels so weird. Instantly feeling that crushing lonely feeling. I just got off the phone with my mom and we talked for over an hour but as soon as I hung up, the silence has just been overwhelming.

I've heard 100 times that I shouldn't depend on others for my happiness but making others happy is where I get my joy from. I find myself already wanting to  start looking back online just to have contact and I know and acknowledge that isn't right. But I just really hate being all by myself.

I'm losing this guy and I can't really help it. And the one reason hes disappearing is cause and effect. Shit confidence, he hates it, leaves, causes more shit confidence.

Idk what to do. Just going to go back to fake it till I make it.

I dont feel good either... and today WAS such a good day..."

Im so sorry if this isnt the best place for this question, but I didnt know where else to go. Everyone keeps telling me it could help a lot if i start a journal/diary of some sorts. After a very long stressful day ive got about 10 pages back and forth dated December 5th in the begining of a quite hefty 5 star notebook. My question is, what do i do with this notebook once its full? Do people keep their journals to reflect on possibly later in life? I just dont quite understand the point I guess."
0,"Garbage post. Just getting out my thoughts.
I'm constantly feeling like I'm not enough. And though I've been working on my confidence, and have made huge improvements, I'm about to lose (again) a great potential relationship because of my lack of confidence. Which brings my confidence down because I've been working on it but its still not enough. It's like a vicious snowball effect. And I know: if this guy really cared, I wouldnt feel this way. But he's been helping me and he makes me feel more relaxed and stress free than I've ever felt. And we hit it off so well and then suddenly it all crashed and burned. I dont know what to say to him or what to do. He had some thoughts about me not liking sex that I told him were very wrong so I'm wondering if maybe these thoughts of low confidence are wrong too. I love who I am. I am working on loving what I look like (both in acceptance and physical changes). So overall, I'm happy with me. I'm just bad at projecting that I guess. It's like everyone in my past has torn me down so now I'm left picking myself back up... why is confidence so important in a SO anyways? I dont look for 1 thing in particular because each person has qualities to balance themselves out. If one has low confidence but is an genuinely nice person; or if they get angry fast but calm down just as quickly... everything balances. Plus, some people have too much confidence and become cocky and arrogant and I hate that.

Idk. Just feel like I'm always going to be battling this because nobody wants to give me a chance..."

I put the wrong month in yesterday, I guess that says a lot about what I‚Äôm feeling now. November flew by and now finals are around the bend. I‚Äôm not prepared. I don‚Äôt want to do school work, I just want to daydream and stare out my window at night watching the cars go by. I want to listen to the sounds my house makes and listen to new music and learn all the words. I want to watch a good movie and cry and pick at the scabs from my healing cuts. I want to mourn my mom but I can‚Äôt find the tears, I‚Äôve picked over every memory to cry to.

God I sound so emo.

What happened to me? What happened to my faith? Have I lost it completely? Has my family noticed?

I don‚Äôt want to think about it so I push the thought of God and my faith out. It hurts too much to think about.

Today was so average. Too typical. I thought I‚Äôd be done with having anxiety about my grades before finals, but I gave up on my grades when I realized that my artistic abilities matter more than my GPA in the college I plan on attending.

F introduced or next project, ‚ÄúArt as social commentary‚Äù

Great. üôÑ

I want to work hard on this one but I‚Äôm not sure I have the time or drive to do so. I‚Äôll end up doing the bare minimum and leave a barely mediocre picture of myself in F‚Äôs mind. I‚Äôve begun to already expect less of myself when around him so I don‚Äôt end up crying and cutting myself every when I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve been my best self. I already can see a future vision of me nervously saying bye per usual and crying as soon as I leave the art room after my final leaving my winter break sour.

But maybe it will be good. I hope, I need a creative boost this Dec and Jan if I want to get a full/large scholarship to the PCAL.

...

Alex C posted a beautiful video on his insta, I commented and he DMed me and we caught up very briefly. It was so good to talk to him, we hadn‚Äôt talked since April before mom died and sent me down this rabbit hole to hell. He has so much talent and I‚Äôm so happy for him when I see him succeed! He is such a rarity in today‚Äôs teens, I don‚Äôt like him but I do, not romantically, but just as a friend and someone who genuinely cares about his wellbeing.

These emotional rollercoasters of days are starting to get to me. Going from cutting my thighs deeper than I have before to catching up with an old friend who made me filled with joy takes a toll on me. If I‚Äôm not feeling anything intense I feel worthless and numb.

I want things to change ever so slightly, maybe I‚Äôll pray, maybe I‚Äôll work on my Independent Project, maybe I‚Äôll listen to some Black Pistol Fire. But I am NOT doing my homework.

Who knows.

Looking forward to Art Club tomorrow ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"Starting over.
""You seem so happy and calm. What happened?""

&#x200B;

A breakup. Two years. Romance for the first time. The strongest feelings I've ever felt my entire life. The strongest I've ever known.

The deepest unconditional love. From both sides. A ring. An engagement?

All broken off, and for what?

I can't start over. I don't need to explain my erratic behavior to another person, another lover. I don't need to look into a new set of eyes and find trust, comfort, honesty. It won't happen. I want it to, but it won't.

I gave you everything I had, everything I was, and I thought I knew you and us, what we wanted, what you wanted.

I was wrong, and now I'm alone just like before, but worse. Paranoia. Anxiety. What's happening next?

The absence of the ring on my finger is one that slices deep into whatever I have left of a heart.

You don't need me anymore, and I'm starting not to need you, but it'll take some time. So go on, find a new lover. Treat her half as good as you treated me and you'll have yourself a wife.

Thanks for everything. Even if I feel like just jumping into a frozen river and staying there would be infinitely less painful than the hell I am currently in. Enjoy yourself.  We're young.

So to answer your question, I'm not calm. I'm not happy. I have to act that way. If I don't and I am my true self every time you try to interact with me now, you're going to fully be out of my life overnight. I wish terrible fucking things for you for a split second and then all I want is for you to find a nice girl.

I guess that's how breakups work. I thought I'd know by now.

I thought I mattered a bit. But I don't think I do anymore.

&#x200B;

I feel invalid. I feel wild. I feel emotional. Things that should never be happening are happening. I don't matter enough to one person to feel like I matter at all.

&#x200B;

When things happen I want to spill it to someone, that one person you can tell everything to because I need someone like that but even he has his own things to deal with. Even he probably won't understand. The people I have around me are nice, sure, but if I told them any of the emotions I have sometimes nobody would get it. I would get a pat on the shoulder. A ""there, there."" Nobody cares. Everyone is taking care of themselves. I need help. I want to be taken care of. I want to put my head on a chest at the end of the day and just sob.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of wet pillows.

&#x200B;

I just want to be cared for. I want to be told that as irrational as my feelings are, that they're ok. I don't have to feel bad, or guilty. It's okay. But nobody's here anymore. Nobody. I stick my neck out when I can and do what I can for people but nobody cares. I put others above myself as much as I can but nobody cares. I just want someone, something. I want peace.

i went to the gas station job to do my training and turns out they havent officially put me on the schedule. i wanted to wait for the store owner to arrive to talk to him so i just sat behind the count playing on my phone while customers come and go. i saw a few of the guys from the car wash job, including the manager. it felt awkward but i put on a fake niceness.  the manager acted like he was happy for me that i was working there but it was just a front. i waited 4 hours before the store owner finally showed up. i asked him when i can start training and he just looked at and asked the girl that works there who am i and how old i was. then he went in the office in the backroom and never came back out. that irritated me so i left. i stopped by my grocery job and asked the manager confirming my vacation days. when i talked to her she had a big attitude and was very rude. that hurt my feelings and ruined my day. she really changed on me. i thought she loved me. i guess not anymore. i really need to find another job. i keep getting fucked around by these no good managers. im off from work tomorrow so ill be at the library with my laptop. i wish there was a temp job that can pay me by the day instead of just working for the whole week. i could use the extra money. nothing is going good for me man..."

Field trip was canceled today, but I was able to finish my zine about bones in the time we would have been on the field trip. I‚Äôm not disappointed, I‚Äôve been before so it‚Äôs alright.

F read my zine in club today and liked it, although I‚Äôm pretty sure he liked ‚Äúhow to brainwash the feeble‚Äù more. It makes me kind of sad, but if I‚Äôll be honest with myself I like it more too. F shares stuff with me that is just so pure, like how he loves to pick up his son every day from school, or simple things like that.

But I feel this deficit in this relationship of a sort of mutual respect we have. I think he likes me more as a person now but I want my artistic skills to be as great as who I am. Sounds narcissistic, but I can‚Äôt really describe what I‚Äôm trying to say.

He gave me a copper plate to etch onto. I had high hopes, I‚Äôm sure he does too. This beautiful piece of copper awaiting a masterpiece. But yet again the skills I think I have are way higher than the ones I actually possess.

I want to make a beautiful print for my PCAL portfolio, but I keep struggling with drypoint etching, it‚Äôs not the same as a pen, the pen is perfect, but the payoff of a good print is indescribable.

I gave up now. I‚Äôll try tomorrow if I get a chance. All I want to do anymore is listen to rock and cut off the scabs on my thighs. I no longer feel the cuts, but I can feel scabs, which is good enough.

I just want the skills to draw what I see..

I miss mom too, but not enough. I push the thought out of my head the second it tries to enter. I maybe watered up once today. Not good enough, I just want to cry. Maybe I‚Äôm addicted to intense emotions, but I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore.

And must have been during...I remember there's a note on pizza, and for the time you got your watch returned by Dr howcaniforgethername...hm was it 2015... I will always sigh about a time machine, right. You remember that LPT 'you think about major changes in your life, but of you get a time machine to go back and change something , it would be only some minor change you should be doing and so blablabla ' . I don't want to spoil it but that minor thing isn't just some minor thing for which we would go back in time. Its the point of butterfly effect. I can identify two such points in my life ( pls dear if you are reading this later don't try to recall - the past is in the past) ..maybe 3points, but f-u-c-k-i-t.

Fuck it all.

Now to the moments that made you happy-

-Mato Jelic's intro

- gazele's sister's chatter which your brother is fond of . And her recalling it today , Dec 2018

- that guy's tight ass that made you come up with that pick up line. Dec 2018. India gate.

- Spy kids movie

- songs by the midnight

- the mess , you complemented the guy on Diwali food and he's been really nice. Nov 2018

- Laurid? On pubg . A kid that taught you a different way to play , and to see things. And his cute voice 'come,come'

- times spent at your friend. Aug 2018. Nice food. Movie. Pubg. Shopping. Fuck I forgot the most important thing....rides. her friends were cute too

- your another friend. Sept 2018. Spending time with her. Her nice apartment facing the farm. Your walk there and you feeling poopy. üòÄ

- your brother's friend. Talkative one talking stories, made you want to belong here

- mess, cute wife, cute, her son

-tibetan guys et all - feeling optimistic and hopeful

- that baby's smile-ing . Waiting on metro . Nov 2018.

- the kind old man....watch....Kesar..

-dummdaaa Vidya's, esp about the teetotaller boi

-while you were practicing handwriting. It brings back your mojo

- the biriyani. It was yummy üò≠ sept 2018

- you made yummy noodles 2018 summer

- tea with Dr Abhishek

Had a bit of anxiety today but not too much, bit of bad thoughts too. Feel like I had more positive and good thoughts about Her overall though. W hung out and watched tv all day which was fun. We also cleaned a bit and popped over to the store for a second. We watched 13 episodes of Dr. Who today. Time pretty well spent I felt. We just finished the Rory and Amy arc and now I see no point in continuing to watch the show. I also don't understand the new companion Clara. The first few episodes you see her in (dalek episode and Christmas special) she actually seems to have a bit of character to her, but that seems to be lacking in the first few episodes of the actual season so far.

wow last month of 2018. this year went by too fast. i found a 2nd job at a gas station and my sister in law is against. she keep saying things like im soft, not tough and quiet. yes its true but damn quit saying that shit  its making me mad.  ill be getting some pepper spray to keep myself safe. i sent the manager my schedule from my grocery job and he hasnt gotten back to me. i hope he doesnt start fucking with me like the car wash manager did. my schedule for next week is bare. my hours was cut real bad. if the guy doesnt respond then im not taking the job. i dont have time for games.

i dont want to tell my family about my schedule because they always give me shit. when the neighbor comes over with the pepper spray my sister in law will drive me up the fucking wall. she is so irritating. i just want the lesson over with so she can shut the fuck up.

i deleted my tinder app. it wasnt working out so ill have to find another way to meet guys. maybe ill give my coworker a moment. he is older, only 43 and is sooo annoying to everyone but i feel this magnetism towards him. i felt him up in the bathroom a few times and it was wonderful. he has an amazing ass im in love with. im getting hard just thinking about it. he is my guilty pleasure. one of these days we have to have another sensual session. soon we should get naked and have sex.

i started a new profile on the fake leafgreen. i felt worried so i started fire red on the myboy emulator. that way i can have a full save file to make me feel better when the save file on the fake game get deleted. emulators are a life saver.

i am soooo tired. Today was the busiest day of work that I have worked since I started this job back in March. Whew, what a day. It helped the time go by I guess. We didn't make much at all in tips though given how busy we were. Had/have some anxiety about that past today but that doesn't do anyone any good. I need to look into learning to forgive myself. Anyways, Her and I went and toured an apartment and She didn't like it one bit and kept saying how She hated and didn't want to live in a small town and we had to and She had no choice and it was my fault and I thought all of that was completely unreasonable and unfair. I told Her that and She said She was just joking but She wasn't. Her mood did lighten up though after I reminded Her that it's what people do, move somewhere that is mutually beneficial to both of them and that I moved to our last two places with no complaints solely for Her work. It frustrated me quite a bit actually. I am not trying to make a bigger deal out of it. I played some video games a bit when I got home. Some of us were going to play together but one of them went AFK like right as everyone was ready, like, why even ready up then? That annoyed me. Did a bit of cleaning, She just got done organizing the closet. I am going to take a shower and sleep, might play one game first though.

I bought and played a new video game for a bit which I enjoy. I can really see myself sinking way too much money into it tbh :p but I don't think I have the funds to afford that right now. Her and I watched an episode of Dr. Who together, two episodes actually. They were both pretty enjoyable over all. I am tired now and ready to go to bed.

Alright, so I think my last post might have been a bit more than a week ago. I think I am going to roughly try and summarize my days. Alrighty, Thanksgiving was a good day I felt. I got to see my brother and one of my cousins that I haven't seen in a while. It was quite nice. Everyone just mostly talked which was good. My brother seems to be doing well and he seemed to have a little glow about him when he started to talk about his work and stuff so I am happy for him. I ate some yummy food, but I think I did an alright job with not eating too much. She gossiped about work stuff which is nice, I was glad to see Her not just sitting alone and not talking. After that we went up north to see Her family for the holidays. We got to sleep in the basement which is always the best. In the morning everyone eventually showed up and we played some board games that we brought with us that everyone enjoyed. The gift exchange went well. I got a cool new board game about growing trees and a Mcree funko pop, and a huuuuge bag of candy which I ate all of in like 2 days :p She also got a new board game that was soooooo fun. It was a good day. We had tacos for dinner. The next day we stayed the whole day even though we originally planned on leaving on Saturday. It was nice though, I felt a little guilt about it because I really needed to get some work done, but I think it was worth it overall. We left on Sunday pretty early. I was worried Her dog that was ridding with us might go to the bathroom in my car but I guess she was just having some anxiety. We got home and I don't remember what we did then. We either went to the store the day after or on Saturday. Sunday I really needed to start on my paper but I know I didn't. I did do the majority of my other project that day though so I was a bit productive. Monday I worked both jobs and studied for some exams and finished the rest of my project. Tuesday is the day that I finally actually started working on my paper. It had to be 10 pages and was due at midnight on Thursday so I had my work cut out for me. I let my anxiety get the best of me and cried about it, but I was able to get either 2 or 3 pages done. The next day I woke up early and got a few more pages done before class started and I felt a lot better about it then. I also worked a bit more on it that night and got to around 8 pages. I made some poor choices about bad thoughts and stuff on Wednesday, I just need to accept it, reflect upon it, and move on. Oh, I also had exams Wednesday and Thursday but I felt like they both went really well. Thursday, I finished my rough draft of my paper. I read it over and thought it was alright. I had my girlfriend review it for grammatical content and She hated me for it. :p I think I plan on doing some chores around the house before She gets home/once She's here to make it up to Her. She also made me dinner the past two nights which is nice of Her. She is the best. I didn't have to go to my other job today which I liked. I hope the person is alright, I didn't go because they were sick. But it feels nice to just have the rest of the day off. Wish I didn't have to go and work in the morning though. I will post again later tonight. I would like to do some chores and take an online quiz I need to take today. Alright, that's all for now!"

Alright, that's all for now. I think I ate under my calories for the day, not sure honestly. Don't want to work tomorrow, but life goes on! :)"

the last couple of days being 25 feels like nothing. everything is the same and i still have a childlike mindset.  my pokemon fever is still high but slightly went down when my gba sp stopped charging. i still have my original gba but the sp version is for when i want to play in the dark. they have replacement batteries for cheap on ebay so ill look into that. i wanted to get another original gba model just because. i like those more because they take double A batteries so they last longer than lithium  batteries. im playing heartgold now to make up for lost cause despite the fact that the game is hard af due to aloot of grinding.  i been feeling this rage inside of me again. its hard to feel joy and i am having thoughts and imagination of me telling people off and cursing them out for their behavior. in a way i like those thoughts but it gets me riled up and as im writing this im feeling the anger. i wish i could make it go away. it means i have to force positive thoughts.  its bad luck to have anger because more shitty things can happen.

im still on the whisper app in hopes of finding a guy to hump on in the bathroom. there is the light skin black guy i see at the library every day and he got a little nice booty i could feel on. i dont know if he is  gay and i dont want to offend him.i wouldnt mind grinding on his thighs.  maybe ill have a little luck today. i might help with the anger im feeling.

Alright, time for kind of joint big post I think for the past few days. Overall the past couple of days have been pretty good. Had some issues this morning with some bad thoughts and a bit throughout the day but nothing else much for the day, which is good. I had a good amount of anxiety throughout the week with some dumb stuff but I feel alright now. I have been dieting pretty well and my exams and stuff for school went well yesterday. I had the day off today and did some homework that I just got done, I also played some games and did a few errands that I needed to get done before tomorrow. Not a bad day overall and overall a good week. Her and have been hanging out more lately in general which is good. She asked if I wanted to watch something with Her on Sunday and I initially told Her no but I realized the error of my ways because She doesn't often feel like doing stuff together and we ended up watching more Dr. Who. I am enjoying this show so far, to my pleasant surprise! I wouldn't mind watching some more right now actually. Alright, that's all for now. Happy thoughts and staying positive! Got to get on top of these posts too. "

last couple of days been annoying. this weekend i went out to eat with my other family members and i ended up paying $30 for a meal. that left me dry broke until payday. i was not too happy about that.  i dont want to take money out my savings account. im trying to stay on track of saving.  as for work, it been sooo irritating. i am so done with the car wash job so im looking for a 2nd. a coworker has a job at a gas station and said they were hiring. the manager said he need someone for evenings and that the job is super easy. they pay under the table which gave me reminder of the car wash job. i dont want to work for 10 minutes only to be sent home just because its slow.  I dont trust these under the table paying job. the guy said he would give me a call if they want. so far they didnt so i guess i didnt get the job. at my grocery store job, my two bosses was a pain in the ass. one had a bad attitude and was a complete bitch to me and the other was just rude. yesterday they picked on me and gave me hell all because i liked another manager more than them. when i punched out i practically dashed out the store. my feelings were hurt so i was in my feelings after that and today. im off thankfully and if they try to call me in i will not answer the phone or respond to text. i didnt like how the head manager was a bitch to me. plus she tried to start stuff between and another coworker that works in the customer service. the girl that works in the customer service basically told me off and to keep her name out her mouth.  if the head boss keeps it up i might just quit or request a transfer to another store. she is already known for changing on people and terrorizing them until they quit.  she said she loves me but i dont know. it shows how quick a person can change if you get on their bad side.  i wanted to vent to someone about it but no one will understand or just laugh at me. on other notes, the pokemon sapphire i ordered came in. it is the authentic one so now i can migrate to the ds games.  i also been playing ruby on my phone and pc so i can feel better if the cartridge games battery saves go bad.  i will be looking online for gba backup tools and everdrives so i can move my save files between devices and keep them in the clouds. google clouds that is."

You ever have one of those weeks. Well... I'm having one now. Sunday night I went to sleep feeling the whole classical depression signs. You know, don't want to eat, don't want to move, feeling nothing but a tinge of sadness somewhere.  It took me a while to get to sleep and when I did, well... I didn't really wake up till like Monday afternoon / night. It was a restless sleep but there.

Oh I also forgot to take my antidepressants so that's a thing. Well I didn't forget I just slept through the normal time And didn't want to take them.

Tuesday was more of the same I guess but I woke up earlier went to bed midday ish. Did a few chores.  Felt a little better.

Today is Wednesday morning and we'll after my amazing week I found out the place I've meant to be moving into fell through and my heart has sunk to the point I want to burn myself again. I already wanted to this weekend or maybe earlier in the week (I can't tell) but...

There's also the fact my literal only friend is filled to anxiety and isn't feeling right. My father in all his wisdom is making me feel... He bitches too much like OMFG I DON'T CARE SHUT UP.

I'm going to try sleep since I haven't really slept at all.

P.S.
After what SWIM went through with the tramadol last week they'd take more right now. Even with all the shit they went through and the uneasyness. But they don't have any more pills to abuse.  "

Levi


 My darling love
You are the yellow in the sun. The blue in the Sky. The marshmallow fluff in the clouds. When you think of someone who will always be there, you think of LEVI.

You‚Äôve been through so much. And always maintained such a positive outlook on life. You always said, things would be better. Things aren‚Äôt that bad. Things will always work out.

Until they didn‚Äôt. You couldn‚Äôt take it. You‚Äôve been the strongest for so long. Youve been the glue that holds everything together. And when it was all falling apart for you... who was there? Who was your rock? Who was your ‚ÄúLevi‚Äù?

I hope you know how loved you were. I hope in your heart you understood. How much you changed and shaped this world. You were like no one I had ever met.

Describe Levi:

Levi is tall, skinny, lanky. With dark hair and light eyes. His smile goes for miles. He had the straightest most prettiest teeth you‚Äôve ever seen. He is beautiful beyond description. He loved animals. He loved dogs. He loved women. He loved baseball. He loved family. The idea of family. The idea that one day he‚Äôd have a family. He loved life. No one, could ever be, who he was. He was darling. The most delicate but beautiful strong most confident charming soul. Have you ever met someone who was so confident and full of life and love and confidence? But who also needed someone to call them when there was a thunderstorm? That was him. That was Levi. He was the strongest brightest most optimistic person I‚Äôve ever met. Yet when it stormed... the 12 year old boy came out. He was scared. Alone. And anxious. But I never knew. To what extent. If I could take all of your pain away I would.

Levi,
I know nothing I ever say or feel will be enough to ever bring you back. So I will just speak in your spirit.

Levi,

You are the man we depend on. You are the friend we can call. The favorite uncle. The baby brother. The sweet fianc√©. The sweet country boy who is always happy. The boy who everyone thinks has it all together. Who did you have? Your brothers. And they moved away. You tried so hard to get your life together and you did. But it still wasn‚Äôt enough. You couldn‚Äôt handle the darkness or the pressures of the world.

And here I am. I mourn you. I mourn your spirit. I mourn your energy. I mourn your presence in this world. Do people even understand? The impact you‚Äôve had on this earth??? Do people even know what it is? To experience such a profound loss? No...We go on. We move forward. We keep going. We are but a small blip in this time. In this universe.

All of the pain. The trauma. The heartache. It is all endured. For nothing. You‚Äôre still gone. You‚Äôre still charming and loving and my ‚Äúguardian angel‚Äù. You‚Äôre still the boy I could text and say anything, and you would have the most perfect response.

You‚Äôre lovely. You‚Äôre awesome. You‚Äôre charming. You‚Äôre gorgeous. You‚Äôre the epitome of love and confidence and charm. And now you‚Äôre nothing.

Oh, my Levi. How I wish you would have known how loved you truly are. How much this ugly world needed you. How much I needed you.

They say, Only the good die young.
Now I know what they mean.

It was Saturday morning and we rose early to be on the road by 7am because of the heat.

 We decided not to stay over at lodges or hotels anymore as we did in the past but to rather make planned breakfast runs instead. This entails us taking the bikes to a specific and different restaurant each time and have breakfast there, it would involve a planned route.

The whole point of the exercise is to let off steam after working long hours, enduring stressful weeks in a tough industry.

It was not our first such trip but it was the first trip I document in this way. If the mods find my posts not fitting here, please remove it, no worries.

We stopped at a bridge on our route to [Marken, South Africa](https://i.imgur.com/pL6fCtg.jpg)
30 minutes later I met a [friendly dog](https://i.imgur.com/j2KrSAe.jpg) at a [restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/E8jzugk.jpg) in the middle of nowhere.

So I'm posting this on a  Saturday at 23:13 just for reference okay.

I found out a thing on Sunday the previous weekend which really fucked my mood over. And while SWIM (aka someone who isn't me) decided that taking tramadol instead of self harming was a good idea. SWIM also told me afterwards the following 2 days were literally hell and he couldn't move or anything. He was rudely interrupted midday on the day he took and was forced to move and help someone. He ended up throwing up and making things worse for himself.

So next week. Aka Wednesday I'm getting my own place (kinda.) It's enough for me to actually decorate and stuff so im calling it mine. I also dyed my hair and FYI I either needed to bleach it more get darker pink dye because Arctic fox virgin pink is too light. I'm going to eventually get darker dye and dye it again

I feel okay. Kind of still off kilter but okay. "

Today was mostly bad. Mainly because it turns out I forgot to request days off for next week and it is too late now for me to request them off. I plan on trying to find coverage and if I can't find it just letting my boss know ahead of time that I won't be able to go still. I think that ought to work. I know She will be mad about it so I am just not bringing it up for now unless it ends up becoming an issue. I feel like I could swear that I remember requesting those days off though, it's the weirdest thing and it's making me feel stressed :( I had a rough day at my second job today too which wasn't great. Her and I went to see the new Fantastic Beasts movie though and that was preeeety bad. I wouldn't recommend it. I feel like the plot was over stuffed with a bunch of stuff, the movie didn't feel like it had a cohesive story, and there were an incredibly small amount of fantastic beasts! The film had none of the charm that the first one had. Well, that's all for now, got to work in the morning."

Alright, time for some posts! I have gotten behind on these a bit and I am not sure I am 100% on why. I feel like I remembered earlier in the day yesterday but forgot by the time it was time for me to sleep. Let's see, Tuesday. I remember going to class on Tuesday and I didn't have a quiz in the morning which was a nice surprise but I feel like I understood the first lecture of the day for that class well and I had an exam in the second class of the day. I thought the exam was alright. I know I struggled with bad thoughts a good deal that day and these past few days. I just need to reassess and think things through and follow up with old successful techniques because I feel like the few weeks before were pretty good for me. Got to fix the bad thoughts though. Work went well for that day too even though I had supervision.

&#x200B;

Wednesday was rough. I made some bad choices later in the night but didn't relapse or edge or anything but did have some bad thoughts and stuff. I had some bad thoughts about a few classmates. I just need to calm down. I got my exam results back though and I got a 100% which is awesome and I was excited about. I ended up studying for my Thursday exam really late but I ended up doing well.

&#x200B;

Today I made some weird eye contact/potentially could be seen as flirty or something glances at some random stranger I sat across. Nothing happened of course and I just got up and left when I needed to leave, and I was probably just in my own head about it, but I just need to not be approaching life that way. Idk where Her and I go to move to. I need to get my act together. I had an easy exam today which went well. The drive home took a while. Just trying to relax and not worry about things. Looking at places to live now! That's all for now."

I hadn't updated in a month.

I swear, everytime I think something good is going on... something bad tells me otherwise.

I got a call today from the doctor's office and it turns out I have a mass in my uterus. I had an ultrasound done last week.

I'm not pregnant, otherwise the urine test results and ultrasound would've said so and I'm still a virgin lol.

I don't know how this mass came about. I had a UTI in June and then the pain kept happening. I for sure have prolapse too because there was some weird pop and wetness and... yeah. The tightness and heaviness came because I wasn't sitting correctly after a few months of UTI symptoms. It's gotten better slowly in that regard because of my diligence in light exercising.

I have been consistent (or almost so, at least every morning and almost every night) with doing stretches and core strengthening exercises for the past 2 months and the pain goes away mostly. I can move without being as scared of hurting myself. But there are still times when I still get pain in my pelvic area.

So to hear that it's a mass is scary. I might have to get surgery and I don't have money for that, especially in the United States where it's thousands of dollars. It's better than dying though.

My doctor put in a request and referral for an MRI and a gynecologist so I'll have to call back tomorrow to see if it's approved by my insurance.

I live the most easygoing, boring, and chill life. I work in physical labor. And when I think I'm about to finally start changing my life, my body decides to change too. I'm so sad right now.

I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this. At least my new doctor has been more proactive in getting me help than my old doctor, whose staff acted like I was exaggerating my pain and symptoms."

3 days back I started reading The Godfather by Mario Puzo. The first chapter is called Wedding on Long Island. It's Don Vito's daughters wedding day. He is taking care of his 'business' in a private room. After discussing the matters and making the decisions, he goes outside and dances with his daughter to a show Sicilian music.

After reading this part , I realised what a transition it was - he is of course a Don and a feared man, he'ss taking care of the business , had to make hasty decisions, and these decisions better bring him good news etc.... So it's kind of like a tense, adrenaline, fierce, evil mood. Then soon he coolly leaves to dance with his daughter on her wedding day - this is cheerful, sweet, savoury, merry moment. In this moment I realised that Don Vito had been calm the whole time. He didn't fear or worry when he was making mob decisions few minutes earlier, and now when he's dancing he's not ecstatic, but happily content. So maybe when you know things are...well actually my exact thoughts then were - when things are alright and you know it, and you know how your actions are going to bring the result you want, like nothing could go wrong and everything could be handled in a matter of hours, we feel so much content, calmness, just short of bliss.

I was taking a poop today and I was thinking-  I hate festivals now, hate people wishing it on texts. I used to love it. Used to wait days ahead, make plans about activities, dress, food, pranks, preparations. Now it's just more painful than a normal day - The wishes reminding me of something I don't care at all now that I used to love. And then I realised, I used to hear people saying they hate festivals...and that now I can understand why . Like a great scientist doing experiments on himself, I can now have a bit of idea about the person who says he hated holidays. The Long Island Wedding crossed my mind, like I would have also loved holidays even today. Who doesn't want that perfect festival, enjoying with family, stuffing food, exchanging gifts, mingling with friends, having a fun night outside or sitting inside room sharing anecdotes and happy incidences while noisy kids run around after each other. Right? Maybe some don't want that. Because of the obvious reason that they cannot have that. Because not everything is alright, and nothing can be done .........

Idk if someone gifts this moment or life, I still think there might be some people who would still not take it. This now reminds me of a situation I had thought years back ( and AJ I hate that you ruined it with your own theories) - before birth you are given a choice to be born in the family of Bill Gates and to have a very standard happy life, or to be born to say some poor houdehold and growing up with many challenges, what would you choose? That time I had thought a lot on it ..weeks...asking this question to my friends. Now I do not want to think anymore on it - out of exhaustion and not because my response changes.

PS- remember that balck and white song you heard on TV while lunching... something about dadada... remember it

I hate writing to myself sometimes. Diaries always make me feel so upset and sad with my life. Sometimes I think it does more harm than good to write everything down. I think though, I spend most of the day with these negative thoughts and find bullshit ways to distract myself with fun youtube videos and games instead of coming face to face with my emotions. I hate acknowledging them; they just prove how terribly sad and pathetic I am.


The realization about how much I care and think what others think about me is so depressing. I police my every thought, action, and idea, afraid of how others will react. I hate it. I hate that I feel no good at anything. But, the smarter side of me says, ""Well if you tried anything for more than an hour you'd probably get better"", then I just slink back in my chair and turn on loud music to drown out my thoughts.


Why don't I just try harder? You made it this far with almost no family or friends. What are you afraid of? You wallow in your sadness and about how you can never make friends. Sure that one girl in class said, ""I don't think we'd ever be friends out of this class"", so what, right? What if those other girls didn't want to be your friends and go out for lunch? Fuck them right? \*sigh\* Am I boring? Am I self centered? I greet others, I ask plenty questions. I've took on drinking to try socializing more. I don't like it though. I'm twenty four years old, how is it that I haven't hung out with anyone besides my boyfriend since high school?


Sometimes I think that if I left this world, no one would remember or care for me other than my boyfriend. My family don't call me, my mother won't say ""I love you too"" when I tell her I love her (as if that's really new). I feel like I really don't care.


I carry it all though. I try to tough it out everyday. I see someone sad or having a tough day, I stop and ask how they're doing or crack a lame joke. Surely, there are things worth living for, even without anyone, right?


The air is crisp and cold outside. Stepping outside I smell the smoky aroma of enticing meat being barbecued by neighbors. I can almost hear that crisp little clack, popping the lids of their Budlights and Coors. Dogs are barking into the late night and howling at the train's echoing horn. I almost feel it vibrating in my chest. Little pitter patters of soft feet scurry the yard and glowing gold eyes flash at me before disappearing under the tall brush that lines my fence. Harold approaches me and with a loud and obnoxious screech demands my attention. I love this cat, he is a whiny little bastard, but his beautiful striking orange fur soothes me. Cradling him I feel his paws draping themselves over my shoulder and as expected his claws carefully dig into my back and he begins kneading on me. He nuzzles his cold little snout against my cheek and automatically he turns on that little motor boat purr of his lol.


Surely, a god couldn't have been as cruel enough to put me on this world to simply die at my own hands? Is there one? What kind of lesson am I suppose to learn here? Why give me such a life?


Why am I so afraid to dive in? Failure?
Life is so funny these days. So much technology we can live in comfort with our fears. Afraid of ridicule? That's okay. Nothing like anonymity through the use of light boxes and this crazy invention that can spread information faster than the blink of an eye throughout the whole globe. Crazy.


Fifty years back, I'd probably be using some elaborate mystery mail club or something lol, ah, I remember, they had weird sections in the classifieds sometimes.

I dont even remember the last time I was here. Guys in my life have changed. Brother got married. I have 2 jobs....

One thing at a time I guess. I've gone back to my downward rut. Going back to my therapist in 2 weeks to see if it helps. But I just feel maxed stressed, on the verge of breaking, and exhausted from keeping it all together.

I've been diagnosed with HPV and have had testing and biopsies to see if I have cancer and to prevent the abnormal cells from becoming cancer. Hopefully get good news back on that soon. Because it's super scary.

Even with 2 jobs, I've been sitting all week with less than $2 in my account. I work at a retail store on Saturdays but a 12 hour shift. I'm about to quit because it's just too much. 40 hours at my main job then 12 hours nonstop is exhausting.

I havent lost weight, last I knew, but I keep working at it. Haven't smoked in 3 months! I've wanted to but I haven't!

My brothers wedding was perfect. I love my new sister! They invited me to go to their Thanksgiving, but idk if I want to... I think that doubt just comes from the blah I'm in. My best friend I havent seen in 2 years surprised me there and it was the best thing to happen to me in years.

Normal work is stressful. I keep messing up, and that's just not me to make this many errors. I'm just so spread thin with everything else.

I'm just gonna wine it up tonight. Wish this new guy would come over... anyways, thanks yall"
0,"A memo to myself and anyone that can relate
  **The Aftermath**

I guess you don‚Äôt know how fucked up you truly are until you ruin something that it is so meaningful to you.  I should probably be writing this in my diary, but I really cannot be bothered.  Plus it is easier to type.  I am no writer by any means but I need to express some things.

Maybe there is a problem, a problem with me and maybe it is something which I have never really tried to combat, I am not sure. When something you love, rather think you love (since it‚Äôs the only romantic love that you know), destroys all trust and empathy in you over and over... apathy and dissociation to the self occurs. Sometimes this dissociation results in a dissatisfaction to one‚Äôs self, to one‚Äôs body or just one‚Äôs life. It sucks and you mentally and physically pay the price for something that someone did to you, how they made you feel. Mentally and physically in this sense being self-blaming and self-sabotage which can take the form of many different things. Yes, it was not my fault however, we act in ways to help ourselves sometimes in ways we shouldn‚Äôt - I know that doesn‚Äôt really make that much sense to read but I am sure some people can understand that sentence. Anyway. The reason for all of this squabble is to express the aftermath, the aftermath of how something that detained you from expressing how you truly feel may (in some circumstances) implode onto future relationships.

This ladies & gentlemen is truly the effect of not healing properly. And that is not your fault, not always anyway. Some people are not understanding enough to want to help you with your demons and run, they run. Sometimes you run, you run from the ones that can and are willing, and then you may‚Ä¶ you may even take for granted the one‚Äôs who can and lose them. That‚Äôs the one that hurts the most.


We talk extremely loosely about self-love, self-acceptance, self-everything. Yet do we really know what that is, the one‚Äôs who have been hurt I mean, do they really know when they have self-loved or whether they are finally enough? Is there some kind of scale? I think not. And no, I am not saying people who have been hurt are not enough, but during the aftermath of such hurtful experiences we OFTEN feel this way which acts as a precursor to avoiding relationships in the future or negatively affecting the ones that matter most. Maybe not for everyone but for me it did.

Some time in your life, the one‚Äôs that have felt hurt in some way (which is probably all of us), will have to undergo some sort of mental therapy or even physical therapy or some other ‚Äútherapy‚Äù to help you to not mess everything else up in your life when the problem was never you in the first place.  It was him, her, them, the one‚Äôs who did wrong and who made you hurt. They should pay, not your future.  I know, I know, it is easier said than done. But it must be said before you destroy all the better moments and relationships you will fall into on your journey.

Alright, time for two posts. Yesterday was.... so long ago it feels? I am trying to remember the day. I know I did very little in terms of homework. Her and I watched a whole lot of Dr. Who together which was actually enjoyable. I need to clean up my thoughts right now, they're not getting me anywhere useful. Anyways, I did get a good chunk of my study guide for my exam on Thursday done yesterday which is a positive but I didn't do any of my paper which is bad. I need to remember my work bag tomorrow for school and I feel like I am going to forget. Well, that's all for Sunday. Today was a meh day. I trained officially for the first time at work today which was new to me. I liked my trainee a lot though which was awesome. He was a pretty chill dude it seemed and his listened and worked well. After that I went to my other job which didn't go as well for the vast majority of the time but got surprisingly better toward the end of the session. I got home to see that She was just finishing up making dinner for Her and I, She is so sweet. :) She wants to practice cooking She said. I enjoyed the meal overall, the meat was a bit overcooked, but that is how we learn! I gave up on having something to turn into my professor by midnight and instead found some potential sources and am now studying for a few things I have tomorrow shortly before going to sleep. Alright, that's all for now."

I also googled ""how to tie a noose"" purely out of curiosity and I got a helpline number with the tagline ""are you feeling suicidal"" lol, same thing happened on YouTube too which I found funny. Anyway I found out how to do it and it's suprisingly easy lol. I'm weirdly happy about it.

The manager there never paid me my money. he said he would call me when the checks come in but he never did. ohh when i came in to work on thursday, half the staff didnt show up until only a few came in. we were short staffed but we had it under control.  i only worked 4 hours before getting sent home because it was really slow.i hate those kind of jobs where weather affects the business. if it rains then the car wash gets no business and everyone goes home. at the grocery store job, people flock to the store.  i have a job interview on saturday. i hope i get the job and have a manager willing to work around my grocery store schedule. it would be so better than working at the car wash under shady conditions. i been feeling irritated the last few days. that means something is going to piss me off soon. i know the grocery job is since they want to give me more days to work. im happy with 3 to 4 days. i hate that place. im getting angry thinking about it. i just want a stable two jobs for once.

Or maybe he has a secret agenda and wants to make me his assistant drug dealer. omg too much imagination this morning. im so quick to judge so i have alot of thoughts about the manager there.  on other things the save file on my pokemon emerald game was deleted because the goddamn gameboy decided to shut off while i was saving. that fucked my night and to add to insult, the gba cable i borrowed from my coworker didn‚Äôt work so now im feeling some kind of way. right now im going to start a new game on pokemon diamond. im so upset because i put in 90 hours on that emerald game.  i learned the hard way to pay attention to the battery indicator. god i hope i make it today. i just hate when all the effort you put into something go to waste. im staying away from the gameboy and will be focusing on the ds games. the pain is real. i gotta get up soon and get ready for work. it fucking hurts!!!!!"

If you saw this post despite not being a commoner on reddit, congrats. You're stalking me. And you may finally learn my true self.
Let me start by how i describe myself:
Unpredictable, Enigmatic, Sane.
Like any other people, i have human traits. I'm kind, compasionate, a good listener and pretty much how you would describe a normal person. But yet, every now and then i'd feel different, i don't get fazed by unfortunate events.
Probably becausr just like a normal person, i havr experienced alot of problems. Especially family ones. My future is uncertain, it feels like it will always lead to failure. But i'm a normal person, so i'm positive that it will turn out fine. I love myself, but also hate some parts of it. Despite that, i would never go so far to say that i wish i was dead. Though i say that every night as a joke. I prefer living, even if it hurts. Because im normal after all. I don't like talking, i prefer to listen. I can't also seem to trust people easily. Almosy everyone i have met has already betrayed my trust. I can't seem to bring myself to love properly aswell. I never bern betrayed by love before, infact, i betrayed love. I hate people who has the audacity to ignore. And if you're hated by me, then you're a terrible person, because i rarely hate. I don't get angry aswell, only disappointed. I want to feel love again, but nothing so far has made me feel it. I hate this part of me. So far, thats how i describe myself. There you have it, my true self."

0,"All I ever wanted was a friend
A lot of people have told me that I had thoughts of an older person when I was young, I believed them and I kept those views and they helped me make it day by day. What I knew I was missing was a friend, not a relationship but I so wanted that too. At the moment I‚Äôm 18, so still pretty young, I go to school, I have a job, and in a couple of years if things go well I‚Äôll be a nurse.

Well back on topic, 4 years ago during freshman year is when I lost my grandpa, after that I was aloof with most things, and it was a week before christmas and I never really mention the bad about me cause out there somewhere, someone has it worse than me. So a few months pass by and then there‚Äôs this girl that messages me, we talk and she‚Äôs cool and in my mind I‚Äôm thinking that she can be my friend, the first person I can tell my secrets and emotions and just be friends, but how naive I was, she started having these emotions towards me and I didn‚Äôt feel them back.

Our friendship declined after that because of time spent away and then when school started back up again after a winter break we picked up again by talking and stupid me thinking she shouldn‚Äôt have these feelings but not caring cause she was nice and new and full of energy, she was just my friend.

A couple months in I get a girlfriend (not her) and I don‚Äôt regret any of that experience (another story for another day) and it was my first relationship ever. First kiss, first date, first everything, well shit happens and somehow she continues being my friend. After half a year my ex and I ended it and well I was trying to calm myself down, keeping my secrets to myself until I was calm, until I could speak about it, taking care of my own problems because they were mine.

This friend of mine stayed by my side for the longest time with feelings still being amongst her. A couple months later I got another girlfriend, one of her former friends and shit happened. Typical bullshit teenage drama I won‚Äôt get into but I didn‚Äôt care I was with this beautiful amazing girl but eventually like everything else in my life, I screw up.

After tip toeing around trying not to get anyone hurt and fights and more bullshit teenage drama, me and my girlfriend were in a good place finally until this party my friends had. I was so excited, I was an idiot.

This party was at the beach at a friend‚Äôs condo where they drank and got fucking wasted. We had this sleeping arrangement and it was all ruined when there‚Äôs people drunk passed out. So this friend was there and she was scared or whatever, there was literally no place to sleep but the ground or this couch thing, so it was her on the left, me in the middle, and another sober friend to my right, I put my back towards her and I dozed off.

In the middle of the night where I was asleep, I felt like I was having this dream, like one of those ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù dreams, turns out I wasn‚Äôt dreaming, her hand was down right in my shit and I was trying to get to hers, it felt like half a minute before I finally came to and I pushed her off and ran into the bathroom crying and hating myself. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I did, how I fucking cheated.

After coming back I told her I‚Äôm sorry, I fucked up by sleeping next to her. I was crying silently, I went to the floor where my backpack was there and I went in and fetched out my little pocket knife and I tried slashing my hands and my legs disgusted and ashamed of what I did. I hate myself for it. I wanted to kill myself, I wanted to be punished.

The next day I left, I left my friends behind, a shirt, a friendship, and my dignity, I cried and when I broke the news to my girlfriend she punched me and cried and she left. She was dressed up so nice when I saw her because she knew I was sad and I had to break the news to her in person. I felt horrible. I dropped my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that same day through what seemed the worst way which was through text, and calling her a mistake. My mistake.

After 6 months which is now, I still se her very often because same college program and I got back with my girlfriend and although it‚Äôs not the same, our relationship has grown exponentially. Often I think about if I‚Äôm doing the right thing by being with her, I feel like she‚Äôll be better off without me but then again I really don‚Äôt want to lose her. I‚Äôm 18 and young and whatever but I feel like I don‚Äôt have much left, just a feeling.

That friend that I was talking about, now just a shadow that walks and talks to the rest of my friends, which is why I no longer have many. I no longer want any, I just want to be better, I just want to be the best version of myself again, I just want to disappear cause I know I‚Äôll end up disappointing again.

I know the only real friend I have are you guys, just strangers with similar or worse problems than I do, if you took the time to finish all of this then I applaud you, thank you for allowing me to have this place to say what I gotta say, nothing beats friendship then admitting my deepest regrets and mistakes to strangers.

Today was a pretty decent day. It kind of flew by. I had some anxiety and bad thoughts and stuff while at work, but I feel like it didn't get too out of hand. Work was pretty fun today. I woke up in a super good mood for some reason and I am not sure why. I have the next two days off and am really excited about it. All I did tonight was play a toooon of video games. I just played like.... probably at least 7 hours of Overwatch. Oh man, it was a good time though. I'd like to play more tomorrow but I do have some homework and studying to do. Priorities and all that jazz. I was trying to get lootboxes to get cool new skins and got 0 new legendary! The one legendary I got was coins... Unlucky event for me so far. Maybe that luck will change though, we will have to wait and see. Alright, I reallly need to shower. That's all for now."

so far the car wash gig been okay. only problem is the long 10 hour days and me being on my toes all of the time. i have to be quick. on the 3rd day i made a mistake of sending one of the car through the wash with the window down and not cleaning one of the floor mats. one of the manager yelled at me twice for it. the head manager kept telling him to call him about my work schedule at my job.  i call him and no answer. a day later he called back and i told him one of the days i can work. im free one day and offered to work a few hours on the other. he said no to that saying thats not how he does things and then he said he would give me a call if he needs me. that hurts, i really wants to keep that job but he makes it seem like he can replace me at anytime. he said he has 15 applications sitting at his desk.  he can fire me at any given moment. its one of those jobs where so many people come and go. i don‚Äôt want to be one of those people. i want to have a solid spot there. everyday i worry about getting that call saying im no longer needed.  i have my main job at the grocery store so it won‚Äôt me too much. my feelings and pride would be hurt. i have to get up early for work, i hate it. on other things i hacked my nintendo 2ds but im playing my nintendo dsi to preserve it. its very special like a gem.  i still don‚Äôt have a bf or a close male friend. its so hard to find ."

One leader of the house is positioned to lead a department. Weeks ago, selected employees went on training on a certain subject which benefited both the employees and the clients. Without her instructions I made my own initiative to collect and monitor the attendance, which she by the way gave me the instructions just before the training ends. I complied.

It was not my responsibility to record the training on the back end which I did since I have to file them to 201 anyway. Today, there was a back and forth or calls and emails regarding the number of employees that‚Äôs supposed to be given the certificates and her dispense on me blaming me for not doing my job properly which was supposed to be hers.

Today was a pretty good day overall. I had some bad thoughts and stuff but nothing too bad. Her and I actually did something after work today which is really exciting! We talked yesterday about how we need to try and become friends again pretty much. Life's hard, but so it goes I suppose. We ended up watching a scary movie together! It wasn't scary though I suppose, more like a suspense movie. It's called Hush. I remember us learning about it years ago and thinking it looked interesting. It was pretty good overall I though. Had me saying wtf at the main character a few times, but that's that I guess. I need to do some homework tomorrow after work, maybe She would want to do something fun tomorrow too.

So... I decided to buy some artic fox virgin pink hair dye and some manic panic bleach to change my hair style up again. I had pink hair at the beginning of the year but ruined it and went to braids which is cool and fun but I've had them in too long. They're grown out like crazy and starting to dread again.

I ordered it knowing it was a long weekend so hopefully I can get all my braids out and stuff this weekend and save my hair then the dye and bleach will come next week hopefully.

I offered to pay half of the bill but she declined and insisted. Im blessed to have her. She was feeling down today tbh. I didn't know what to say cause I can't really answer her questions as I don't even know the answer myself. The best thing I could I do is listen and give her some positive thoughts at best.

Depressing story of the day. My three week fling with G has finally come to an end. I was right that it was never gonna work out. He said he wanted to be friends instead but I know that it will never happen. My initial intention was to be friends. As time goes by, that starts changing and it conflicted me to thinking if I like him or not. I actually wanna be friends cause he is for one a very interesting person. He just don't wanna hurt my feelings as much as possible. The best thing I can do to forget him is delete his number and block him on social media. He already unmatched me on tinder so no need for me to do that. Starting now, as I read this, I should start focusing on myself more again. No more silly things that can break my heart again and go back to what I was before. Positive thoughts. If I'm gonna read this in the future. I hope you are having a great time."

Wow, day 700! absolutely crazy to get this far. It has been a long time. This day was great from what I remember! We slept in a bit more than we planned, but still got up and left at a good time. I slept for most of the car ride because I was quite tired, not sure why. We met up with everyone and had some delicious Mexican food for lunch. After that we went shopping for snacks and finally checked into the hotel.  Ok, what did we do after that. I think we ended up going bowling first, which I thought was pretty alright at the time even though I am usually not a big fan of bowling, afterwards we went to an arcade and played some games there for a bit. And still after that we had time to go and have fun at the water park for at least an hour. Oh, and we ended up getting some crazy guy kicked out which felt good. After the waterpark we all got dressed  and got some local pizza for dinner that I loved (She thought it was only ok). That's all the big highlights for this day.

Sunday was also great. We got up pretty early, had some very 'meh' panera bread for breakfast, and then started this quest thing for the kids. It was actually pretty cool I though. They got a toy wand and had to go and follow some clues and point the wand at certain things to get treasures and other stuff. So we did that for a little while and eventually decided to go for a car ride so that the kids could nap. The kids fell asleep and we also drove to some sand dunes near us which were pretty. For dinner we went to a local burger place that was probably my favorite food on the trip (that or the pizza). She liked it too which was good. We came back... I am not sure. We might have tried to play a card game? or maybe that was the night before, I think the night before. Anyways, I passed out this night I was so tired.

Today started well. I ate left overs for breakfast but nobody else ate. We finished up the magic quest, spent the rest of our credits on food, and spent the rest of our arcade points on a few different games. The kid ended up with a decent amount of tickets and was able to pick out a pretty cool pair of sunglasses from the prize box thing. During all that we packed all of our things and checked out, before our parties went separate ways we all got lunch at a different local burger place that I wasn't impressed with at all. She drove home because I don't want to drive Her new car. When we got back we couldn't find Her card which She was pretty sure She handed back to me after She got gas but I couldn't remember. She was really mad with me about it. We eventually found it in Her car and She still seemed mad and I told Her that She should just carry the card Herself from now on if She is going to get so mad at me if I potentially lose. I don't want to do something that feels fairly thankless (although She does say thanks and stuff) if She is going to get so mad at me for losing a card. She can just keep track of it Herself then, imo. I am trying to do Her a favor by carrying it for Her. Anyways, I am trying to not get anymore heated about it. Now we're both mad as She didn't like when I told Her that She should just carry it from now on. Ugh. I need to study a bit and then sleep. That's all for now."

We make the most of our lives as we can.

To fall in love with someone is to be the most vulnerable. To open yourself up to them. To kiss tenderly and peer into their eyes and know that this is what you want for the rest of your life.

That, is powerful.

To go so long feeling alone and feeling unwanted, brushed aside, to then suddenly have this person. This incredible person. It makes everything worth it. Every long hard day and every wet pillow leads up to this.

And then they leave you. For good.

And there's nothing left but countless more wet pillows, and the loneliness creeping back in.

We are born alone.

N. One of my good friends. Smart, strong minded and has a fierce attitude. She tends to believe on what she wants to believe and i admire her for that. Thanks for being with me since high school :)

A. Also bestfriend, former Mutual Attraction too. Our story is weird. We used to like each other back then but im glad it didnt work out. I mean she became one of my closest friends after all.

I guess he wasn't that interested. Thankful for him for listening to me everyday. If only we can be friends but its going to be hard.

So... I normally don't have anxiety. But due to my health and the shitty healthcare system, I became extremely stressed yesterday. My chest was super tight, I had a hard time breathing fully for hours because I was so stressed.

I was stressed because I read more about prolapse and when women reach menopause, estrogen stops being produced and estrogen helps keep the pelvic floor nice and strong. Also what if I want kids but I get prolapse again? But worse? It'll end up in surgery and I'm not made of money, especially in America.

I reached out to my older brother who lives in another country and I hardly vent to him unless he calls me first. I broke down when I wanted to update him on my frustrations and he couldn't handle hearing me like that so he had to hang up. He reached out to his best friend who called me right after my bro hung up. My anxiety was through the roof. He said that his wife might be able to get me an appointment which was reassuring. But thinking back on it, it's okay if I don't get the appointment... I suppose. Just because I'm not in a lot of pain right now. I was super super anxious though and I just wanted reassurance and advice. My health has improved compared to before I didn't do any workouts. It's crazy. The progress was very slow, I only expected to just keep doing this... like forever.

My bro told me to add his other best friend and his best friend's wife and I reached out to them too. The wife has been through a lot as well, longer than I have, though it wasn't prolapse but she understands what it's like to have incompetent doctors. She was encouraging and I appreciate that. I really wish the human body wasn't so complicated, it would make all our lives easier.

Anyway... I'm going to try to keep at it and do the core/pelvic floor exercises. The wife told me it's possible I won't fully recover for a whole 6 months, but that is reassuring that I could be at 100% next year. I was thinking I might have to deal with it for the rest of my life..."

Anywho I found out at 6pm I had to jump in a car for like 3 to 5 hours to pick up my nephew and niece for a few days. That sucked also it was a long car ride and long car rides aren't a really good for me. Seeing my niece and nephew wasn't too bad. It was good tbh. Just the whole driving. Didn't pick them up till 10:30pm

We stopped in to a place at 3am and slept there for a few hours. That was good but my niece is bad. She was vertical when she fell asleep then managed to do a whole 90 degrees till she was horizontal.

Uuuuhh I'm mostly sleepy and calm right now. I got like 3 hours of sleep maybe 5. I also need to take my happy pills.

And this is today's post.

Back to talk about my health again. Not a fun post.

So a few days ago, on the 1st of October, I was supposed to see my doctor. I was going to change doctors sooner but I needed a referral to a gynecologist. Unfortunately my doctor never put in that referral like he said he would. I waited all of September for that and he never delivered. Also, they kept changing schedules and on the day of, they changed again. Apparently they called me but my phone has no record of them calling me. And they don't leave voicemails. And guess who had called off work that day to make it to the appointment? Fun. The doc was gone before I got there and was gone before my appointed time. I had an argument with the desk person. I told them my frustration of having to keep waiting and continuously getting rescheduled. They told me I was exaggerating my symptoms (pelvic pain from prolapse issues now that I identified what was bothering me, which resembles uti issues). So I changed doctors by phone and what phone people said was different from what the desk people said. I called the new doctor to verify and for sure, the desk people were wrong... and the desk people said that I didn't understand. I honestly think they don't understand. They were very rude and insensitive. I don't like to argue with people unless absolutely necessary. They've even joked once about me waiting for the restroom (uti issue) but it was a long time because one of the staff was in there. Who laughs about inconveniencing people with an infection? No one with a uti should hold in their bladder because it can make it worse, and they laughed. So unprofessional all around. It was a very very shit day. I have cried because of them in the past and on that day. I hope they're shut down for how terribly run they are. (the doc didn't even know I had an allergic reaction another time when I asked, he said it was a side effect.. turns out it was shock smh)

Later I went to urgent care because the Planned Parenthood doc told me I had some bacteria in my urine and wanted to prescribe an antibiotic. I was concerned it would get worse. They allowed me in and checked my urine, it actually seemed ok which reassured me. They also prescribed cipro... but that antibiotic has a blackbox warning on it and has a rep for causing tendonitis and ruptures in the achilles heel and muscle tendons. I took the prescription slip that was handed to me because I didn't want to be rude... but I didn't go get the prescription filled. It's been a few days and I don't have signs of a uti so maybe I flushed it out...? I hope I'm not speaking too soon, I have a tendency to do that...

After that I unloaded on my old friend Jon about my day and he made me feel a bit better. I felt bad about telling him such a heavy thing but he really appreciates honesty and he said it put things into perspective for him. That he thought he had it bad... but I told him that suffering isn't a contest and any concern he had was valid. After that he told me some fun stuff in return about his trip to Mexico City. He and his boyfriend Huan have this relationship where they banter and bicker but in good fun. Jon also told me stuff about his family issues and concerns about his work, like a business lowballing him or him getting possibly sued for selling his own work, which was putting a lot of stress on him. I work in retail so I don't have half his issues but I wish I had the expertise to help him too. Also we ate and watched a drama on netflix together until I had to go home and surprisingly my uber was 38 cents! I was shook. The driver was nice.

For my health I'm hoping to get a pessary in the future for my prolapse (and have it diagnosed as medically necessary so my insurance knows). I do want to fly out and visit my sis in the winter but with the change in air pressure I'm worried my prolapse would worsen when the airplane descends during landing. In the past week I've managed to make my prolapse reverse to the point where I'm not worried about it falling out should I do some labor at my work, but when I move the wrong way it does hurt. It's not as tight in my pelvic area, like when I press down from the top, but I'm not at my 100%. I feel pains when I need to eat, I can't skip a meal. I've been diligent so far in doing pelvic exercises at home to ease the pain and to keep the pain away... working my core muscles does make me feel good too as I'm not doing hardcore activity and wakes me up.

But yeah... other than that I want to go to Disneyland with my youngest sis. I won't ride the rollercoasters for now so it rules out some fun but I want to see the decorations amd buy cute Halloween stuff. I've always wanted to visit during October and since I've had health scares I feel like it would be nice to not think about the stresses of life for a bit. Idk how long of a life I'll have to best to make the most of it."

I havent done this in over a month. And I feel a lot has gone down hill.

I told the guy I was seeing that I was falling for him. I got friendzoned, which I knew would happen. He told me from the beginning he wasnt looking for a serious relationship. But despite all that, I still feel something for him. Im trying to move on but he's making it rather difficult.

I have gone to therapy in about a month either. I can't afford it. I feel I need to go but after my brothers wedding.

I was $1000 behind on bills. And my brother paid for everything to be caught up. I feel bad he had to but it has helped tremendously.

I'm going to the gym on a regular basis, so there's some good news. Haven't lost weight but it's all still new.

I was diagnosed with HPV. I'm still waiting for the results to see if its cancerous. But before talking to the doctor, it's a scary diagnosis because it can mean so many things, even though most of the time it means nothing. I haven't told my family because I'm not sure if it's worth it. I feel that's part of the reason I was friendzoned, even though he has repeatedly told me it isn't.

Starting to feel lonely and depressed at home more often and it sucks. I was doing so good for a while, probably because I fell so hard for him and he made me feel so much better. But I haven't seen him in over 2 weeks.

Once the wedding is over, I'll try to go back to therapy. See if anything improves. At least come spring I'll be mostly debt free but that's so far."

I mean today was okay got some sushi which was heavenly and got some art and sketching supplies. I need to work on my sketching it'll give my something to strive towards and help me with my tattoo designs. The only thing I didn't get was coloring pencils but I did get some watercolor paints so yay??? If this goes anyway I'd love to get a few copic markers.

I figured out why my bro called me. It seems like he wanted to get ahold of our parents.

Wow, one of the exams I had today had a question on it that was some straight BS. It was actually something that we never talked in lecture, wasn't in the book, and wasn't in the powerpoints that we went over in class. That one question is worth 5% of our whole class grade. WTF! I am quite annoyed about it and so was my friend after. The other exam I had though was suuuuper easy and short. I have another exam tomorrow with that same professor for a different class and I am just not that worried even though I haven't studied for it yet. I just got done finally making my presentation. It isn't all that great, but it is done! I think I can get at least a B, and that is what we are shooting for here (I guess).  Ugh. I want to take a nice relaxing weekend off but I have so many thing to do.

Woah, did I not do one of these last night? I feel like I did. Weird. Yesterday was the worst day in a while with bad thoughts, idk if it's something like a stress copying mechanism or what. Either way it isn't helping and it isn't healthy. Yesterday had a lot of anxiety because I had to study and get a presentation started. All I did yesterday was study and didn't get anything done for my presentation. I also didn't do a small amount of work stuff that I needed to attend to which I'll do now.

Just had a breakup a month ago. Was fun while it lasted but couldn't handle the fact that our age difference is affecting our relationship to the point where I dont see him as the same person when we started dating. It felt like an emotional baggage whenever we would meet. Long story short, i broke up with him cause I didnt wanna hurt him even further and it made me felt like that im an asshole because I broke up with him for a stupid reason. Im a douchebag as i told myself all the time but Im happy with the decision i made. I think its better to tell the truth than to prolong something where you think its not gonna work.

Talking to a new person again. Been interesting so far. Taking it reallh slow this time just to be sure. I'm scared of falling in love again. I saw his tumblr account containing some information about him and tbh it kinda made me even more paranoid. The more i think about it the more it felt like its not going to work. The same situation as last time. We havent even had our first date yet. He's usually the only person i talk to at the end of the day which comforts with me ease. Im probably overthinking this time but idk what to do next now. I wish i never saw his tumblr account. I started having to think that im not good enough again.

i started highschool a good 23 days ago (the 5th) and Oh Boy its actually not that bad :)

grades wise, i'm not doing amazing, but thats because we've barely had assignments, let alone quizzes or projects. i have a good grasp in all my classes, i'm only really struggling in honors spanish (i totally understand the language, but speaking it is harder than writing it). I've made the dumb mistake of cutting class! amazing ! im so good at this thing :) but don't worry, i didn't get caught or in trouble and i cut classes that i knew i would be able to risk (i took algebra last year, so cutting two classes didnt impact anything). still is sorta bad that i've cut 5 periods worth of class y i ke

socially im doing okay. i have plenty of friends, all of whom i actually like, ignoring a few flaws they have. theres this one really, reeeeally cute guy who i like and he likes me back :) ive mentioned him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9g1yh1/i_need_help_with_a_boy/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9jslcn/uwu/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=teenagers)

Hi it's been a while. A month since I posted.

In the past month I went to BTS's concerts at the Staples Center with some friends. Bought tons of merch. It was fun.

In regards to my health, I have reason to believe I have Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse. I've been treating it like an injury because it has the potential to get worse should I exert myself or even sit incorrectly... Stage 2 is when my internal organs (unsure which one) is barely behind my vagina, not peeking out. But I'm close and that's what scares me. Stage 3 could mean surgery.

The pelvic floor is a set of muscles that acts like a boat to hold up my internal organs. The ""boat"" was weakened and thus my internal organs descended and created pressure. Since women have a hole, the vagina, it gets pretty bad in stage 3 and 4 territory.

It explains why I had uti symptoms for months, constant trips to the bathroom, pain when I pressed on my abdomen... it was so stressful and painful, but not to the point I needed a hospital. But I feel pain in the vagina now, like something is trying to come out. I looked and... I saw a lump that wasn't there before. I wanted to cry honestly.

Yes it's pretty TMI but honestly people should be aware of this in general because it happens to many women and men also have pelvic floor muscles. Everyone has that ""boat."" Men have that hole in the anus.

Anyway it took a lot of tears, time, reaching out, and researching to find out. A kind user told me I may have been dealing with pelvic hypertension, which led me to looking and concluding with my symptoms.

I've been following along on youtube to do pelvic floor exercises and it's been helping me a bit and reassuring me that I can reverse it. I'm honestly looking into shelling out $425 or something for Pelvic floor therapy sessions, but I need a proper diagnosis first.

My doctor has been... terribly disappointing. No help at all, he just prescribes while I did all the work looking around for help.

Anyway other than that life would be good. I love fangirling and talking to friends online. Wish I can go back to just worrying about social issues lol"

We didn't study anything all that new or exciting in either class. I think I had a rough day with bad thoughts and stuff that day, pretty sure. The evening was fine though. I studied a bit for my exam that I had today, had dinner with my grandma, and talked to Her for a bit. That's about all.

Today was pretty good. I woke up in a really good mood feeling positive about Her and I for some reason (like, overall positive, it felt nice!) I gave myself anxiety throughout the day in terms of worrying about specific people in my classes because I was friendly and talked with people today. I just have to watch myself and know that nothing will happen because I won't put myself into any potentially bad situations, not that I think that is likely to happen now or anything. Deeeep calming breaths. I came home though and went to an Escape Room with Her and two of Her brothers which was a lot of fun and we also played a card game after that I enjoyed a lot.

When I started high school, I was just my sisters little brother. Lived in her shadow, for a little bit until I found what I was good at. Reading girls feelings. I haven‚Äôt hit puberty yet so I was about 5‚Äô3 maybe 120lbs. Wore very big clothing and thought I was a ‚Äúgangster‚Äù. That same year I started boxing and my confidence grew exponentially! With my ‚Äúability‚Äù I made a lot of friends that were girls. Also with being my sisters little brother met a lot of guys that turned out to be life long friends. First year of high school was mostly making friends and refining my ability to read feeling. Got pretty good at it. Summer of that year I went to the beach and partied a lot losing my virginity and starting to have many girlfriends in different places. Sophomore year came around and I was hot! Hit puberty now 5‚Äô10 boxing put some weight on 160lbs and I was a killer. Every girl in high school would die for me, and I knew this and used it to my advantage. Got a ‚Äúserious‚Äù girlfriend at the beginning of the school year, call her Y, but every week I would cheat on her with any girl that I felt had any sort of attraction towards me. But I was still not the biggest player in school. I wasn‚Äôt even really known yet. School ended, finally ended it with the ‚Äúserious‚Äù girlfriend and did the same thing this summer. Partied, sex and beach. Lots of it, but now it was with older girls. Junior year came along and I was even hotter than before! I got an under the table job and had money to spend on clothes. Body didn‚Äôt change much because I had to remain in the same weight for boxing but regardless I was on fire! This year was my year! I made my name known to everyone in school. Everyone knew who I was. Everyone know I was the party guy, the fighter, the class clown, and most importantly the player. At the beginning of the year my sister dropped out and no longer was I her little brother. I made my own name! So much sex. So many parties and fights. This was the year all the freshmen‚Äôs had to go through me to be ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù. Seniors would envy me or admire me. I was king of the world. But some bad news, I failed 1 class and I had to take it next year to be able to graduate on time. Summer came along. Once again sex, parties, beaches and new to the rotation bowling alley. The bowling alley started to be a new hang out spot. We didn‚Äôt have to pay for anything because one of the guys worked there. It was a blast! Senior year came along and I was starting to self reflect on everything. Started being scared to fight, to catch an STD or fail high school. But I pushed all that to the back of my head. Continued doing what I did best. Messing with people‚Äôs feelings. Had a couple girlfriends but everyone was getting tired of me playing them. They caught on to my actions. Teachers would try to keep me away from girls. Still had the freshmen‚Äôs so I was ok with it, but the new freshmen guys weren‚Äôt. A lot of fighting, had to let them know who they were messing with. Around Christmas, 2 of my closes friends got into really serious relationships and I was doing the playing by my self. It was no longer fun to play girl, party or go the bowling alley by my self. So I focused on my classes and by this point I had already failed 3 more classes, I had a lot of catching up to do. Sometime between January and March I met the love of my life ‚ÄúJ‚Äù (no names). Absolute goddess in my eyes. But! She knew my history and didn‚Äôt give me the time of day. Needless to say I always end up with who I want. We started dating in May and we had a perfect relationship. School ended, didn‚Äôt catch up on classes so I dropped out, parties were once again fun with all my friends and her friends getting along. Same with the beach. Friend got fired from the bowling alley so no more of that. That summer I got an actual job and got J whatever she wanted with my 300$ a week. In August I give her a promise ring and promised never to fail her, which I didn‚Äôt...for about a year. Worked all the way to December till she sat me down and convinced me to finish school. Which I did. But from December till June, when I graduated, we were rocky. I never had a phone till I started school that year. Social media is a hell of a drug. I wanted to keep away from it because I knew what I would do if i had it. But once we got rocky I signed up for all the social media‚Äôs. Went on a flirting streak with anyone and i was back at it. Cheating after cheating after cheating. Even tho i was on top of the world with J, the feeling of having multiple women made my current top no longer the highest. We ended up breaking up, big surprise. From then on I worked a lot, focused most of my energy into boxing with the occasional side girlfriend. Did that for about 2 years and then joined the military. Met the perfect girl. Even more perfect than J. We had everything under control and i didn‚Äôt see how anything could go wrong, let‚Äôs call her B. Left all social media, for reasons stated above. Loved her unconditionally for 3 years! Not ever patting an eye towards other women. Then... my sister give my number to an old fling. She texted me, let‚Äôs call her D. We texted here and there. I wasn‚Äôt putting no effort into it. Didn‚Äôt really care for her. I was just being cordial. Then me and B started having issues, distance, i worked horrible hours and couldn‚Äôt talk to her for days sometimes, I would close off and not tell her how I truly felt. But D was always there and always flirting which filled my ego. On thanksgiving I broke up with the most perfect girl in the world for a chance to get D...
Never got D and never got my B back. Now 3 years later, I‚Äôm still wonderful at reading people‚Äôs feelings, always the life of the party, love the beach and if I get bored enough I‚Äôll have a side chick.
You remember how I said I pushed reflecting on my actions to the back of my head. Well! Years later it hit me like a meteor. I‚Äôm a little older now mid 20s. Reflecting on everything I‚Äôve done. I like to tell my self I don‚Äôt regret anything but that‚Äôs a lie to a certain extend. I regret breaking Y‚Äôs heart, she‚Äôs happily married and with kids. I regret breaking J‚Äôs heart and I also feel like I broke her more than anyone. She‚Äôs currently taking care of a no body boyfriend and has a kid by him. Living pay check to pay check (Forgot to mention she was a straight A student before we broke up). But my biggest regret will always be breaking up with B. She was the one. She was the one that I was gonna spend the rest of my life with. She was made for me.
I see all the people I used to hang out with or the girls that I used to play. Most have happy and full filling lives. While I‚Äôm forgotten and no longer on top of the world. This ‚Äúability‚Äù to read emotions was a blessing and a curse. Maybe I could‚Äôve used it in a more positive way but I didn‚Äôt and I kinda regret it.
The reason I say ‚Äúkinda regret it‚Äù is because if I didn‚Äôt do any of those things I wouldn‚Äôt be the man I am today. I care for others emotions now, I use my fighting abilities to teach others to defend them selfs and I‚Äôm always the life of the party.

For ever now I haven‚Äôt had a good voice, it cracks, it‚Äôs off tune, it‚Äôs shaken, it‚Äôs non melodic, I hate hearing the way I sound, I hate hearing my voice when I speak in general. But. I really wished I had that melody in soul, that tune that allowed someone to enjoy what I sang. I wish I could just sit there and sing to those I care about, I wish I could sing and evoke some emotion rather than disgust or cringe. I wish I was capable of having that harmonious sound when I open my mouth to emit my emotions, my feelings, my thoughts through a nice decent song at least, I wish I could sing so that the only thing that I have for when I lose my sight, or have arthritis, or just in bad luck to sing something and enjoy that little moment. To be able to sing is something I wish I had, I wish those who can will continue even if it‚Äôs in their car, on a bus, or at work just doing the routine, I‚Äôm jealous of those people, I really am.

Pretty good day! I had some issues in the morning but feeling better now. I worked, studied, took an exam, and studied more. That's pretty much my whole day! I didn't do anything fun that I remember.

It kind of represents my yearn for the freedom for childhood again and my own children. I want to add little stars and such to kind of represents one of those mobiles that you hang over a baby's crib.

Morning - starting at internship, very interesting. Not used to this freedom.

Evening - meeting with the party commission. The start of the meeting went shaky, people came late, and no big steps were made. Later the meeting took a positive turn and everybody chipped in. I felt the energy in myself, and hoped other would pick on it. Was a real good meeting. Good ideas. Huge.

EMBITTERED OR JUST NOT INTERESTED
-
Girls, my biggest weakness. Always fall in love too fast. But lately I've been having the opposite, not interested at all. I'm not sure why the sudden change. Perhaps it's because of previous attempts and my brain finally realising it isn't worth the energy.

Both my housemates fell in love with the same girl. And another dude in the friends group as well. Usually I would be part of this group. But I am happy I'm not. Feels like I've got a better grip on my emotions.

Saturday - making music with Jisse our new song is come as you are of nirvana and afraid of heights of Billy talent.

Had some beers in the evening with Jop and Irwin they wanted to go out and I refused because I was tired and honestly just wanted to play fallout 2, which I finished so now I don't really have much to do.

Sunday - had some beers in the evening with Ilse.

She is a girl I just don't understand, well she is easy to understand on the surface, bit shy but happy. But what does she really think? Well maybe it could be that I am a retard and don't know how to read such things. But I know I feel this way for a reason, I've evidence build up.

CASE A: THE AMERICAN MESSAGE
Back when I was on the continent America we messaged eachother a lot, even a bit more spicy things. To clarify with spicy I actually mean quite bland spicyness, but for me spicy nonetheless. Things like sharing a bed because she is scared. Or how she missed me and how we shared pictures of our vacation.

CASE B: GETTING MARRIED
OK, easy one to crack this one. She mentioned how we should get married when both of us don't have anybody when we get 30 years old. Yeah, I know this is kinda like in how I've met your mother but hopefully this gets a better finale.

CASE C: SAY WHAT YOU MEAN, DONT JUST COME KNOCKING
At our latest party she was also there. I invited her to come and eat with us. When we went to the store she stayed with the others. At the party she spend most of her time with the others. I stayed in my room with my friends while the others were partying in the living room. While I was in my room she entered multiple times, just to say: ""wow, the party is so fun it is so crazy, you should see it.""
Ok, thanks for the info I am enjoying myself over here. Or did you mean you wanted that I come and join you?

CASE D: THE CASE OF BEER
Every evening we spent drinking she has a tendency to spent most of her times with the others but suddenly visit me, telling me how greats it is with the others and leaves. In the club when she gets disturbed she comes to me.

When I went for beers with her I leaned against her with my head while we watched TV. Eventually I took her hand and put it over me (I like being the small spoon). I said: ""this is much more comfortable"". While she nervously replied: ""uhh, ok""

CONCLUSION: no
She doesn't say what she want, that is clear. But maybe I should say what I want. But my biggest fear is that I like her, not exactly because I like her but because I want to be liked. Getting a girlfriend so you can have that title.

I like what she is, fun, driven. I dislike her unwillingness to tell what she really wants, her uncertainty.

I've written about her quite often, but now I feel like I've reached a point, continue or cancel her. Be more or be nothing. And for my own sanity I've chosen to be nothing. Case closed."

I've been dreaming of my ex boyfriend quite often lately. I hate it because I can't avoid thinking about him the next day. I know why I ended things but I worry that the older I get, the smaller my pool of eligible suitors. The older we get the more baggage we tend to have. I'm not sure I'm gathering more baggage, but I also don't know how much baggage I want to deal with in dating someone in the future. I have very supportive friends who don't want me to ""settle"" but sometimes I wonder how much you can expect from a potential partner. Life is hard. I'm throwing my pity party tonight.

So regarding the strategy I proposed in my last post.  I am currently deep in the main flaw in that strategy.  I have been struck by melancholy, and I am in the early part of a day with nothing to do.  Well no committments anyway.  The lawn should be mowed.  Weeds sprayed.  Leaking roof investigated.  But there's no immediate consequences to not doing those things.

So I'm going to get some McDonald's now.  And go and play the strategy video game I'm currently addicted to.  And just hope for my life to change.

I just feel sorry for my dog, that's she's stuck with a loser such as me.

Depression boredom and lack of sleep are a bad mix. Well maybe not a lack of sleep but tiredness. The real deal breaker for me was having tattoo needles and ink.

So like over the last week I did a few stick n poke tattoos (what some call machineless tattooing) but today I tried to do something on a spot I love the most and I am kinda freaking out. It was a bad idea and with tattoos you can't really erase them that easily.

My reasoning and thinking behind it was ""self harm and tattoos are vaguely similar in that they both cause pain and leave permanent marks or scars."" So if I tattoo myself at least it'll look pretty.

Honestly not the worst idea but I'm slowly worried and freaking out. I might hate it and that's my worst fear.

0,"A post to move on from one day
Never thought I would see myself writing this, but I was told it would be therapeutic to do so - so here goes nothing.

Its nearly a month from my 31st birthday and this year, I am back to being alone. The worst part of it all - I am the reason for where I am now. There are so many songs about turning back time, and yet, all I am able to do is re-live it all in my head as it happened. People always say they would like to fly or see through walls if they were granted a super power. Not this guy. Just let me turn back time once. Just once.

It all started in mid-2016. A girl was hired that was just a few rows over. But not just any girl. She was the real deal. Smart, charismatic, beautiful, and fun. So much so, I was fixated by the grander of it all. I found myself wanting to spend every second I could with her. We became close friends pretty quickly to the point where she began to open up to me about the problems she is going through - including her boyfriend at the time. Already early on, I knew I had developed feelings for her, but I did not want to get in the way of her relationship. So there I was, listening to it and hoping that I learn from everything that was bad so that maybe one day, if dreams do come true, I could be the boyfriend she needed.

Eventually, the two of them broke up and sooner or later, all those wishes directed at every star I could count worked. We became a couple. The next year that followed was the best year in my life. Before her, I never put myself out there to be in a serious relationship. And it wasn't that I didn't have the opportunity. I was also the type that never wanted to sleep with someone unless I truly loved them. This meant a lot to me, and I wanted to save myself the pain of being with a women only to eventually have them gone from your life.

Now here is the problem. All of your Hollywood movies make it seem like being a virgin is the worst thing ever. That no girl would want to be with a virgin. That they find the thought of it strange and that the man may have something wrong with them. In my case, I turned opportunities down because I was not ready. But who would believe that? So I lied. When asked what my past was like, I said I was with women before. She said the same and we moved on. However, this was the first time I ever lied to her. A lie that looking back on made absolutely no sense and could have helped out the relationship.

Another early issue was that I was advised to refrain from making relationships public at work. I've seen people get fired for it even though they weren't on the same team. The thought of having her get fired with the reasoning of her spending too much time with me would destroy me. I was concerned it could be used against her and I held my foot down as much as she wanted otherwise. I so wish I could do this over and open it up publicly and show everyone how lucky I am. And if people were negative, than maybe the workplace wasn't the right fit for either of us. But it should not have been an issue the way I made it be.

We continued to have a great relationship. We traveled, stayed local, shared so many common interests that everything was enjoyable. And then on one trip, another hiccup happened. A major blow. A few weeks before, my family sat me down and asked that I help my brother with dating apps. He was reluctant to download them, so I did on my phone to show the family how simple it is for him to find someone to date. I showed them a comparison of apps and swiped left and right carelessly to show how they function. I never had the intent to use them for myself. Not when I had the best girl right in front of me. One that no girl can compare to. So on one app, I never messaged anyone ever. But then, my idiot self did something only a true moron would. While in pretty bad stomach pains sitting on the toilet, I had a notification of a chat. So I sent a message back as a distraction. I had my girlfriend there at the time with me in the room nearby, but I am a pretty closed off person and don't like having people worry. So I chatted for a minute with this person I have 0 care for and that was that. Well, turns out, another notification kicked in and the girlfriend noticed. She confronted me on the matter, as anyone should be, and the truth was so farfetched, that she did not believe me. Fair to say, I would not believe me. I begged and begged her to trust me, to ask my parents about me downloading the apps and showing them what they are all about. She was hurt and devastated. But somehow, she found a way to still love me. To try and believe me. Even though in the back of her mind, she felt it was all a lie. She tried for me.

Fast forward to what would become the start of the greatest mistake in my life. A few weeks before thanksgiving, she would bring up how excited she was to share it with me and my family and that she has no means to celebrate with her family that year. Great! a girlfriend who truly wants to spend time with your family is what I have always wanted in my life. It meant the world to me. The problem? I had a demon that I never encountered before in my life. I found true love, love I wanted to extend to living with them for the rest of my life. But this love of mine came from a different faith. My faith is one where the entire religion rides on it being passed from the woman. A man can be of another faith, but the bloodline of the religion is passed down by the woman. Now, I am not a believer in religion at all and I consider myself agnostic. But I grew up with the notion that I have to be with a woman of the same faith. If that were not the case, my parents would never speak to me again. My entire family would cease to exist and I would have nothing. At least that is how i played it out not realizing that I would have something. I would have everything I ever wanted still there with me. My girlfriend.

Well, I panicked. I never loved someone and then I found love in a woman outside my faith. I started to pull away. And in doing so, I didn't invite her to thanksgiving. I was a wreck. I knew how much this would hurt her. And so I left my dinner early and made her a thanksgiving dinner just for the two of us that same night. But she knew something was not right. That what i just did was not normal. And I never told her the reason for that action at the time.

Ever since that incident, things became rocky. She wanted me to do more, to be what a boyfriend was supposed to be. And I just kept backing away further and further while trying to fight to hold on to her and balance out this demon that I hoped would eventually resolve itself. I was hoping that somehow I would find the courage to bring this up to the family. Share how much she meant to me and that no matter what decision they came to, I would side with her.

That never happened. Instead, I was confronted about it and I sided with the family. Biggest mistake in my life. This is the one, the one moment I would give anything to turn back and correct. This changed everything. We cried as I tried to say she will be ok. That she will move on and find another me. A better me that she deserves. And I caved in to the demon in my head.

Around this time, a new girl at work that lived nearby became friendly with me at a time where I needed a friend. I needed someone to talk to about all things not related to my girlfriend and the demon in me. I never had intentions to be with this girl or do anything romantically. It was therapy in a way where I didn't have many friends to help me out with. One night, she calls and says she doesn't have access to the house she was dogsitting at, and asked if she could come over. Not thinking anything of it or feeling the need to bring this up to the girlfriend (who at this time, we were mostly off in an on again off again relationship), i said sure. The night ended early as the following day was a Monday. Nothing happened and it was clear that nothing was going to happen between both of us.

Well, lesson learned. The girlfriend found out and doubted everything I said. She assumed we had something going on and she said enough is enough. Now, in these two years together, she had slept with friends (not romantically ... I think), at their place - with one being in another state entirely and not telling me about it until i found out. She reacted by saying I would never understand that they were just friends and that is why she wasn't honest with me at the time. Yet, when i brought up the same here, she felt it was a lie to her face. If only she knew how wrong she was. How I would never do such a thing after telling her in between this time, that I lied in the past about the women I was with. And that she indeed was the first.

All the above strikes cast such a cloud of doubt over her regarding me and my actions, that she had enough. We broke up for what seemed like for good. Yet things again took a turn for the worst. All of my actions took a heavy toll on her and she found herself seeking medical help. She was depressed. And I had no idea to the extent. And then one night, she called and told me she considered taking her life. Throwing it all away because we were no longer a couple. I was terrified. I wanted to be with her so so bad, and yet I could not kill the demon I had. So I didn't know what to do. I drove as fast as I could to her place to reassure her she would be ok and she will find someone. This seemed to help her. Although it crushed me like no other. I wanted to be there for her for the rest of her life. To never see her in that situation ever again. Yet even at this moment, I could not break out of my fear.

After this incident, there was one more. A call where she expressed if we are no longer going to be a couple, she will stop trying and move on for good. She went to the extent of saying she will sleep with someone right away if i said it was done. And if there was ever a time to say stay with me please, this would have been it. I failed. Like the many times before. I failed. Well, she did what she said she would do. She went out, and slept with a guy within the first week of the official breakup. Now this was not just some random guy. This was a man at our same workplace who she worked with. He was a Director who was twice her age. This man was going through a divorce and had a reputation of sleeping around with many women and using them. And in this case, he was doing the same to her. And seeing this, I was crushed. As I write this, I AM crushed. This is not past tense right now, but happening before my eyes. What was once my girlfriend whom I thought was reluctant to put herself out there, who saw being romantic with someone came with loving them, was just a lie. I found out she truly pushed herself on this guy (who knew the opportunity was there for the taking), and the deed happened. I can't accept that the girlfriend I was with for two years and love with every ounce in my body, threw herself at a guy twice her age and only a few years younger than her own father. And knowing as much as I do about the guy, I despise him for using her the way he is. Sure she might see it as her using him as well. But I would like to think that her state of mind is not healthy and she is being used. But the thought of that also bothers me. I thought she was stronger. I thought she saw things my way when it came to being intimate. I was wrong.

I don't know how to move on now. I lost my lover and my best friend due to my actions and she has found a way to move on and be intimate in a way I would never have imagined. I would not have been ok with any guy for that matter since I still loved her. But I would hide it and be supportive to the best of my abilities. But in the situation she is in, I am devastated. My young, beautiful, smart ex lover that I still love is hooking up with what could be her dad. I am not strong enough mentally to cope with this idea. All i do is visualize everything we did intimately, but he is doing it to her. And I was already super self conscious when it came to being intimate. The thought of an older man twice her age and twice her size making love to her, and doing it better than me, and having her love it, I am dead inside. I wish there was a way I can move on. But I am too emotional. I can not put myself out there the way she did. I need love, and my love is gone.

I hope one day, I can look back on this thread and find myself in a better place. A place where I will still recall the fondest memories in my life, but where I can at least be in a place of happiness. Right now, I just can't even get myself up in the mornings. Breaking up is one thing. Saying you want to break up when you really don't is another. Seeing the person you broke up with after not wanting to break up with them sleep with someone else so quickly and twice their age, I just don't have answers right now.

Worst of all, with the official break-up, i finally found strength to confront my family about the feelings I had for her. I told them I would be willing to no longer see them for the rest of my life if they were not comfortable with the thought of me and her (if time could be turned). And after talking it out, they agreed love trumps their own beliefs on faith and that they would just want me happy even if they are not comfortable with the differing religions. So after everything was said and done, and she slept with someone so quickly, I got the ok to love her forever. Great timing life. Thanks!

I wish she doesn't get hurt. I wish her all the best. I wish she was still the girl I knew and the girl that just held back a little longer to where I can be where I am at now. Accepting and fear-free. I won't ever have that chance again. But maybe if I try wishing on stars again, the way this all started, maybe time will go back for me. If only...

To now and future self - Be strong. Find a way to accept what happened. And make yourself smile. You owe yourself at a minimum a smile.

I'm posting early but this my energy is gone and I need rest even if I resent and hate myself for it.


I don't even know. I'm more stable vertically not sad not extremely happy but I'm off kilter, side ways.  Anyway something makes me want to self harm today. Maybe I miss the feeling. Maybe it's something, nothing or it's probably a sign of... Idk, a symptom. I just don't know the cause.

Also today is the first time I took out my tools and looked at them.  I use to do that a while ago and just wait for the moment. It was like I was waiting for something to tell me do it.

Sleepiness is getting to me now but I can't decide if I want to start self harming again and go futher down the road or be known as I currently am. A sad depressed good for nothing lazy individual.


Oh final note I can't remember if I mentioned it but I asked master chi (obvious fake name lol) if he was scared I'd end up in hospital. He's mentioned it before a few times when I've disappeared for a weekend but I never knew if it was serious.

Apparently he was... He's scared I'll end up somewhere far less happier. "

So it seems I'm in a lot better headspace then I was yesterday. I'm more calmer and at ease and have decided the place I once called home, I'll never set foot in again. If it comes to it I'll sleep in the park and be homeless for a few nights. That place is no longer welcoming to me. I should have realized the moment I stepped into it last weekend but...

I know it doesn't make any sense but I'm leaving a lot out.  As for my urges they are still there but a lot less powerful now. I still have an urge to destroy my arm and end up in hospital but it's manageable now. However if I do I'm blaming him just for the lols and a huge fuck you ;)

Also I spent most of today trying to catch up on rest as I think I slipped my antidepressants yesterday and didn't sleep for a day or 2. That probably helped a lot. "

Why the long break?
I've been trying to write all my logs in my book. But a lack of motivation slows me. I still only have written a few pages. I need to make a concise choice. Stick with the book or go digital.

Second reason. I've become embittered. A lack of success and stress made me like this. Unable to love the same way I did before, because others don't share the same feelings with me.

INTERNSHIP
-
At the begin of the month things weren't looking up. My friends and colleagues all got work and I was sleeping on the couch at school. Until I started to call companies from a exstudents list. I had a good call. Spoke about 11 minutes with the man, he would try to create a project for me. Later a teacher came up to me with an internship at a company that designs a home use beerstill. It's a startup company. I was invited for a meeting at both. And both were a success. I just didn't know which one of the company's to choose. Different wages and different work. I've got to be honest my choice was based on how much I make, 300 euros or 500 euros is a big difference. And making a little beer brewery is more fun, and working more directly with a team is more interesting.

Yeah, one of our famed parties. Always a absolute mess, and everybody is wasted. I invited my close friends with whom I mostly spent time with. They left home early. Wesley invited a few friends of his own. They joined us in my living room while in the kitchen and living room and hall people were ""partying"". Of course you might wonder why I but that in quotations, it's because if that is called partying I find it fucking moronic. Throwing food and screaming in a cramped space is not my cup of tea. I love a good party but people too wasted and with too little respect for the house piss me off. What is this the first time you drank alcohol? Why can't they control themselves? The entire home was a mess, and the smell was worse. I spoke with a few people who weren't absolutely wasted, they didn't really seem to enjoy it themself. When you wear a good looking dress you don't want to put it close to filth.

So yeah, I decided to spent my time in my room with 3 others. I don't want a mess in my room and the others were on a different vibe. We ended up going out. It was crowded. Almost got in a fight in the first club. Later we went to a club, and people were walking around with balloons and sucking on them. Ah gas. I wanted to try and so I did. Bought the XL balloon and took some good hits. Damn that feeling, so short but definitely hard. It's like Thomas said, like the moment gets repeated a 1000x. Wesley also did it but he went harder than I did and fell on a guy. After that we left, didn't really feel welcome, weird types.

The rest of the night was still crowded but we went on danced had some beers and smokes. It was fun but nothing special. At the end of the night I linked up with the group of the party, but most of them were so tired, I was almost the only one who danced. I left with Ilse and others. I am glad she is my friend, but spending time with her and getting more physical is making me question our relation, do I want more than this? We have been talking a lot lately also about very personal things. Despite that I know we have some conflicting interesses. She loves Dutch music and volk culture and I hate it. She is a goody two shoes and I make mistakes. Meh, I'll see."

Heeeyyyy, getting close to 700. Alright, today was real bad. I didn't study enough and had a real hard time with bad thoughts. I have a lot of tests next week and feel like I am having a bit of a hard time getting motivation to do work the past few days and that really stinks. I need to knock it out of the park in terms of productivity in the next few days so that I am ready for all of my big tests that I will be taking next week. That's all for now I guess. I am going to study a bit more and then catch some z's."

I'm here and my tools are on the desk next to me. But my energy has dropped to basically nothing. All I want to do is lay here and curl up in a ball, forgetting about everything.


I ended up making a lot of my posts on FB hidden and blocking all my family members (there were only 3 left. Brother, sister in law and sister.) I may regret it in the near future but for right now I needed to do it.

I'm finally stable again. A lot more stable then I was this morning. I'm still scared I'll wake up and hurt myself, end up taking the painkillers or both. I'm scared they'll talk to me about what happened during the call they didn't want me to know about. I'm scared they'll confront me and it'll make things much worse then they were today. But right now I'm just tired of everything. I'm tired of the world and all it's people.

I'm going to try sleep it away but I'm happy I'm stable. My baseline mood has dropped to about 3 or 4 out of 10 but I'm stable and that's the main thing. "

I don‚Äôt know how I feel about him anymore. It feels like the initial attraction is mildly wearing off but not enough for me to lose interest at all. That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I‚Äôm more lost than ever after the last time I saw him. Everything went well. I had an amazing time, he said he did too even after the fact in a text later after we went our separate ways. But something feels off... I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it either which is really what‚Äôs bothering me. He always seems so down to make plans with me but never overnight or at either of our places and never on the weekends even though I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs got the time off work. And even when I offer a solid plan to accommodate us both better he finds a reason not to do that and gives a half assed explanation for said reason. Even if he‚Äôs being honest, I just wish I‚Äôd get a better explanation because I‚Äôm so fucking confused.

I‚Äôm afraid if I try to have a more serious discussion about our visits it‚Äôs going to come off like I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äúput a label on us‚Äù or ‚Äúget serious‚Äù which, yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt mind. But I‚Äôm not trying to do that and I‚Äôm not sure how to convey it so it doesn‚Äôt come off that way.

He turns me into something I don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm not with him. At least the few days immediately following a visit. The lead up to see him again is fine too. It‚Äôs so weird. I always get my hopes up but I don‚Äôt really tell him what I want and then I get upset (not with him) when things don‚Äôt play out ‚Äúright‚Äù and I realize that‚Äôs my biggest issue but I feel like it‚Äôs just way too soon to lay it all out like that. The last time I tried to do something of the sort it all went sour and he misunderstood and went the complete opposite direction of what I meant. I feel like these are all discussions that should be had in person but I never know how to broach the subject. God, it feels like I‚Äôm getting such mixed signals and I have no idea how to interpret them. All I‚Äôm getting out of this is that I don‚Äôt fucking understand the dating world.

I know mom said to focus on ‚Äújust being friends first‚Äù and I‚Äôm genuinely trying to be okay with this weird nsa fwb dynamic we‚Äôve got going on but I‚Äôm not sure that I am and it‚Äôs kind of killing me not knowing if he wants or would ever want more from me. I know J wasn‚Äôt the one for me and I know I wasn‚Äôt happy with him and it only would‚Äôve gotten worse over time but I kind of regret ending things with him. I liked the familiarity and the comfort of him. Maybe I am just a chronic over thinker and all my problems are in my head.

Honestly I partially wish it wouldn‚Äôt work out, sooner rather than later, because T is still in the picture and I do like him. And I know for a fact that he likes me and would treat me really really well but he‚Äôs so far away and I know he won‚Äôt come here any time soon. If I could at least see him to see how the in person chemistry goes I may be able to make up my mind a little easier but instead I‚Äôm stuck with two mostly seemingly perfect individuals each with their relatively major flaw and I just cannot pick who‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.

I wish life had a hint button I could press that would point me in the right direction or just flat out tell me the answer to one of my biggest questions, I‚Äôd even take a question limit like one hint/answer every 3 years or something. Fuck.

Sometimes it feels like he really does like me, other times I get this weird gut feeling that all he wants is sex, and other times yet I feel like he likes having me around as a friend who‚Äôs available for sex but it isn‚Äôt necessary. I‚Äôm not even sure what I want from this situation anymore. The more I think about it the more confused I get. But he does make me feel better about my body, which is a huge blessing quite frankly. God that man got under my skin so so so easily. I hate it. I hate that this is what my life revolves around now. "

We all have that little voice inside us, the one that whispers to you late at night mocking your darkest and deepest insecurities.

Well I've spent the past 12 days battling an ever increasing urge to watch my arm bleed then burn it to hell. I'm kind of happy and sad to say that I'm ""clean"" whatever the fuck that means. Sometimes it's a good thing other times I wonder if it means I'm just too weak to cut.

Anywho this morning I read something that wasn't meant for me but was about me. You know the kind of things that little voice tells you about. Tells you how others think of you and such well... It sucks to have those confirmed.

I read in someones own writing that the lowest I think of myself is what they think of me. HOW FUN! RIGHT!!!  The things they said... It hurt. Hearing it from someone who is family but who thinks you're a waste of space. It's exactly what I wabted.

This has pushed me to my limits. I want so badly to disappear into nothing.  Run away into the safety of the burning flame and let the sharp Razer kiss my skin once again. I have about 1 hour maybe 2 left before I can finally reach my tools. I'm going to hope that I end up disappearing into the dark comfort of sleep and skip food till next week I guess.

I'll update once I get there and let nobody know if I self harm or not.

the last couple of days been rough emotionally. dealing with attitudes at work and being talked to harshly bothers me greatly.  i know i shouldn‚Äôt let it bother me but it does. today my aunt had a serious talk with me about taking sleep pills saying they can be very addictive and that she doesn‚Äôt want to ever find me dead. i know she means well but it hurts and i ended up staying in my room til nightfall.  part of me feel ok and happy because of the antidepressants but as im writing my feelings are shattered. im scared to face her now because she can be like a broken record and wont let shit go. she is also the reason for my depression. she can be so controlling to where i feel like im in prison rather than home. sometimes i contemplate suicide but i just push through by staying in my fantasy world.  thats all i can do to take my mind off of things.

Me: male in my 40s.  Tradesman. Living in a major Australian city.

I'm trying this journal as a strategy for coping with my depression.  Yesterday and today have been relatively good days.  Last week was really bad

A thought I had today, is that when I have good moods I'm just going to stick to my normal work and free-time routine.  Enjoy the little things, but not try and go chasing huge highs

And when I get low moods, I'm going to try and just put my head down, and plod though my normal routine.  Try not to dwell on my thoughts.  Just keep busy

In my current mind state that seems doable.  When I'm in the grip of a low mood I suspect that will change

So a little about myself.  I like playing strategy video games, like Distant Worlds and Civilization.   I like tv shows like Ozark, GoT, Suits, Westworld.   Im not in a committed relationship at the moment.  But there are a few ladies that I catch up with on a semi regular basis.

I will try and update regularly.  Thanks for reading

I didn't have many friends.  If you think you could be a friend, especially IRL, I'd really like you to contact me.  Thanks.

I‚Äôm reading this thing on how to start to handle your anger. Part of the solution is finding the root of your anger.
How fucking stupid is that?
What if every single thing that has ever fucking happened to you is what makes you so fucking angry? Then what are you supposed to do?
What if you have seven therapists tell you over a span of 8 years that you are completely healthy with no anger issues, just to come home to a bunch of broken appliances nonworking remotes. A shattered cell phone. A fractured wrist from missing my punching bag. A cracked computer monitor.
But also just this fucking fire that never stops in my chest and my stomach. I just want to hit things. I just wanna hit someone. I just want to make someone feel the way that they all made me feel.
I promise I am better than that though. These are just the things that I can‚Äôt control feeling and I really wish I could.
I‚Äôm ashamed of how angry I am.
I used to be so broken and so sad.
Now I just feel hate.
And I just feel him.
I just feel the other him.
And the other him.
I just want to scream at the top of my lungs and never stop.
You all thought you created this broken person that would end up taking her life never really thinking that they would survive this long and grow to fucking hate you and hate everything about themselves too.
But now I‚Äôm not even broken anymore. I don‚Äôt even know how to feel that anymore. I just hate. I am just mad. The stupidest shit makes me lose my goddamn mind anymore.
I feel crazy. Every day people always make me feel crazy. My friends and family do. They think just because I have this anger inside me that I‚Äôm a monster. But I‚Äôm really not a monster I just can‚Äôt control it anymore. I just want to break things I just want to break myself I wanna break my bones
How am I am I in love with someone who is such an opposite of me? He has optimism. He has peace inside of him. He knows joy. I am slowly ruining this person. I tried to warn him when we first got together that he really didn‚Äôt want to get tangled with someone like me.
Why couldn‚Äôt he have listened? You‚Äôre just too good. "

I have been putting that off but it would be so useful if i could get one. I tried playing some Overwatch a bit today and that started off well but got worse as a played more.

It's not like I don't want to talk to you. I just don't know what to say to you. I kinda got tired of talking the same conversation as before. I tried to be a did listener but it's hard. So much resentment inside of me that I'm unable to let myself breath. How did this happen? Was it my fault or what?

I'm trying to get better at our relationship but it's sort of exhausting. After living here for less than 3 years, I'm emotionally drained. I'm going out more to avoid your daily tantrum of work. I tried to listen but it's frustrating when you talk in circles when the solution is right in front of you.

I've helped you out in the past and all I've gotten was disrespect in return. Why am I trying so hard to mend this but it's just getting pushed back?

**I. Don't. Know.**

I just hate this constant feeling of anxiety when I'm around you and it's because I don't feel safe here. I tried to cope with the situation but it's hard. It's fucking tiring!!

I'm just tired of this shit. Why can't things just start over? If I could press rewind, so I can edit a specific spot in time, I would in a heartbeat.

Yesterday when I awoke - there was a strange stillness in the air. An eerie senses of calm was over me. Me? Calm? Never. I should have known something was up. The day felt hued in grays. Looked at my phone while still in bed. A google card about vultures profile on Mac Miller. I read through it. Absorbing. Empathizing. I was hopeful. Things were ok.


I moved slow. Thought out every movement. I felt very aware. Very present. Very still. I ignored my phone. I didn‚Äôt want to speak to anyone. Or get caught up in the fast pace of messages, phone calls, the internet. It was too much. Too fast. And I was feeling, slow.


I made a smoothie. Had my vitamins. Cleaned the house. Walked the dogs. All so quiet. Calm. Even the dogs felt it. I know.


Went to put on some music. Had been listening to swimming non stop, but for some reason, it wasn‚Äôt right. The moment was off. I turned on a slow Beatles playlist. Slow. Soft. Dreamy. Romantic. I sat down. Breathed. Felt my presence in this world. Felt very aware of my existence. It was very unusual.


When I saw the notification, I just felt, pain. Slow, silent, grief. Unbelievable. It couldn‚Äôt be true. Someone who held a vital part of my existence in his hands. Gone.


The rest of my day was on autopilot.


I remember at one point in the evening. Going into my room to pray. When was the last time I prayed? It‚Äôs been years. I prayed with no dialogue. No words. Only feelings. Pain. I prayed for his mother. For his family. For the future that would not include him. For his soul, his smile, his light. I wept. Because I felt, he had so much more to give. So much more to live.


As I lay in bed last night, I reflected on the events of the day. Had my spirit known? Was my spirit silently mourning him without me even knowing yet? Was the universe around me shifting because it knew. When it was happening. Everything is connected. Everyone. My world knew, something was wrong. Something was different. Something was happening. My spirit was already in mourning. Everything was different. And the world knew.

These are posts for Wednesday and Thursday! Wednesday was my first day back to school. I wasn't too nervous about it and it went well overall. I really like that I have all of my classes in one building, makes it really easy not to get lost. I had some anxiety and worried/bad thoughts about Her and I that day and Thursday. Just being around people my age and far from home didn't help I guess. I feel alright now though, I think. Classes went well though. The first one seems more physics based than I expected and the other one that day is all about research methods which I am not really that worried about. I went and stayed with my grandma that night which was nice and got to see my aunt and my nephew that I really haven't seen enough of. The next day was the long day. Had classes for like 6ish hours. I didn't end up eating the second sandwich that I packed for the day just because I didn't feel like eating it, even though I ate only a little throughout the day. I found someone else in one of my classes that went to the same school as me, same major, and same minor. What are the odds? The world is weird. I was a bit agitated when I got home with Her for a dumb reason but She told me that She was having a bad day and that helped tbh. I work tonight and don't want to bleh. Alright, that's all for now.

""She puts the weights in my little heart.""

Morning - Little work at school, preparing meeting for tonight. Made some calls and e-mails.

Midday - Volunteering work in the kitchen, quite fun. Had to lead the kitchen which was fun but exhausting.

Evening - Commision meeting. Was a bit chaotic but good fun. Afterwards we went to my room and had more beers. at 00:00 we celebrated the birthday of Irene.

Yeah, dumbshit reporting. Ready for misery. Falling in love again at the first touch. Falling on my face on the first disappointment.  This time touch and physical affection is my poison.

I saw how she massaged my housemate, I'll admit the jealousy became too much. I saw how she looked at him. How can I blame them? I needed time for myself. I went in my room and looked at old pictures of my mom. I talked to my mom in the pictures. Same moment she came in. She sat next to me and gave me a long hug. But all I could feel was disappointment.

Midday - visited my mentor at school. Conclusion, i'm pretty boned with my internship, I have to find something now or settle with what I have. Spending the rest of my midday chilling and arranging an event for 27 september. I did spent some good time with Irene.

Evening -  cooking for Jisse's family. Made mole con pollo with advice from my aunt. It was a good succes! Afterwards spent some time talking with jisse, always good stuff.

Yeah I felt down. No upside down frown. Laid down on the couch no motivation at all. And then she came. I saw her before and asked if she wanted to join me, she said she wanted to work in a more secluded area, but there she was. She sat next to me and touched my hair while I told my troubles. Of course like previously Mark came in, in a bad moment. Despite that we continued sort of cuddling which I enjoyed. It lasted long. She read my diary, noting multiple times that she found it very personal. I said it was no biggy. She even read 19 december - 25 december. The time when I had a thing for Maud, she noted how she found it quite sad in a laughing manner. She went to most of all pages, and she put her fingers on the pages and felt the drawings. Each page she read she put her fingers on it, and while laying with my head on her side, I followed her movements with my eyes as her fingers slides around.

Like i've written before, I am not sure if she is just really friendly or actually likes me? Despite that, all in all. I don't know her really much, so before I do anything I want to get to know her better. Perhaps invite her to do something with me. At least so far i've always enjoyed her company, and I love getting mushy, but before she becomes ""girlfriend material"" I want to get to know her better. But I must not forget to focus on myself, I want to stick to my school plan and not get delayed. If she truly likes me well find a way.

Overal, pretty good day. Not very effective but I re-found my motivation, for girls and for my internship. Have some good leads i'm going to follow tomorrow. Overal 8/10."

i never post much in my diary due to laziness.my laziness and procrastination will be my downfall in life. i just know it. without getting to deep, ill try to skim it. my depression was put in remission thanks to my antidepressants i started taking last month. it helped me feel fine until yesterday when a coworker was talking shit about me saying that i was bland and boring. that hurted and it hurts more since he is the same asshole that gives me a hard time. i hate working with him. that made me slip back into my depression. waking up was rough because i woke up at 7 am to feed the dog and then i went back to sleep. when i woke up my brother was in the shower so i did a quick wash downstairs. he got done with the shower and grilled me about Turning the water on while he was in the shower. it made me more upset because he been a real douchebag lately and im taking it personal. he makes me feel like im the bad guy sometimes and i hate when he talks to me like im a 2 year old. i went to work later on and did my 4 hour shift. work was ok which is what im going to leave it at. when i got off i stopped by a store and bought another cellphone to use with safelink. i know i didnt need it but it was on clearance for $20 and just wanted it. i got some pizza and saw 2 hot guys in suits that was making me drool. i want to write more but im too lazy and take things for granted."

Alright, time for another post! Today was short. I slept like trash last night and am not sure why. I don't think that I will sleep very well tonight because I will be nervous about school. Tomorrow is the first day! I think that I've done everything that I need to do to prepare (but idk what I am doing so who really knows). I am worried about my classes being too hard, the area being a little bit dangerous, the long commute, and being away from Her. Whew. It's a lot on my plate. Speaking of. Her and I made dinner tonight and it turned out pretty decent I think! I made lemon garlic chicken and She made a cauliflower mash thing. I worked today, one hour more than I thought I would which is exciting because I need all the money I can get. Her and I are trying to do some budgeting stuff and it's difficult. Alright, that's all for now. I will get through this and will be done with school and onto a career before I know it, right? "

Hey all! Today was a good day! As usual i went to college and then i came back. I learnt today how mridangam was made. I was glad to know about it since it has never seemed complicated. And... i ate with all my friends at college which is a good thing. I practiced Rubik's cube today with proper concentration. I definitely understood what was a ""proper look ahead"". Happy to have understood it. Book reading has been a thing this year. But it has been so laggy with lots of gaps. So i already feel i am developing good habits, not that i had bad habits, but i refer the unnecessary habits like texting and scrolling insta feed and stuff. And i posted another 2 parts of the video i received yesterday on my YouTube channel. I think that is all for today. Bye!"

When am I meant to have a single spare moment? To grade or to do laundry? When? I haven't graded a single thing since school started. It's just piling into a huge stack.

This morning my husband dropped my baby off at daycare. He told me the teacher said that his nails are too long. Poor little guy. He wants to play with the other babies and be social but they can't let him because he might scratch them.

I started crying when my husband told me this.

I am losing my grip on things.

Time for a post! Today was Her and I's anniversary! We didn't really do anything special for it :p Whew I feel tired. We did cook a dinner together though which is pretty cool I would say. I don't really know what I did all day. I had some worried thoughts and stuff earlier in the day but feel pretty ok now I would say. I might try and do some real quick exercise thingys right now before I go to bed. I don't think it's advisable to exercise right before bed, but I'm not too worried about it to be honest. Man, it's hot in here. Alright, that's all for now. School starts toooooo soon."

0,"3 September 2018 - ""Internships and the Dentist""
""Yeah rub it in my face, what you have I apparently don't deserve, thought I did my best, my reward is to wait ""

.

Morning - visiting workplace for internship, greenlight but not exactly what I wanted. Visiting dentist, went to the wrong one at first, called and said i'd be there in 15 min, kind people.

Midday - going to school to do little. Slept, and did communicate with some company's and teachers. But nothing substantial.

Evening - eating with the group. A new member joined, Esmee, not sure what to make of her. Ilse and her were talking about their internships and gloating about it. At that moment I knew I wanted to leave. After dinner I left went home and played Fallout 1. If I am going to be depressed I am going to do it alone.

INTERNSHIT
-
It was supposed to start today. The time when a student works in a company and gains knowledge and even earns some money. I have tried my best finding a company, but to no avail. Feels like I've cursed myself by gloating how much experience I have, about how I've worked so hard to get where I am. It doesn't matter. You have to call at the right time, know the right people. It is not like I haven't tried. I've called so much and been rejected each time. Yeah rejection shouldn't be a big deal but after 10 attempts it gets depressing. ""No sorry we don't take interns anymore"" or ""sorry we already have someone"". It makes you think: what am I doing wrong? Why doesn't fate smile on me? Do I deserve this?

This morning I remembered a workplace I've visited before and how the guy who worked there said he was looking for a intern. I called him and he said I could come over. It went well, said there were options, I just need a project that I can work on. Oh, and by the way I don't do internship compensation, is what he said. Don't get me wrong I've worked for no money before. But it depends on the situation. Volunteering, sure! But doing the same job as my classmates, who get 300 euros each month. I can already imagine the conversation. ""Oh I make 300 euros a month and I work on the most coolest project and have the best teams to work with. How much do you make?"" It just the first day and I've already experienced this. Why do people keep talking about school/work after it? Fuck off man, it want to relax.

I've called teachers and will email them. Perhaps tomorrow new cards land in the deck.

MONEY IN MY MOUTH
-
It's been a long time since i've visited the dentist. The last time was in Mexico when my nephew helped me for free. In order to fix my teeth which was broken i've made a appointment with the dentist. During my checkup I was notified that I am not insured for my teeth, and that in order to fix all my teeth it would cost 1000 euros. As a student I was not happy to hear this.

At least the people who worked there were very kind to me, but damn man I just want to fix my teeth. So currently there are four options to choose.

1. I pay the 1000 euro for my teeth and I'll be without problems.
2. I wait until January and get a new insurance which covers my fucking teeth, I'll still lose about 400 euros
3. I get a ticket to Mexico and let my nephew help me, and also see my family whom I do really miss. Might cost me 800 euros (ticket and tip for nephew)
4. Do nothing at all. Saves me 1000 euros, but the consequences could be horrible for my teeth.

I made jokes with the dentists about selling my kidneys for money, and how I might just see them at my funeral. Buying a gun and blowing my brains out is the most economical options now, I'd also be rid of my damn internship problems.

Funny how my nephew told me to fix my teeth as soon as possible, and how now it might take until winter to fix fit. Funny.... funny.

Overal shit day. Hopefully tomorrow will be less of a wank. I give this day a 2/10 reasons to buy a 9mm on the black market."

I did not write yesterday, although i will compile and post. Yesterday was good (i will be saying good often since i boost too much self positive thoughts) since i drove again at night along with my brother! I parked the car on my own properly in a small space which i am proud of. And i went to the studio and kind of did some work related to Guinness. At evening i attended my best friends sister marriage reception which was a good juncture and chance to meet some of my school friends. Nevertheless a quite acted as if they have never even seen me in their life. But i loved the love which i got from my old friends who were so proud of my achievement and i am so grateful to them. I met ""everyone"" and the talk was so good! That is all for yesterday!

Today as usual i went to college and on the way back i had to go to the car dealer and finish off some work which my father gave. Then myself and my brother went to a hotel nearby and ate dosa and bonda like nomads. We were surprisingly very hungry, so we ate and left stomach swelling out of our shirts (gigs). After i came home, i was so so happy to see the leo fortune(bakery) cover which amma bought for us so that we would be happy for the evening snack! (big fan of bakery items). Then i went to the studio to collect the finished footage and came home and right now it says the video is uploaded. So i will go and check that! Bye!"

How about a vegan hotdog cart? I am so enthralled with this idea. How much money could I make?? If the location were right I feel like I could make a fortune. What a fun job it would be, too.

No health insurance, though.

Well, it's worth looking into.

Been having a lot of dreams about foreign travel.

...im currently typing one handed on my phone while feeding my baby/letting him nap on me.

I hope when my husband wakes up he takes a shift and lets me get some work done.

Grace Cathedral Hill. That's why I'm thinking of hotdog carts. Been singing that song to my baby.

Went to Janmashtami yesterday. Didn't get dressed up. Just went to pray. Baby cried because the Kirtan was blaring too loudly through the speakers.

But he calmed the and enjoyed seeing Krishna.

Fuck r/Aspergers. Just got a flashback to this time last year, think I'm a little traumatized.

Typing one handed...with just my thumb...scatters my thoughts.

Had one dream...where I couldn't find my baby. Then I thought I'd left him in the car ---my biggest fear.

I was consumed by my OCD but I'm getting better.

Alright, time for a few posts! Haven't updated in a few days and really need to get back on track of doing these daily! Lets see, what happened Friday? I know that I didn't work, but what did I do all day? This might have been when I cleaned the house up a bit? I don't think so though. I think I started playing some Overwatch again that day (which is pretty much how I've spent my whole weekend). I had some anxiety a know but feel pretty good today. Yesterday was pretty fun.  I worked another close shift with a manger that I like but that I never get to see which was pretty cool. I also got my favorite grill person again for close which is awesome, man that kid has a crazy life. After that I just came home and... played some Overwatch I think? And today was spent pretty much all day playing Overwatch and a bit of learning about Artifact. A pretty lame weekend I would say! Alright that's all for now. Hopefully Her and I will do something fun together tomorrow. "

Then after that...20...? More years of ""enjoyment""? Max?

What is that song about the exit to eternal summer slacking? And the children waking up and not being able to find them? Is it about teachers sneaking away from their students?

&#x200B;

Imagine if there WAS an exit to eternal summer slacking.

&#x200B;

Just...get off at that exit and never have to deal with a life of rushing to the teachers lounge to warm up a frozen burrito (that you'll have to scarf down while it's still half frozen), nor wearing depends because you literally only have a four minute restroom break (and you're forced to share a restroom with every girl in the entire sixth grade), nor not having adequate time to pump breast  milk for your own child, ever again."

Introweek at school.
-

I didn't have high hopes for the week. David cancelled on me and Jesper had a bruised foot. I mainly took care of the ""childeren"". The group was a lot of fun. The good thing was, was that we sticked together. We spent evenings and our mornings together. When didn't want to participate we chilled at one of our houses, and even watched a movie at the theater.

The feeling of being a leader, of being in front. Being important, it gave me so much energy. Even in mornings with little sleep I could wake up easily because in my head I had to. I had to set an example, and I loved to.

I drank a lot this week and was mostly tired and sick. So I didn't really have time to write. To summarize the things I endured during these days:

- I bruised my leg. Me and Martijn played American football, and he kicked the ball in the sky. I chased the ball looking towards the sky, tripping over a table and bruising my leg. My mobile phone is also curved now in the shape of my leg.
- I puked. But I wanted to, because if you did you'd get a ribbon. I was so proud when finally that ray of sunshine left my face.
- I sang Linkin park ""in the end"" in the club. For me this was an important moment. After asking for it 2 times. They finally put it on. Me and some other dudes were screaming along with. But then they stopped the song for another, but we kept singing, so they turned it back on. Dope moment.
- I danced like a maniac. At one moment I had a cloth in front of my face, and couldn't see anything. I felt a girl and danced like a lunatic with her. I put of my cloth and noticed who she was. The same girl I earlier had a crush on, but she didn't like me. Once noticed I went away, didn't want old feelings coming back. And I did the worm in front of random people.
- Watched the movie blackklansman in the theater, was fun.

HOLD ME TIGHT, AIGHT?
-
In the final moments of the week we held a feedback moment. I stood there in a circle with others, and behind me Irene grabbed me with her hand. Putting it on my stomach, and her face on my left shoulder. I grabbed her hand my right hand and played with her hand. I put my face softly against her head. We stood there for about 15 minutes with other people seeing us. Why would she suddenly do this? Not like I didn't like it. It's just that we don't know each other that well. Every time I see her I give her a hug. But that's all. We never had any real conversations. Despite it all, perhaps it was just friendly, perhaps she was just tired. In any case she felt comfortable enough to touch me, in a weird way I consider this alone to be a good thing.

AIRBORNE WALK
-
Originally we were supposed to walk with just us three. But a day before Lou cancelled. Maxime asked if I would prefer to walk with others or just us two. I said both are fine with me but still inching towards just us two because I want to know her better. We ended up going with the others. The walk was just 10 kilometers. But with my painful foots and bruised leg it was a bit difficult.

It was crowded and I don't really have a close click with the others (12 total). I did have a good time talking with Nicki, but with Maxime it felt off. I said some weird things and overal it was a bit awkward. At the end I was glad it was over. I wished I went with Jisse and his family. At the board night with his family I felt comfortable. In the future I do hope to attent more marathons.


The next weeks I don't have a internship because I still need to arrange something. During this free time i'm going to work on my diary and try to catch up."

It was such an amazing experience that I would never forget in my life! A slow old melody Hindi song and my bros driving was wowza for sure. Then me, my brother along with my father were talking for a long time. So overall, I feel this day was filled almost in every way. And yeah after class myself and my bro went to odyssey and I found a scrambled Rubik‚Äôs cube and I was tempted to solve it which I did. Then I found a good 5x5 and scrambled it and I solved on my own. It was so good. Overall- superb day!

So my birthday weekend was amazing. I met Matt Prater and he signed my hat for my birthday. Lions came back from a 27-6 loss to win 33-30. Got my dress fitted for my brothers wedding. Krispy Kreme for breakfast. Birthday was awesome.

I'm at 2 weeks of not smoking! I've had good support this time and hoping he helps me through it.

I'm so very happy to say the Ghost has officially stopped haunting me. His name popped up and I didn't have to lurch in my stomach. I don't think about him anymore. He's gone and I'm so happy about that.

I've been talking to this guy going on 3ish weeks. We hit it off really well. But, as all good things in my life, it won't stay that way. He's leaving in a few months. So until then we're just letting whatever happen, happen! I would love if he changed his mind but I won't force anything. But I'm falling and know he won't catch me but I won't blame him. He warned me he'd be leaving and not to get attached. Guess I'm not good at listening lol

Therapy is going ok? I don't want to talk about my past issues. Just my current ones. But all we talk about is how my ex slept with my only friend and how its affected me in both relationship and friendships. And its expensive until my insurance kicks in. But I'm going to make it work somehow because I think it can help in the long run, as long as we move past that specific topic.

Well, that's about it I guess. Just a waiting game to see how short this wave of happiness lasts."

Time to do some updating! Monday was a fine day from what I remember of it. I feel like this week is going by so fast already. I worked a bit that day but not for too long and all I did was play with a kid pretty much so it wasn't a big deal at all. What else did I do Monday.... nothing? We might have watched an episode of the expanse that day, we watched that together recently which was nice. Yesterday was really fun. I worked a short shift at work and it was very chill and enjoyable honestly. I didn't do much at all and just hung out with some work friends basically. After that I went home and we got ready for our concert. I wasn't all that hyped for the concert but I enjoyed it overall, it had really cool production and stuff. I feel like I don't remember it super well which is weird. I got Her some merch as an early anniversary gift. We got home pretty late and went to sleep since we both had big adult things to do in the morning. I went to my orientation for school today and She had Her interview. I felt like orientation went well, people were friendly and it seemed I got useful information about stuff. Her interviewed seemed to go well but then at the end of it they told Her She didn't have as much experience as they wanted on paper for the position She applied for...then why did they call Her back? Weird. They did offer Her some other options though and She is waiting to Her back about those and isn't sure if She would want those positions anyway. After I got home I took a long nap, ate some food, and now am about to get ready to go to bed. "

UTI stuff again.

So for a while I just didn't want to go on my laptop because I've been so anxious. The whole weekend (aside from work) I was in bed watching Netflix. I have finished Supernatural (watched it for a couple of months), watched Saiki K (funny), I forget what else...

Last night I was considering going back to playing some video games, something I haven't done in a long time. I used to be just a casual gamer who liked playing RPGs... but eventually lost interest even though I used to game since I was a kid.

Anyway I was super, super anxious. I had to stop taking my antibiotic (Macrobid) on Wednesday, so Thurs - Sun I had no medication. I was thinking that I was going eventually going to go to the hospital, get into sepsis, and die.

I even wrote down my pin number for my bank account in case my mom and stepdad needed money (stepdad had me put in 2.5k into my account since he doesn't have a bank account). I wrote a page detailing the timeline of what happened, from the beginning of my UTI to now.

I had a flare-up on Friday when I just repeatedly went to the toilet. I was drinking water after I peed, then peed, then drank more water. I was getting dehydrated from all the peeing. I still am dehydrated on Monday.

I went to the doctor, told him that I still have my UTI (saw a different doctor at the same clinic last time). I was sore at my sides (infection was crawling up) and it still hurt when he pressed down where my bladder was. I gave him the results of when I went to Planned Parenthood regarding my UTI, so it's not like I was faking having a UTI.

Asked him to refer me to a gynocologist (didn't give me any paperwork or anything), he said should I be getting testing as women should be tested on their health (pap smears and such).

I also gave a urine sample and he told me to call back as the results would be ready in 48 hours, so they'll figure out which bacteria it is and which antibiotic the bacteria would it be sensitive to... I hope I'm not allergic to the medication as well... So I'll call on Wednesday. He also said to come back in 2 weeks.

The medication I have to eat with food, it's called Doxycycline Hyclate. I read around on it after it was prescribed to me and I shouldn't ingest it before I lie down because residue can eat away at the esophagus. So lie down after 1-2 hours and take it once every 12 hours. The pharmacist didn't tell me that after I asked about side-effects, maybe he didn't know... I don't know.

I took my first dose at 1:30 pm so next I have to take it at 1:30 am. And since I can't sleep for 1-2 hours, I have to sleep at 2:30 or 3:30. I have to change my sleeping schedule as I have to wake up in the mornings around 9.

I told my coworker and she was like ""Man you have to have a whole timetable for that shit like an old person"" lol. I mean... I always keep track of time when I need to.

During my shift today I noticed after the first dose that I had a slight headache (not a migraine), apparently from what I read that it's a sign of increased blood pressure to the brain. That's spooky, I felt increased blood pressure in my foot too like it was really pumping. It's not a good sign. Also joint pains in my thumbs and fingers but it went away, hoping it's just a one-time thing. Meds are stronger when taken consecutively.

Hope I get changed on meds that'll kill the infection when I call in on Wednesday.

For now I'm going to keep taking it easy, I need to be less stressed and anxious. Rearrange my room, clean up a bit (it's been getting messy because I was too stressed to clean), maybe play some video games. I was looking up easygoing games that I haven't played in the past but it seems like the gaming scene for relaxing games hasn't been much. I'm kind of picky so that probably also explains my lack of interest in games.

Games I like are role playing games (RPGs). I like customizing my character. Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons is ok, I usually stop playing after I marry a bachelor LMAO. Priorities. The game gets tedious after a while, I tend to favor games that are more based on free choice, dialogue, relationships... I liked Rune Factory 4 for the 3DS (and it was funny). Animal Crossing was a good game too, I played it for quite a long time. Maybe I'll get back into Pokemon, I know nothing about Sun/Moon Pokemon, just the older versions.

Anyway that's all. Back to life. Thanks for reading."

At first I didn't know what was going on. When we were busy I was taking things in my own hand. I wanted that flag and I wanted it beautiful, truly Spanish, truly latin. The rest wasn't really motivated but I wanted that flag to be what I wanted, it pushed me to the limit in a good way. I spent so much time making it unique, and worthy. I was stressing and it didn't end up like I wanted.

 Afterwards we went out and danced and drinked a lot. Jesper got drunk quickly and went to bet early. I danced a lot and drank a lot, and had a good time. So far I have a good relation with my children. It's been awhile since I've danced and felt so happy

8/10. I wished Jesper was a bit more loyal to the childeren, but he payed a godly amount of money on drinks.  ( 80 euro ?) A good day :)"

Alright, time for two more posts! Yesterday was pretty good. What day was yesterday, Saturday? Oh, not much to talk about there besides the fact that I worked all day. I worked 10-12 and then 3-12. What a fun time! I didn't even get to work with any of my work friends because one of them quit, one called off, and the other one just happened to have that shift off. Laaame. It still wasn't too bad of a closing shift I suppose. Made decent tips. I showed and stayed up a bit later than I should have but ended up having to wake up early for a mandatory meeting at 8:30 that only lasted half an hour this morning. Her and went shopping to get Her stuff for Her interview and we also shopped at a store that's going out of business and we ended up getting a clothing display table for cheap that we are now using as a dinning room table and I like it a lot actually! What a deal. There were also some pants left that I wanted but I am waiting to buy because I'm hoping they will get cheaper and they had like 10 pairs of them left so I'm not worried if they run out. She looked good in Her little work interview outfit She got. And She also got some new makeup thanks to the nice people at Sephora. We ended the day getting a few things at the grocery store, giving out kitten a flee bath (we put mite spray on him but it ended up going too low so he needed a bath and was itching anyway), and watching some tv together. A good day I would say. Alright, that's all for now."

Morning - waking up at 14:00

Midday - traveling to Eindhoven to chill with old friends. Traveling was shitty with train, kept making mistakes which ended up me arriving later. Oh, how I've missed them. The simplicity, the nostalgia.

Evening - eating and chilling. Afterwards we went pooling. That was a lot of fun. We kept shouting tacdicks (tactics) when someone made a bad mistake. I haven't cried by laughing in a while.

9/10, would've been a 10 if my train travelling wasn't shitty. I love my friends.

Midday - playing music with Chaline and Jisse. I love making music, the synergy and preparation and the fun in between. I want this to keep going.

Evening - taking 5 2cb pills with Thomas. Absolutely bonkers. Went out in the evening during the trip to get food, that was interesting. Had fun. Never tripped so hard.

LEAVE IT HANGING
~
The intro week has started, a whole week of drinking partying and being out.

It started with David ( my friend and partner ) not coming for Saturday. I figured this wouldn't be a large problem. I can understand skipping a day because the week is so long. But the next day he called me and said he was sick and couldn't be there the whole week. Thankfully I had Jesper able to support me. It feels like a punch that David canceled. Did I make a mistake? Am I not a good friend? I'm sure I messed up.

It's probably the fatigue, but I'm tired. It feels like I am about to break any moment now. I like going out, but everyday with these people is exhausting. I like these people but I wouldn't call them my friends, except for a small few. It all feels so hollow, I can see them interacting. The need for attention, it gets to my head. The others socialize and do things. I miss my friends, who understand who I am and support me.

I feel down at the moment, decided to go to sleep so I can feel better tomorrow. But the feeling of loneliness is overwhelming. Thankfully I have Jesper but at times he is gone leaving me alone. I don't have the energy to communicate with the others. I can't help but feel that I am a asshole mistreating those around me. I am not a social acceptable guy. I feel like I bring others down. The world is great, but I bring it down."

I wish I could just stop going to work. Like, I wish that tomorrow the day would start at work and I would be no where to be found. My lesson power points wouldn't be uploaded to the team drive. My teammates would be rolling their catty little eyes and cursing my name. Soon every one would be trying to call me. But I wouldn't answer.

‚Äã

They'd be calling and texting, emailing. But, I'd never answer. Where would my phone be? Maybe in the ocean or some other cliche thing.

They'd have to split my students up amongst themselves.

For days they'd be calling. The principal would be calling. H.R. would be calling. They'd be calling my husband, my emergency contact. But he wouldn't answer either. ...Would they eventually send someone to my home?

They would never see or hear from me again. I would delete my Facebook.

‚Äã

Where would I be? I don't know. Maybe in Aruba. Or maybe in India. Wherever I'd go, I'd have a million bucks. That's what I need. Some fuck off money.

‚Äã

I would play with my baby and have plenty of time to breast feed and to pump and to feed myself as well. I'd hire some help, so my baby could always have someone to hold and play with him even while I'm eating or doing laundry and and I would have time to reddit and watch Orange is the New Black and I wouldn't have to worry about grammar and lesson plans and grading and editing shared drives and other super tedious shit ever again."

UGh. Sneezing like a biiiiiitch. I must be allergic to something in this apartment but damn if I know what. Today was fine. I worked a little bit. I really should be trying to get more hours at my other job since my main job isn't giving me many, it's just not as enticing when I get 5 dollars less per hour. Anyways, today was pretty good. I am going to be ending seeing one of my clients soon because of scheduling reasons and I feel like my boss should be the one to tell them that and not me. I had some anxiety today but not too much. Oh, I also made dinner for Her and I. I just googled a few of the things we had in the apartment and threw the word 'recipe' at the end and it gave a good result. I was pleased with and She enjoyed it too! Besides that I just watched a bunch of TI. I am behind so I'm watching vods and Her brother thinks it's weird I don't just check the scores and watch live. What savage watches tournaments like that! Anyway, that's all for now. Also, She's super sweet and I'm lucky to have Her <3"

For my uti/urinary tract infection I went to Planned Parenthood. They were nice and good listeners but unfortunately they couldn't prescribe an antibiotic I was allergic to or have taken before, they had a limit on what they could prescribe.

I went back to urgent care and unfortunately I couldn't go back for the same infection twice so I was turned away...

I had already cried it out a few days ago so I'm honestly feeling hopeless. I was eating pho at a restaurant with my sister and I just ate so slowly and lifelessly. My favorite music group released a new album today and I listened to it last night... and then after the doctor visits I barely listened at all.

I was reading up on other antibiotics and I'm afraid I'll be prescribed Cipro from the horror stories because it has caused people nerve damage. I got some nerve damage from Macrobid and had to stop use of it, hence why I went to Planned Parenthood and urgent care again.

My last resort is the ER but I don't have a kidney infection... yet.

My quality of life is suffering. I look in the mirror and I have a dead look in my eyes. I don't know what to do.

I don't have faith in my doctor and his assistants. I'm losing faith in the medical industry. It's not like I want this UTI.

Why are there so many medications with bad side effects? Nerve damage?? Allergic reactions?? Medicine is so scary... I know it's supposed to help... it's a pick-your-poison scenario... be cured of uti but get other possible life changing debilitating effects.

There's a whole sub dedicated to Cipro called /r/floxies I believe. Bad stories...

I'm afraid I'll get prescribed a medication that will adversely affect me and make me become physically compromised and I can't ever do what I want to do again... travel... work... enjoy concerts... simple outing with friends without needing some kind of accommodation... can't do basic things without hurting... I'm basically laying in bed right now because physical activity irritates my bladder and I'd need to pee even though I just did.

Fuck my life.

Edit: oh it's my cake day... happy cake day."

I let the anxiety beast take over my head a bit earlier in the day but am doing better now. She had a rough day so I tried to do some chores around the house so it was nicer for Her when She got home. I also ended up getting Her dinner on my way home from work because She wanted Taco Bell (I skipped eating out and made dinner at home though, go me!). I only worked 2 hours today. I can't live on only 2 hours a week. I will ask my other boss if it might be possible for me to get a few hours next week as I will be needing them. I have bills to pay and I some how start school in 2 weeks. 2 weeks! It is here so fast! I don't feel prepared at all ugggh. Also, She has a job interview next week which is exciting!

Thurs.
Alright, it's been a while! My lack of posting started because we had visitors for a few days (that was my excuse) and then I just didn't do it due to laziness I would say :p which isn't good. But there is no time like the present! Ok. Thursday was a good day. Actually, it was awful. We ended up having a bed bug issue at my job which still has myself and my gf on edge. Her brother ended up showing up and helping me out with trying to avoid bringing bugs into our home. What else did we do that day. I think Her other brother came over and we played some games for a bit? Or we just chilled and watched youtube. A decent day overall.

Fri.
This day was greatt! I worked with my fav client for the majority of the day and then I later go to do fun stuff with family and friends. Me and a lot of Her family ended up doing two escape rooms which were both fun. I enjoyed the 2nd one a lot more and I feel like it was probably the room where I have done the most so far. I didn't do anything in the first one because my gf did everything :p we also ate delicious Mediterranean food which is cool.

Sat.
I had to go to work this day which wasn't too bad, but before that we got to play some games of Pandemic with people. I also went to give a coworker a ride to work (100% out of my way btw) and they ended up not fucking responding and coming out of their house. So that was really annoying, they even had the nerve to ask me for a ride home after out shift (they showed up 3 hours late). I don't know what I did after this shift. I know I ended up sleeping before showering because I felt gross.

Sun.
This might have been the day where I felt like watching a lot of movies? I think it very well might have been. I ended up watching 3 billboards outside ebbing Missouri which was really good, after that I watched Murder on The Orient Express (the new one that came out recently) and I found it to be pretty boring. I also started watching the movie Battle Royle but ended up going to bed before finishing it.

Mon.
This day I didn't work until later in the day so I decided to finish watching Battle Royle, this movie was excellent! I totally get why it's a cult classic and I want to read the book for it now. Afterwards I watched Lady Bird which I can't say enough bad things about. What a waste of time watching that shit film. It's a coming of age story that I could relate 0% to and the ""jokes"" all fell flat. Literally all of them. Afterwards I watched Dallas Buyers Club which I liked a lot. I thought everyone did really well in their roles and the movie was interesting and had good pacing. I did have some worried and bad thoughts about Her and made some questionable decisions but I think I feel ok with everything.

Tues.
Today I also had a rough morning making bad choices but not toooo bad and still having worries about Her and us and stuff. I overthink things too much sometimes and these few days were just some of these times (I think). What I else did I do today. She made this pretty delicious chicken ceaser pasta stuff for dinner. Idr what I did all evening. I might have watched an episode of Man In The High Castle. And I also did laundry I'm pretty sure. Maybe dishes and trash too, but that might have been Monday now that I think about it.

Wed.
Today was fine I guess. I actually got good hours at work (I still need to schedule for the week, ugh.) It felt like a long day of work though followed by a short evening that went by too fast. I made some bacon just because and decided to try making a peanut butter and bacon sandwich which was...dry. The second one I made I added some syrup and a slice of provolone and it was better, especially with mustard. Besides that I've just been watching a lot of TI videos. Trying to catch up on that really quick. Also watched the new Overwatch short which was very underwhelming (not that I care about lore for that game anyway). Alright, that's all for now! Wowie, what a big update."

Morning - supposed to help the group at school but I woke up at 13:00 so I didn't go. Not like I wouldn't gone if I were on time.

Midday - Playing drums, chilling. Calling potential internships, being denied by all of them, again. How demotivating. Calling and just knowing you're getting denied. Made me throw my phone away after the conversation, it was getting frustrating. I am qualified, have plenty of experience and good grades. Don't I deserve this?

Evening - Playing some sports with roommates. Frisbee was boring, enjoyed playing with the american football, more energetic. Having a couple beers with Ilse, witch was fun.

TRANSLATE YOUR EMOTIONS PLEASE

In the evening Ilse asked if I would you like to come over for boozes. She didn't ask the others? Makes me wonder what she sees in me? Am I a romantic option for her, or just a good friend? Either way, despite going in with doubts we actually had a lot of fun just talking. We talked about romantic options, and how she had a crush on someone I knew. Of course I knew who and said so, she is quite obvious in how she shows it. Reminds me of a night when a friend told me she was obviously in to me. I shrugged it off and said she just talked and danced with me because I'm her friend.

All in all I do not wish to pursue a further relation with her. Being a friend like today was good enough. Talking without there being some sort of pressure is more fun.

morning - like I wasn't sleeping

midday - waking up playing some drums, made some real progress with the song. Doing volunteer work for refugees, cooking. Had a lot of fun with Lou and Maxime. Didn't expect that I would click with them that well. We made plans to walk the airborne route on 1 september together just the three of us. Usually I don't stay too long, but today I had a lot of fun talking, even stayed for some coffee.

evening - chilling, listening to music. And as I am writing this agreeing to go out with friends and some other people, we'll see how it goes. I'm going on bike so I can leave early if I like.

EDIT *

OUT, AND WITHOUT
-
So I went out and yeah it was fun. Could I take the night away if I could: yes absolutely. I've made dumb mistakes, seen people make dumb mistakes. No progression at all. Empty, hollow interactions.

The mistake if made? Yeah I grabbed a friends between his legs with both hands and lifted him up. Absolutely moronic. I instantly felt shitty. As reconciliation I gave him my apologies and asked if he wanted to hit me as hard as he could. So he hit me between my lungs at my rib cage, it hurt, a lot. But I guess I deserved it, gave him my apologies more, saying that was a stupid mistake I made, yet I still feel stupid, that is not me. How can I be like this?

The things I have seen. Lighthearted when you see it then. But now afterwards it breaks me down. Seeing people dance absolutely crazy, knocking people down. Seeing someone grind my friend unsolicited by an older man. She asked for help, at first I didn't understand her, but then I saw the hands around her. The old man grabbing her from behind. I took her hands and dragged her away. It makes me remember what Lou said this midday. About how at work men say and do sexual intimidating things. And how it happens often, it is sickening.

So yeah overal this was a good day. Had fun making playing music. Had a lot of fun doing volunteer work, meeting new people and talking with them. And talking with Lou and Maxime. ~~9/10~~. But going out worsened it. Maybe it is because i'm a bit drunk and tired. But I know this night is going to haunt me. *7.5/10*

I was prescribed Macrobid (nitrofurantoin monohydrate) last Saturday in urgent care. It's Wednesday.

It's an antiobiotic for my urinary tract infection (UTI).

https://www.rxlist.com/macrobid-drug/patient-images-side-effects.htm

The side effect that was really bothering me was tingling in my arms and legs, as well as warmth. Apparently it's called peripheral neuropathy - numbness, tingling, or pain in hands or feet. It messes with your nerves. The side effects vary from person to person and in serious cases all feeling can be lost. Or worse. I had tingling for 2 hours in my legs yesterday, tingling in my fingers after I first took it, tingling in my left arm, unusual warmth in my left arm and leg at different times... Also too much information but when I pooped it was also bloody, more so than I was used to and it didn't even hurt.

I called urgent care that I got the prescription from and they said to stop taking it.

I called my doctor and I still can't come in until my appointment on Monday. I was asking whether I should wait to see him to get a new prescription or go to another urgent care. They called me back in an hour and said to go to urgent care. They didn't see anything on my last culture, most likely because I was in the middle of taking antiobiotics while I gave a urine sample. The receptionist also mentioned that I keep getting UTIs and reacting to the medications I've been prescribed... it's not intentional!

I'm so stressed. I have cried a couple of times because of this dumb urinary tract infection. I've been dealing with the flareups for 3 months already. On top of going to the bathroom so many times... I'm worried it will get worse and I'll end up in the ER. I don't have the money for it.

Plus multiple urgent care visits, bad side effects from antibiotics, doctor visits, so much of my time used up because of it. I have to change my eating habits and from researching I have to avoid sugar but sugar is in so many things! I don't know what to eat!

It is so stressful. I'm tired. I just want to get better and return to my normal life.

edit: After I wrote this post my sister recommended that I go check out Planned Parenthood. I didn't know that they also do women's health, which a urinary tract infection falls under. I decided to not go to urgent care for now and will go to my Planned Parenthood appointment on Friday. I called, see if they took my particular insurance, and then made an appointment.

I really hope it goes well... I hadn't cried in a long time and I cried out my stress earlier. I really needed it.

I still am having odd sensations in my limbs from Macrobid, pins and needles, heaviness when walking, slight numbness... can't wait till it wears off in 9 hours-ish. I wish it was easy to get rid of this UTI I've been battling since June. So much health bullshit. At least I know which antibiotics are and aren't compatible with me...

Bactrim - no (allergic). Keflex - yes (can't take it again due to possible bacterial resistance). Macrobid - no (experiencing peripheral neuropathy/affecting my nerves)."

Haven't written in a while. Jetlag makes me only sleep at around 07:00. I already miss my family in Mexico but life goes on. The last time I have written was in London, before I flew back home. In the plane I sat next to a nice youngman. I tapped him and asked how his vacation was, he answered he was doing a internship in Amsterdam. Spoke the entire flight with him, cool dude. Afterwards I gave him a mexican pesos and he gave me an english pence. Thanks John!

Arrived way to late in the Netherlands. My next train would leave at 3:03. I had to wait 4 hours more. Thankfully my friend was able to pick me up. The next day I was back I went on a date. Yeah, with the same girl I wrote about earlier. (2 august) I wrote about how she doesn't have a strong character. When I still was in customs in America, she and I texted a lot. We talked much and she dropped some spicy hints, this was a side of her that interested me. How she wasn't afraid to show interest. So we sort of went on a date. I'm not sure date is the correct word. Either way I don't really care what it was, it was a bland. Sure we talked a lot and playing pool was fun. But honestly I couldn't care less for the stuff she said. It was too detailed and without emotion. She didn't reciprocate whenever I got flirty. Bland. We'll just stay friends.

Been going out a lot since I came back. First day was fun, didn't went long. Second day was ok, but became annoyed by the shitty music. Another fucking cranberries - zombies hardstyle mix, fucking kill me. Atleast it wasn't shitty dutch music.

Been jamming again with my friends. Learning The black keys - Tighten up at the moment. It's good to play the drums again. Had a lot of fun.

Still have a lot of contact with the family. But messaging all, and maintaining contact is more than I can handle. And I still need to get a internship before september begins, good thing is I communicated my difficulties with my school coach. So atleast he is aware.

AND TOMMOROW I'M GOING TO CALL A DENTIST BEFORE MY TOOTH GETS INFECTED AND I'M GOING TO CALL FOR POSSIBLE INTERNSHIPS. Please stop fucking myself over k thx."

I went to urgent care for my UTI again, the one open today was in LA so I headed there to see if I really did have it. Did the urine sample and indeed I do have a UTI.

I have more respect for this doctor because he listened to everything that I said and wanted to be more thorough. Asked why I didn't see my doctor and I told him that I couldn't see him until the last week of the month since he's booked. Asked which medications I took and if I was allergic. He prescribed me an antibiotic that I haven't taken before (he knows about resistances!!). Also I had to get an antibiotic shot in the butt lol.

THAT was awkward, I didn't know how to show my butt - lift my maxi skirt? But the assistant who gave the shot told me to pull the top of my skirt down and I was like... oh. He was professional about it.

I didn't feel like I was brushed off after leaving, which I'm thankful for. My doctor and the other urgent care place didn't seem to care as much...

Anyway while I was in LA I went over to Koreatown to buy some things I wanted. And then I ate and took the medication. It was really hot, I walked the whole way (took the train and then walked) and I was sweating.

After I ate, I headed back home because I was so tired. The medication kicked in because I started feeling unusually drowsy and I was fighting keeping my eyes open on the train (sleeping on public transportation here is a no-no because of thieves).

It took a while but I finally got home, took a shower, and then just rested. I got pain medication with the antibiotic so I don't have to keep running to the toilet.

Also my mom is in the hospital for a kidney infection, so I've been home alone. I haven't visited her yet, I was going to today after I showered but my stepdad already left. So I will see her tomorrow because I'm sure she's lonely. And not getting visited by a family member feels bad if I were in her place. My mom may give me a hard time and though we don't have the best relationship, I care about her... I haven't told her I got a UTI again or that I went to urgent care because she has anxiety and will worry more.

My stepdad has been spending time at home doing things for my mom (cooking food for her, cleaning). My mom also didn't want me to be lonely, but joke's on her I'm always lonely. Just kidding. Okay I get lonely a lot, but I manage. It's weird seeing my stepdad so much because he lives in his own place (for religious reasons, wouldn't want people to keep coming over our place so we live separately).

Well, that's all. I will keep resting. I have work tomorrow but it's thankfully a short day."

I remember being left home alone. All the time when I was in high school. My alcoholic dad would go on days long binges and wouldn‚Äôt appear or call. I remember being pregnant. And left alone. It was difficult. Having a father who was gone and being pregnant by a man who also decided he didn‚Äôt want to be around. I remember opening the fridge to find nothing. A few pieces of bread and a lone egg. Cooked it up and ate it. Laying on the couch with the tv on. I was 16 and lost and looking for someone, anyone. Thank goodness for friends. For on some days there were no egg or bread. I‚Äôd go to friends houses. Hoping their mother was making some kind of dinner or would offer some kind of snack. They often did. One of my friends mom would even pack a to go plate to bring to my father. (Did she know?) maybe just a polite cultural thing. I was jealous. Of friends with mothers. Friends with fathers who had a job. And provided. And were home...

I wasn‚Äôt alone in being less than fortunate. Where we lived there was a lot of that. But i was definitely the worse off on some days.


I‚Äôd love to help. Those in need. What brought all of this up today? My beautiful kids saying they were done eating. But I always have a habit of scraping their plate up and giving them their one last bite. ‚ÄúEat‚Äù, I say. ‚ÄúThere are children all around the world who have nothing to eat. Kids right around here, down the street maybe. Eat.‚Äù And then I remembered. The feeling. Ever been so hungry that you had sleep for dinner? You don‚Äôt want to leave the house or see anyone. You lie down. And sleep.

I‚Äôd love to help. Those in need. But where do you find ‚Äúthose‚Äù? People don‚Äôt exactly advertise the fact that they‚Äôre starving and poor. People who go to food pantry‚Äôs and churches, those are already getting help. Where are the kids of the drug addicts? Absent fathers? The kids where if you‚Äôre the oldest you take care of all the littles? The kids who come from all too prideful families (my dad) and would never ask for anything. Any help. Would never apply for food stamps. Would never go to a food donation center. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a beggar. We are not beggars.‚Äù, he would say. No. Just drunks, I suppose.

I give all I can when I can. I email my kids teachers and say if there is anyone who can‚Äôt afford school supplies that I would be more than happy to buy them. I bring extra supplies and snacks etc for anyone who might have ‚Äúforgot‚Äù. I am fortunate. My children have never gone a day without. I pray that they never do. We have dogs. That is such a privileged thing. We have food. An abundance of it. We have all that we need. This is why we protest. This is why we march. This is why we try. And yet, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm making any sort of difference or enacting change.

I‚Äôm sorry for this world. I‚Äôm sorry for all of the ugly happening. I‚Äôm sorry for the drug epidemic happening and for the poor babies who don‚Äôt have clean pajamas or cereal to eat in the morning. Or the teenagers who have to go out and sell drugs to help their mom pay bills. Everyone is so quick to judge everyone else. Noses up. More compassion please. More empathy please. More love please. If you have, give. If you don‚Äôt have, I hope you have people around you who recognize and love you and give with full hearts without making you feel any sort of shame.

Please feel free to leave some advice or opinions

Monday is my first therapy session in about 2 years. The last time I went, I went once and that was it (for multiple reasons). So I've been struggling with a lot of stuff lately, mainly revolving around being lonely. I know that, I acknowledge it. I scheduled this appointment and hope to stick with it. But the past few days, since securing the appointment, I've had ""better"" days. Not exactly good or great, just better. So it's hard to think of all the things that have driven me to making this appointment. My best friend said to just write anything down I think of so I can remember later to talk to the therapist about. And I have been.

What am I to expect? Is it ok to not bring everything up at once? Or should i try to get as much out as possible? The issues I had last time I went aren't all the same reasons I'm going now. Is it ok that I'm nervous/scared? Sometimes I feel I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but sometimes I feel it's good I'm going. Any input from anybody?"

Ranting.

I suspect I have gotten a UTI again as I have been going to the restroom with little urine. Not as urgent right now, but I used a UTI home test from Azo to test and the color changed to a darker one as opposed to when I finished my antibiotics. Positive for leukocytes (white blood cells) that indicate infection.

I called my doctor for an appointment and I won't be able to see him for 10 days. I want to know the results of my urine culture and to see if I can get another one to make sure that I do not have it again (if the test was false-positive). I mean, it would only be logical to do a urine culture while NOT taking antibiotics right?

And I'm tired of having a UTI for 2 months already. I do not want to go to an urgent care center again.

I really dislike this logic:

1. Urgent care tells me to see doctor after prescribing me an antibiotic.

2. I see the doctor, they say ""why are you here if you have the medication?"" Like... why do everyone (friends, urgent care) say to see my doctor if my doctor's only solution was to prescribe medication? At least he made me do a urine culture, but it was in the middle of taking antibiotics (which can interfere with results), he didn't recognize that I had an allergic reaction to my first antibiotic, and he just didn't really seem to care at all.

I should probably change my doctor by now. I'll do that after my appointment on the 27th."

I figured that I would do a diary. Why not?

____

My cat, Nala, died on Sunday. Two days after an anniversary of my previous beauty, Shira. I feel like I'm not meant to have them. I feel so much guilt for their deaths because I usually just them go outside when I leave for work. Because someone would usually be home to let them in during that time.

With Shira, I found her. With Nala, my husband, Shawn found her..
It's hard got both of us. We both love animals like they are our babies. Our little ""furbabies"". I honestly hate that term. But that's how we feel.

So losing Nala was hard. We're still trying to recover from it. Being in a stressful living situation, this was a hard hit.

Watching Shawn cry was heart wretching. But he was so strong for me. I felt so... I don't know. Watching him practically hurt his body to make a grave for her. He wrapped her in one of his shirts in such a delicate way. It reminded me of when we got her those stupid little cat sweaters and how much she hated it. But I realized she was gone.

After he did all this, he wrapped his arms around me and sobbed.
We cried together for a while. Then we decided to get her flowers like we did with Shira.

I just want her back. I want more time with her. I want to kiss her forehead and scratch under her chin. Watch her jump onto the fence and tease the dogs to chase her. Her cute way of rubbing against the walls with mild purring every morning. Her annoying antics to be let outside like jumping into the kitchen counters or running amok up and down the hall at 5 in the morning. How she would greet everyone that came home at the front door with a loud meow.

I miss you, Nala baby."

I go off topic a few times lmao.

08.13.18

Had the day off. I was busy on Sunday and a little bit on Monday trying to download some some Ad*be programs for free lmao. I just wanted to see if I could do it. I tried before, but I didn't understand the guide the first time months ago because I didn't read it carefully and I was sleepy. But I actually read it this time yesterday, made some mistakes along the way, but I did it! I was so thankful I made a post over in the /r/piracy sub thanking the people behind it and one of the mods gilded the post, it was really unexpected. It was enough having the programs, but the mod went and gilded... it was kind of them to do that as a ""you're welcome"" kind of thing. Actually I'm not sure why they did that, but I appreciate that they felt good enough to do that. :')

After that, I was just chillin on Twitter, learning about doing some color editing on Photoshop by following a tutorial... I like BTS and they uploaded some nice photos on their twitter for their new album release later this month, so I was editing those pictures as practice.

By the way, this [video](https://twitter.com/autumnin1997/status/1029176240333193216) on Twitter for one of the members (the leader) made me laugh, every time I thought about it I just start laughing. He loves finding little crabs on the beach, but the video was edited in such a weird way that it looked like he threw the crab into the ocean (he did not). It just transitioned into him and another member skipping rocks, but the editing made it look like... ""hello friend... goodbye friend!"" * *throws crab* * But he really loves sea animals so much that he doesn't even eat seafood. Anyway... back on topic.

8.14.18

Worked today. Corporate was supposed to visit with an important guy, but I worked the whole day without seeing them (thank goodness). I received a shipment today right in the morning so it was hot. The store was full in the back so I had to wheel everything out to the front. I'm good with my section so there's hardly any issues with it, it's just the workload that's too much given the amount of hours I have plus the number of responsibilities too.

Off topic, when I first received the food section last year, there wasn't as many responsibilities as there are now. More and more food vendors, more paperwork, more food to stock, not great hours because Corporate gives each store a certain amount of hours... I hardly had time to keep up with stocking. Hence why I have an assistant, I kept saying that I needed help and I agreed to have her in my section. It was mutual. She's my assistant, but we get paid the same anyway. One day she will be up to speed, it just kind of sucks that our shifts don't coincide so I can't personally teach her things she needs to know, I have to type everything out and communicate on paper.

But as a result of the rise in responsibilities, I am getting more experience and got irritated with work enough to want to learn Microsoft Excel on my own time. By the way... I bought a key off someone for Microsoft Office for like $15 and it's a legit copy too. Microsoft Office usually goes for like $100+ and I'm just not about that life.

Anyway during my lunch today I went to the nearby boba shop (or bubble tea) since I was craving a drink and something sweet, and I saw one of my coworkers! He works there on Tuesdays so he took my order on paper and gave me free drinks! I expected one as I ordered one drink, yet to my surprise he handed me two drinks! I was like ""Did someone ask for that drink?"" (sometimes people ask to get a drink for them) and he was like ""No it's yours."" I was shook, but happily so. And he was busy so we both said bye, but I was happy. I tipped him the cost for the drink I was going to pay for originally. :)

Oh, and at work there is a rumor among the employees that the store is haunted. Stuff like... seeing a little boy, the backdoor swinging open on its own, the trash can moving on its own as if someone was throwing out trash, boxes moving on their own (like there was something inside but nothing is inside except for products), etc.

My coworker showed me a video that happened yesterday, it was when she was in the backroom by herself and a marker moved on its own as if someone rolled it. I would've tried to debunk it, but it wasn't sitting on top of anything and the shelf was not slanted. But interesting, wish there was something like a shadow person or something more... obvious. But it's just little things.

Regarding the little boy, my other coworker saw him months ago but he was crouched so the cameras couldn't see him. I don't really take it seriously, but I love hearing the stories.

Something did happen to me too while I was in the bathroom months back, but not really a big deal. So I was in the employee restroom doing a numero dos while browsing on my phone and I heard a light knock on the door and no one talking. Usually my coworkers would notice if someone is in the restroom and leave the door alone or use the toilet in the other restroom, so I thought whoever it was must've been desperate lol. I thought I just imagined it so I stayed there, but a few minutes later I heard a few more knocks so I hurried up. After I peeked my head out the restroom door, I looked around and no one was there. I saw my coworkers in the office across the backroom (not close) and I called out to them asking if anyone knocked on the door. Everyone was like ""no"" so I was like wtf. So that's my story lmao, not scary or anything like that.

Back to my day, my ex-stepdad took me home and I talked about how my little sister was sleeping with my other sister's cat. Me and my siblings all love cats. My parents don't.

Background, we have a language barrier as I primarily speak English but they speak Cambodian so it's hard to communicate often times without misunderstandings. I wasn't raised to speak Cambodian nor are there good classes out there.

And likewise there aren't good classes for Cambodian speakers to get good at English, but honestly English is a hard language. People who say that people should be fluent after living the US for many years are native English speakers, so they don't understand that there aren't classes for every language out there, especially good ones. And it'd be costly too as not everyone can afford it. It takes a lot of effort and resources to learn another language in general.

Sorry I rambled again lmao. Back to cats, my mom and ex-stepdad have mentioned that people get cat hair in their nose and have a hard time breathing... but what they really meant is that people can get allergic. But my ex-stepdad called it asthma, which has a totally different meaning. So just imagine me sitting there going ""what"" and trying to explain that people don't get asthma just by getting allergies... or do they. Never heard of it. Oh shit, I just googled it, allergy-induced asthma is a thing. Holy shit. Wow. Okay I give them credit then lmao. I have much to learn about allergies. Today I learned.

Anyway that's all. I half rambled, half talked about my day. lmaoo"

FOREIGN UNIVERSITY
-
visiting UNAM for a possible minor / student exchange. Really loved the school, all the facilities are on campus are free and the area is very large. Once back at home I want to arrange it. If I could I would love to join the faculty American football team.

MEXICAN BONER
-
On the way to the school we were joined by Paco a friend of my cousin's. He mentioned how I shouldn't come here because the country is shit. Pretty much the opposite of my brother who seems to get a hard-on from anything Mexican related, kind of similar to Nazis and the arian race. Hard-ons not because of what it does but of what it is.  Personally I like this country but I wouldn't say it beats other countries. Yeah I like it here, but that is mainly because of my family and the culture.

A HOLE IN TOOTH
Afterwards getting my teeth checked and drilled by my cousin. My tooth is a gaping hole now. In Holland I need to get it fixed, which might cost a lot of money. Funny how one stupid ball to my face caused this.

BACK TO BACK
-
spending my last moments in Mexico with my family. Now it is back to real life. Fixing my internship, fixing my tooth, fixing my financial crap. Life is simpeler when you don't have to do a lot of things. I'll miss it. But I'll be happy to regain my independence and distance myself from my brother. I can't be myself around him, he makes me feel negative, no empathy. I miss my friends. My friends know how I feel, and most importantly respect it and don't see it as a weakness.

Overal okayish day. I enjoyed visiting the campus and going to the dentist. At night I was absolutely exhausted not physically but mentally.  6/10"

Anyways, I had a productive day today at least so that is good. I paid some bills, made a phone call i needed to make, did some scheduling. Her and I went shopping together when we got home too.

""More stuff doesn't mean more fun""

Yeah another lazy day. Had a hangover and a weak stomach because of the alcohol. Just chilled mainly and avoided others, sometimes I need these days to recharge.

In the evening we went out again. We went to a bar with was really expensive. It was boring but we stayed there because it was some guys birthday. He ordered some bottles and sodiepops. I had a glass of rum and coke (which didn't taste good). I didn't really talk a lot because the others had their own conversation and I don't speak much Spanish to just enter conversations. I was happy when my cousin Lucy arrived. We hugged a lot and hold hands and talked. At the end of the evening I was bored and tired and was happy we left, until I saw the check. Goddamn it cost a lot about 400 euros or more. We shared the check which meant I had to pay like 30 euros solely for a rum and coke... fugg.

After that we went home. With 8 people in a car the size of a mini. At home we drank more but I didn't really have much energy to talk. I messaged the girl I sort of like and had a good conversation with her. Recently I made a post about how she and I aren't really a fit. But the conversation brought back old feelings. Sometimes you just want to be loved.

I give this day 1 rum and cokes out of 3. 3.3/10.

Morning - sleeping

Midday - sleeping and watching YouTube vids. I didn't have any energy. We had plans to go out but at that moment I didn't want to. I wanted to lie in bed all night, and I almost did.

Evening - I was bored, my phone didn't have a any charge so I went to the store, Jessica came with, and I'm happy she did. She lifted my spirits. At the store, bought cigarettes with 4 flavours and some cookies to try. Watched a movie I enjoyed (forgot the name, have to ask).

At midnight visiting some mariachi bar. Drank a lot and had fun. Place was bad for my ears, constant singing and instruments. But it was lots of fun, talked with a lot of strangers, it was good to see this side of me again. Lots of Tequila. Looking back I took like 15 shots and some other stuff. Jessica tought me a little salsa dancing.  I talked with the bathroom lady, was fun, she was pretty. Came home around 06:00.

Overal good day. In daylight I did nothing meaningful. The night was a lot of fun. 8/10"

0,"week update, really long post
Lots of things happened this week...

Monday - met with 2 old friends. Kinda lazy to reiterate about Jay but I talked about him in another post. Jay kept changing the topic, interrupting me, etc. Me and Jon were kind of frustrated because we really meant well and were also talking about our own struggles and it seemed like Jay just wanted to focus on playing board games and video games.

Me and Jon were on the same page, but Jay was not. It's Jay's life though, if he doesn't want to do anything, we can't force him to. He also kept trying to tease about my major, which kind of irritated me. I also asked him why he kept interrupting me and changing the topic when I was trying to be serious, it was rude.

A different time I asked him some personal questions that he didn't really have an answer to. I told him that I don't have bad intentions, that I was genuinely curious... which was true. Jay's really closed off, introverted, and not very sociable so it was difficult to be able to talk because he didn't contribute much or express himself... we joke around just fine, but the more serious topics, he avoids. Seems like he just sees me and Jon as people to play with, not take seriously. It's a real bummer.

We had met at Jon's home and he was very hospitable. It was my first time there. Jon said that I articulate ideas verbally and understand what he wants to say without trying to be offensive. Honestly I can be though, not that I'm proud.

We hit up a boba place by the university Jon & I graduated from, after the talk. We also kept making jokes about Jay (which he wasn't upset about, otherwise we would've stopped), and he made jokes about himself too in this video game we were playing (which was like mad-libs).

After Jay left, me and Jon had another talk. Turns out me and Jon have a lot in common and similar regrets in regards to family and how we treat them, it makes me glad that I am not alone like that. I really felt like I was a horrible person, but we both do have difficult backgrounds in our own ways. And then Jon started to fall asleep so I bid him and his boyfriend good night and took a Lyft home.

The driver who took me to Jon's place was quite chatty, he talked about going to a horror brewery after dropping me off and it seemed pretty cool. The driver who took me home was also quite chatty, he was a computer technician with a gamer girlfriend with a fondness for beating Donkey Kong games (I forgot what else). They both were nice.

Tuesday - Worked. I barely remember Tuesday. I did the usual - worked, went home, etc. I was likely catching up on twitter on BTS news and whatnot.

Wednesday - Saw my therapist in the morning, talked about what I went through in the past month. I woke up early to meet her. By the end, I was pretty tired of talking. She mentioned that I've been going out more, which is true. I hardly had a full day of staying home lately at that point. The weather was also pretty hot. I went to a nearby deli and it was good the first time I went there. I don't remember what I got the first time so I couldn't order it again. This time I ordered the St. Patrick's which was roast beef, tomato, lettuce, aeoli sauce (not sure if I spelled it right), in 6 inch bread. It was alright. Nice employees. Then went home and slept most of the day since I was lacking sleep. My youngest sis brought in food for me after I was awake, which was nice of her. I gave her the other half of my sandwich, we often give each other stuff.

Thursday - Worked. My sis came to pick up the youngest for a road trip and they went to the beach before going home in the next state over. There was a fire up north that day so it was cloudy, but humid. The sky was a strange color and so was the moon.

It was lonely without the youngest, so I understand how my mom feels when I take the youngest to go on a trip and my mom stays home by herself (mom hates traveling and freeways, which is why she always stays home but she has my ex-stepdad to keep her company).

Went to the 99 cent store for some snacks since I don't have a UTI anymore and binged on gummy candies like crazy because I couldn't have any sugar for the past month lol.

Friday - First actual day off without plans and it was nice. I was playing some choose-your-own adventure story games since I like that kind of stuff.

I listened to ""BTS - Epiphany"" (Jin's solo) on youtube and I was all up in my feels. I love his ballads. Also Jin is my bias in BTS, I have a soft spot for him because I can relate to him a lot. Plus I just think he's really adorable, handsome, funny, extra, talented, well-mannered, humble, considerate, I can go on. He's been my fave for almost 2 years. I go soooo soft. :')

I also fooled around in some chat rooms. Met a guy who kept throwing a tantrum because people were ignoring him because he kept trying to troll. Said he was 34... lmao.

Today - Worked again. Mostly was printing out and typing up stuff for my coworker (who is assistant in my section atm) and the rest of the employees, assistant manager, and manager.

I'm not in management, I can be, but I just don't like my job or current management enough to bust my ass for them. I used to work really hard, but then my hours got drastically cut because corporate got stingy with hours and realized there was no reward or encouragement so I just stopped caring.

My coworker who was supposed to close the store got an anxiety attack so all the people closing today are all cashiers, which is a first to ever happen the whole time I've worked there (and I've worked there since the store opened). The other floor staff who was supposed to close had another job so he couldn't come in. The manager (as usual was useless and didn't call back the assistant manager), so the assistant manager was struggling to find people to close. I told her that it wouldn't hurt to ask the cashier who was already working. He agreed, she wouldn't have asked if I hadn't mentioned it. I also stayed an extra hour since we would've been real short-staffed.

The cashier who volunteered to close took his lunch and the assistant manager was up at the registers while I was working at the computer in the office still printing and typing up guides to put into a folder for my section. The assistant manager approved of it as she needed to know the information that I already knew.

I work food, which is a lot of work and can be overwhelming. The purpose of the guides were to inform everyone of new updates, how to send invoices and food orders, how to read orders, email and contact information, just details like that. Information like that was always in email instead of actually compiled together. It really should've been done in the first place, but corporate is a mess when it comes to organizing the finer details and just blame others when people don't know what they're supposed to know. Plus the manager not a good communicator, people complain about him because he doesn't tell people what they should know.

During the extra hour that I stayed, assistant manager called me up to the register to deal with the phone while she handled a long line. A lady called asking about her hat that she may have left behind. She described it, worried, and it seemed like she really loved that hat. She said she lived far away, but was in the area. I didn't find it at first, but after we hung up I found it in our go-backs pile and immediately called her back. Turns out the cashier mistook it for one of our items, even though it didn't have a bar code lol. She started screaming out of joy haha. Made me happier that she was happy too.

Anyway I didn't really see this about myself, but the assistant manager said that if I were to be in management, I would be scary. I asked her why (I know that I have a temper but I don't yell at people so I was curious) and she said that it's because I can be strict.

I have heard other things from people that I do get angry, like if they don't do food a certain way. Honestly that was a long time ago, people don't say that anymore, but I can still see that. Food is a huge deal, sometimes people stock when I'm not there and expiration dates get mixed up, drinks are messy/disorganized in the back but neat in the front, etc.

I mean I do complain to whoever's closest by about what I saw, but I don't throw people under the bus or confront them lol. I have also been described as blunt. I don't try to be blunt all the time, but sometimes it is needed... And I mean... I guess. I just never really considered myself as somewhat intimidating. There are people who say I'm nice too, kind, cool... Though I do like to talk to my coworkers, no one really hates me or has a bad attitude towards me... or do they. Just kidding. I have nice coworkers and we hang out sometimes.

Eh.... I just think a lot. Rambling. I feel done now. I've been typing very openly and typed a lot. I kind of talked in excess. Thanks for reading to whoever made it to the end. Good night."

Work came and went, I am none the worse for it but every so slightly less poor. More work tomorrow too. I didn't hang out with Her much at all today. I tried to, but She didn't seem interested.

I have been really struggling with anxiety lately and I hate it :/ I feel like it is just going to get worse when school starts too. I am not sure what to do about it.  I could go see someone about it, but then I would have to pay for any would be meds I might get prescribed, if I even got a prescription. Work sucked today. My job is annoying me lately too. I work from like 9-6:30 most days of the week, well, I'm not home for those times due to work, but I only actually work about 6.5 hours a day usually. It sucks and is making me feel blegh. I also wasn't good with Her today. I just didn't communicate with Her at all really or do anything to help Her. I feel bad. I am going to sleep. Ugh. I am excited for the weekend...the one day on Sunday that I get because I'm back to working 10 hour Saturdays because I'm a push over. Woohoo"

I worked up the courage to join a dating app. Matched, talked, went out, and it just wasn't there for me so I called it off. So I know it's my fault I'm back to feeling lonely but I'd rather feel that than bad for lying. But in the few days we talked, it felt nice to have those kind of conversations with someone again.

The ghost is still haunting me. Close to a month of nothing from him, yet I couldn't stop thinking about him the whole time I'm out on a date with someone else. His name keeps popping up still in my autotext, but I deleted his number. So there's at least that.

I went out with some people from work and that was a lot of fun, as usual.

Went 4 days without smoking. Bought a pack today though.

I have a feeling I'm going to go through one of those no eating weeks coming up.

I'm feeling the...""physical loneliness"" of being single. And it sucks lol

Still haven't called the therapist yet but I almost feel as soon as I can find someone, I won't need one...

Still missing the ghost. Ex misses me.

I finally have the nerve to admit and write about it. Yeah it is my body that is my most fragile part of my ego. I should come to no surprise. I mean it is visible to all. And I know people notice it.

It's hard to admit you got tits bigger than some girls. You are a fucking dude. It is enormously depressing. Memories of my mom thinking I had a body of a girl. Embarrassing moments in the store, with other people. Currently my body is in a better shape. I'm less afraid to put my shirt off. But the scars are visible. I have 4 lines underneath my curves always reminding my pain.

I was close to deleting this text because even now it is hard to admit. I chose to write it because this is my diary, my thoughts should be in this book. And I have to be honest about it. I haven't always been honest, otherwise I would've written this a long time ago.

Next insecurity to write about is my penis size.

""Go down so I can go high""

Morning - waking up was annoying. Constantly noises and waking up because of alarms. My brother woke up on the wrong leg and had a bad moment. Reminds me myself.

Midday - visiting markets in the centre of Acapulco with cousins and nieces. Bought some china and had ice cream. My brother didn't went along, and honestly without being too mean, I enjoyed it. I was happy he didn't come along because I don't want to suffer because of his negativity.

Evening - visiting a ""shopping village"" or as I like to call it ""capitalism ville"". A shirt of a local football team costs a small amount of 1400 pesos. Or 65 euro. A reasonable price for a piece of cloth, right?
~
At night me and the family played hints(?). Of course I have trouble speaking Spanish but it was fun. And according to my sobrino I'm his favourite uncle. And he wanted to play hints on my team so much he cried.

Overal my brother had a down moment that I enjoyed so I could have a moment to be myself and shine. Had fun with my family. I give this day a 7.5. Could be higher if I could sleep. Right now I am tired and the rest is still playing hints at 2:00 AM +

Kicked down and out, the substitute takes place.

""What is wrong with your brother? Why does he sit all alone."" He is probably tired and didn't sleep well.    At least now he isn't hogging all the spotlight. Yeah, how sweet of me to care for my brother like that. Why don't I talk some reason to my brother? Well it's simple, primarily I don't really care how he feels after all those years of him mistreating me. Second, he might hit me or say mean things and my fragile ego can't handle that. Third, he'll probably not listen to me. So for now I focus on myself, and it feels nice.

""Two sides of the rusted coin both of the same material.""

Yesterday (3 August) - such a boring day, we were supposed to leave for Acapulco. But due to complications we decided to leave tomorrow.

Morning - 4:00 leaving for Acapulco. With 11 people in a van. I hate long trips in narrow spaces.

Midday - arriving at the house we rented. Swimming at the beach, not much fun today. We left early because it looked like tornadoes were starting everywhere.

Evening - biljarts and beer in the centre of the touristhub that Acapulco is. Had a absolute bad time, also had a good time. I'd all swing one direction in depending my ego.

Overall pretty OK day. A bit bummed that it has to end with me sleeping in a room full of other family members. I'd rather have some privacy. I give this day a 6.2 /10. But I could've have a very different scoring.

Losing makes me a sour cunt. Winning makes me a overconfident asshole.

We played pool, and I'm not the best but I surely can play a bit decent. All the balls I hit were just horrible, we played in teams and knowing in two games I haven't scored anything besides a ball of our own. I felt bad. I felt horrible. Because I messed up all the shots (and broke a beer bottle) Why can't I just admit I'm playing poorly but still enjoy it with my family. I was just sitting in the corner with a beer in my hand. And yeah here it comes, they are walking over me and asking if anything is alright. ""Are you tired?"", ""Are you sad?"". Well clearly it's yes to both of them. I can't admit it out loud.

And then I start to hit something, and a another one. 4x in a row.
Watch and notice how that fat virgin suddenly becomes more talkative. Didn't he just a few minutes ago almost cried in the corner?

The rest of the evening switched from bad to good. Just because I finally hit something."

Alright, time for another post! the anxiety monster got the better of me again today which is laaame. I am feeling better now though and told Her about my anxieties. I didn't do anything since I got home I feel. I watched a bunch of food youtube videos, and ate a lot of food because of that :p I need to make a lunch still and empty the dishwasher.

This is a post for yesterday! I was just tired and didn't feel like doing this last night and planned on doing it this morning but I totally forgot! Yesterday was ok from what I remember. I am pretty sure that I didn't end up going into work until later than I was originally scheduled to due to stupid cancellations. I don't remember feeling anxious much yesterday (not that I can say the same for today). Her and I went grocery shopping yesterday which was kind of cool. It is nice to have it done with I suppose. We also ended up cleaning some of the apartment up, we did all of our dishes which is good. Alright, that's all for now I suppose!"

Today felt long! Ick, what a Monday. I ended up going into work late again to to yet ANOTHER cancellation. But in good news it will be the last week spent dealing with this as services will be terminated due to a lack of ability to arrive on time. I feel bad about it but I think it will be better for everyone. Work was a pretty chill day honestly, I feel like i didn't do much. Time at home just flew by. I didn't do much of anything fun honestly. I did finish reading the book I was on. Only 2 left in this series and then 2 more after that for the whole universe and I will be all caught up! Man, that's pretty crazy. I had a rough morning with anxiety and feel a bit wound up now, but I just need to take some breaths and focus on mindfulness. Alright, that's all for now."
0,"1. Installing new doors, learning to be content with present
*6 August, 2018*

I desperately wanted to write a diary last week but I chose to finish reading *Eat Pray Love made me do it*. It's not because the book was so interesting, in fact, to be honest, kind of boring. Simply I set finishing the book as my plan, therefore I forced myself to fulfill it. At least, I have learned new phrases/vocabularies.

It had been raining non-stop over the last week; everything looked so dull, cloudy, wet and sad. Except rains in Saigon where they come and go fast and the glorious sunshine appears right after that, my mood is never good in rainy, gloomy days. S doesn't mind raining. He loves it. He cut grass, fixed the mail box, worked on the damp route to the pond under the rain with no raincoat. He works all the time; if it's not on his job, then the house, the yard, the pond or anything related to fixing, upgrading, repairing, building, maintaining or even destroying. In short, he needs to be busy to release energy, to feel important, accomplishments which will make him more secured and his anxiety go away.

Last Saturday, the first doors finally were delivered. S took the old, rotten French doors out, strengthened the bottom door frame and a part of the inside plywood floor devastatingly damaged by rain with wood boards; covered the door frame with asphalt (?) water-proof  sheet - it's interesting to see him use a dust-off chalk line to make perfect straight lines as marks to cut the whole panel into different sheets. Then came the most challenging part, bringing the new doors. It was a huge mistake to underestimate how heavy the doors were; S hadn't asked the delivers to place the new doors closer to the replacing area, as the result, S and especially Daddy R (poor my 66-year-old man!) were very struggling to be able to move the doors 65 feet from the back yard to the front, lift them up on the porch and fit them into the frame. The finishing part, installing the jamb and hinges which will require accuracy and correctness and another full day on the weekend to have it done hasn't come yet. Also paint them. Now, we have the beautiful partly- finished brass full-glass double doors.

During the last week, I watched some videos of Viet wives living in the U.S. on Youtube. Some go to work, some go to school; others stay at home by choice or not by choice, cooking or gardening or taking care of kids or doing all such things. No matter what they do, who they are, how older/younger their spouses are than them, they are happy with their lives, their present, their decisions, whatever roles they chose voluntarily or not. That's the most meaningful to me and what I should learn: be content with the present. I fear S's DUI past life. Now he doesn't drink (he did, quietly behind me, a few times a year and I know this will happen again as a cycle); the projects, the 26+ acre property, the married life keep him too busy to drink,  but what happened to his young years and a very-cautious-but-yet reckless S that I've known of have interfered many times with my ability to enjoy life. I know I am so weak sometimes, but I need to live a fearless, worry-free life. I am working on it. Life is unpredictable; what scares me now may end up not happening but something else. I live means I fight; so instead of fighting over unforeseen, intangible future things, I should keep focusing on what I have been doing now...."

Time for another post! I was just lazy last night and didn't feel like typing then, not a good thing to make a habit of. I've been having anxiety issues for the past few days again and I hate it. Yesterday felt pretty long (in a good way). I got to help Her write a paper She is working on for class (although I don't know how much help I was). I also found all of the books I need for when my classes start and I figured out when my classes actually begin. Everything is happening so fast! Ugh, it makes me nervous. Alright, that's all for now. I need to leave for work soon. "

Had work again today. Woke up really early because of an earthquake jolt. In my sleepy haze, I somehow thought the earthquake happened because I didn't order something at work lol. Also I had cramps... felt nauseous. Was pretty lethargic and dead on my feet. Had some Mexican candy that actually pepped me up until lunch. I was so sugar-deprived as I intentionally didn't eat anything with sugar in it for 2 months (because of my UTI).

Anyway some coworkers confided in me today about what was on their minds, I think they just really needed open ears.

After work, went to Walmart with mom. I usually go off on my own most of the time, but mom really just wanted to talk about whatever. I ended up buying a whiteboard calendar with dry erase markers and my sis was drawing on them when we got home.

Also at checkout, this guy by the registers turned his boombox on and was dancing to Miley Cyrus ""Party in the USA"" lol. All the lines stopped and many people turned their phones to the guy. The cashiers thought it was funny, the managers did not haha. Managers kept getting called to the front. Only at Walmart.

Well now that I'm home and have a day off now, I want to take it easy tomorrow. Still gotta meet Jon and Jay about that serious talk, but at least I can sleep in and have a little bit of time to myself."

So I missed the date as it's currently midnight right now lol. Going to be a really long post.

Anyway, woke up earlier than usual this morning so I'm pretty sleepy.

My friend Jon messaged me about another friend ""Jay."" Not that they'll see this or anything. Jon called me when I was about to clock in at work so he's been pretty patient since I called him around almost 11pm today. Worked, had an easy and surprisingly slow day for a Saturday. Not that I really minded since I was sleepy as heck, but everyone was bored though. Day was kinda fast and kinda slow from a mental standpoint.

Went to Joce's birthday bbq, so I just brought a bunch of cookies and ate some good food. She was a surprisingly attentive host and was pacing herself well with the alcohol.

Kept asking me if I wanted to take shots, but I had to hold off since I had been taking antibiotics and only finished yesterday. I didn't want to risk stomach bleeding so I held off just in case... plus I just started my period so I'm also not going to risk Advil tomorrow while being buzzed lol. People were doing ""cheers"" with their shots and I held up a water bottle and Joce's relative was like ""nah put that down you don't hold up water"" lmaoooo.

I played chess against Eric and I was kind of being reckless, though I did put some thought into it... not too much since I didn't want to take too long making a move. I managed to completely put him in a checkmate without taking too many pawns and he shook my hand cuz he couldn't find a way out lol. Kind of boosted my ego for a bit  even though I got lucky lol. Had good company at the kickback, but had to leave earlier than I wanted to talk to Jon like I said I would.

Anyway after I got home, it was around 10:50pm when I called him back (I was keeping him up to date about when I'd get back to him, didn't keep him hanging). Jon brought up his concerns regarding Jay, what he heard, what he's observed, etc. I was taking down some notes. I do worry about Jay too... we're going to meet on Monday at Jon's place. Jon is very concerned and worried about Jay for various reasons (Jay knows too, it's not a surprise meeting)."

Another week. Another roller coaster.

I almost enjoy the stress at work because it keeps my mind away from the loneliness at home. My best friend is worried about me smoking again. I find it almost hypocritical, but at the same time, helpful. He knows what it's like so its coming from a point of view of experience. But I told him in due time I'll quit. Just not right now.

The ghost keeps haunting me, and yet I haven't heard from him in 2 weeks. I realized when I last heard from him and thought ""wow, it's been almost a month"" until I realized it's just been two, slow, painful weeks. I'm sure he's forgotten about me by now. Yesterday at work, I was in my comforting stress, and just out of the blue, he hit me hard. Suddenly and as painful as if it was a physical hit. Just flooded with the wanting to hear from him again. But I fell asleep and moved on with my night/day. But then, Tonight, I went to text my sister and his name popped up on my phone due to their names having similar letters. That goofy ass picture, the only one he sent me, flashed for just a moment and it was another punch to the stomach. I've thought about joining a dating site or something. But then thought to myself ""if I can't handle what this one guy did to me, I can't handle more doing the same.""

From loneliness, I can't seem to drop my ex as I did before. Sending him small things like a picture of his favorite movie or my dog. Never of me. He can't get that again. But I hate myself because it just needs to end like it did before. I would just block him from everything but if anything happens in an emergency, I have no one else physically close enough to help. I wont fall for him again, and that isnt self pep talk. No I literally know I cant because that ship has sailed. A while ago.

For the first time in months, I have alcohol in my house. Not from sadness, but simply because I wanted beer and it's cheaper to buy a 6 pack than a tab at the bar.

I'm watching the new season of one of my shows. And there's a tense romantic scene. So in start the waterworks... part of the reason I don't drink at home anymore. Just wanting that connection with someone... not just anyone. The ghost..

Seven years ago today, I had my first experience with a friend passing away. He was only 20. In seven years, I haven't gone to his grave, yet I've always wanted to. I remember when I found out he died, I thought it was a stupid joke going around Facebook. And then I cried. For days. Had dreams about him, so real, I still remember the details to the day. I'm going to go see him tomorrow. Have a little talk. We didn't have a lot of moments together but the ones we did were pretty awesome...

4 months ago, I told my sister I wanted to be the new me by my birthday. 3 weeks to go, and I'm not going to make that deadline. Yet I feel like a disappointment because I won't get there.

Monday I'm scheduling my appointment with a therapist. Medication will be the last option as there's a family history of that going bad.

It keeps raining. And I used to love the rain (except for lightning). But now I just look at it and think of the one cliche thing every girl dreams of: being kissed in a downpour. And in starts the loneliness, sadness, depression... I know, everyone says ""don't rely on others for your happiness"" but when making someone happy makes me my absolute happiest, how can I deny myself that?

So, TLDR: Still lonely. Still depressed. Visiting my friend's grave.

It's going to be a long weekend...."

Morning - saying goodbye to coatepetec and my family there. My little niece finally doesn't cry anymore when I get close. When she played with rubber bands she dropped the box. I helped her. And afterwards she said thanks (with her moms help). I was able to give her a kiss and say goodbye.

Midday - in the car back to Mexico. So tired constantly fell asleep.

Evening - nothing much, ate a pizza and watched last chance U. I'm excited the NFL season is beginning soon. It's super American but I enjoy the long season of sport.

Short day, nothing special but sometimes it is nice to know you have nothing planned. I give this day a 5.8. Got some love from my niece. Ate unealthy. And watched TV for like 4 hours.

Creatures that enter your sleep and possess you. Those things cause sleep paralysis and seduce you to do bad things. Figures that move in the shadow and watch you all day. At least so my brother tells me. He also mentioned various encounters that some of his friends endured. I'm a grown man that isn't easily scared. But at night in my bed it creeped me out a little.

Sometimes I wonder I've there might be truly things such as demons or other ""higher powers"". But I know as long as I stay a positive, humble and respectful person I'll be safe."

Alright, time for another post. Today was.... kind of blegh. I feel stressed out about the future and not really knowing what I want to do in life. I need to look into more school stuff. I think I will like my future field more than my current work, and I don't even hate my current work really. I just need to figure out a way to avoid student loans as best as I possibly can. But it is looking like I will have a pretty hefty amount of loans regardless which is going to suck. And now reading more into my field makes me worried that there won't be even good pay to get out of it which is more nerve wracking. Life is hard. I tried to do some mindfulness stuff today though and just focus on the present and I liked that. I will do more of that tomorrow. Alright, that's all for now.

Today was alright. Went to work in the morning, grocery shopped for a bit, then went home.

At work I learned that the robberies might have actually been internal and someone from corporate may have been leaking the info to the robbers. The robbers knew the layouts of the stores and where the safes were being kept. And dude!! 5 stores were broken into since the string of robberies started happening. Seriously nuts. I wonder who in corporate may be leaking the info... but it's not really the first time I've heard of someone in corporate who had a hand in some shady stuff.

The last head of the company was actually laundering money. Another guy in corporate was fired for working for the competitor (double-crossing our company) and he was also stealing money. The list goes on.

Anyway, went to a nearby grocery store with my coworker because I wasn't getting picked up today (mom took sis to the mall bc sis wanted to hang out with her friends). We took the same bus since we live along the same route and chatted for a bit.

Also I'm still recovering from my UTI but good news!! I'm going to the bathroom normally again... I also have 2 more pills left for my antibiotic. I really really hope my UTI issue has been dealt with. I will make the appropriate follow up appointment again next week."

I've been having a rough marriage my wife has cheated and after some time I forgave her and allowed her to move back in. Now she's doing everything like before and expects me not to believe that she's cheating.

I keep saying if I can just get her to answer the big questions that she won't ask herself then instead of this quagmire of pain and doubt there will be an answer. The biggest is also the easiest, are you using the past to help us or to seperate us.

""Today my heart swings""

Morning - I woke up feeling messy, not much sleep and the children are making a lot of noise. I did wake up with a message from the girl I like. We had a decent conversation which made me think.

Midday - we wanted to go rafting but it was too expensive and not everyone could join. So swimming it was. In the jungle there were waterfall ridges were you could swim, a really fun experience. The mountains, the vegetation and the noise.

Evening - visiting a friend of my uncle for my brother who wants more information about vanilla and vanilla products. And driving around town, because my uncle needs to paint it? I don't know and don't really care. I just was there along for the ride.

Swimming was fun but made me very tired. Slowed down the rest for the day. I got stressed a lot because one of my baby nieces. She keeps crying when I get close, and refuses to shake any of our hands. She keeps crying for her mom and demands her attention. When your having a conversation it gets annoying quickly. Overall this day gets 6/10, not bad but nothing special.

And someone commented on my diariy which is think is really dope.

Morning message: how do you (really) feel
-
Waking up and seeing her message gave me energy, my brother noticed my smile as I texted her. I was happy she texted me as it is a sign of affection, but how far does it go? There is two questions I have:

‚Ä¢ Does she like me?
  When she asked what I really wanted to see. I said ""you"". As she followed with saying. ""Yeah, I really want to see you and the rest too."" I know she struggled with that one. I could see she kept writing new lines on WhatsApp. And it took long. The thing is she doesn't have a strong character, she doubts a lot.

‚Ä¢ Does she match with me?
I like women with a strong character. Women with clear goals, but also an open mind, independent and caring. She wants a man who takes her by the hand and shows her the world. A machoman if you will. And I am everything besides a macho, and she isn't feisty, not capable of adjusting to the situation in her own character.

She is a ball that rolls with only the environment directing it. I want a RC car. Something that can go one direction but still change if it wants to."

Alright time for another post. My diet got off the rails a bit today. I just had to wake up for work a bit earlier than usual and I am staying up later so I ate more throughout the day. I also didn't log everything that I ate and I didn't workout (my excuse being that my body is still, but that's not a good reason). I had some anxiety earlier in the day about smallish stuff that I am just trying to ignore. She went to bed pretty quickly after I got home, She was really tired.

Just gonna talk about my UTI (urinary tract infection). It's an infection in the urethra and mine was infected by e-coli. I had been battling it for the past 2 months. Not fun. Basically it's the urge to pee constantly, like 5 times in an hour. It also burns. It can be caused by different things: sex, bad hygiene, holding urine and/or other bodily fluids in, wiping from back to front, etc.

So I slept last night around 7pm and woke up around 9am. I was really exhausted and catching up on sleep and I have been stressed by various things. I've been rethinking some things due to trauma, but that's for another time.

I think I'm feeling better today in regards to my UTI. I used a strip test that shows colors depending on whether it detects white blood cells in my urine. The color is lighter than when I first took the test, which means the antibiotic is working.

And I am pleased to say that I'm not allergic to penicillin!! I am so relieved and happy about that. I will see until I finish the medication to see if I don't have bad side effects. I'm using penicillin medication instead of sulfa.

With the sulfa antibiotic I had muscle weakness, swollen lymph nodes, oral thrush, and a stiff neck. Turns out I was allergic to sulfa medications and I found out last week when I got put back on it and I had an allergic reaction. The reaction was that I had sores in my mouth, tongue rawness, red eyes from swollen blood vessels, redness in my palms, skin discoloration (beginnings of rashes I think), a migraine, tingly lips, and a puffed up face with swollen lips/eyes/cheeks.

Repeated doses of sulfa caused my body to produce antibodies to fight the medication last month and that's what happened. I wasn't allergic at first until about 10 days in. So my UTI didn't completely go away because the medication was being rejected by my body and without the medication, it couldn't fight the UTI.

I also had a swollen lymph node a few days ago which indicates infection, but it has gotten SMALLER now so it means the new medication was fighting the infection (instead of my body fighting the medication). :)

I will test my urine again with the strip on Friday to test for white blood cells after I finish the antibiotic and also ask my doctor for a urine culture as well.

Also apparently the doctor I have is kind of incompetent. He ordered a urine culture in the middle of me taking the antibiotic instead of in the beginning so it won't be an accurate test. And that he didn't recognize that I had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic I had, he said it was a side-effect due to my stiff neck and swollen lymph nodes. I could've died had I chosen to continue the dose the following month, I had the prescription from an urgent care doctor.

Anyway, I'm still going to the toilet a lot. It will be a while until my body is normal again. But it doesn't burn down there right now. It was still burning on Sunday (and today's Wednesday). I have one more day's worth of the antibiotic and then I will ask for an appointment next week so the antibiotic will be out of my system and I can test more accurately.

I want this to be over with, I'm tired of taking medication, going to doctors, doing urine tests... I just want to live life normally again."

Morning - leaving poza rica, glad I'm leaving that hell hole behind. So damn hot. Gonna miss my family over there though.

Midday - driving to coatepetec. I hate long drives, the music gets stale, my leg gets numb and I can't fall asleep.

Evening - arriving at my tio abuelitos house. There is a strange atmosphere here. And one of my young cousins instantly dislikes me and starts to cry when I get close. The other nephew and cousin are strangely nice. And the family here is very rich I think. Visiting the village with my uncle. Confusing, but I enjoyed it.

Overall a good day, very strange but hey, it makes for some good talking material. 7/10

Beers, bakery's and the bolice.

My uncle took me and my brother for a beer. Little did I know that one beer was 1 liter. After that we went to visit a bakery at 11:59 pm. Smoke filled the street from the bakery. And inside where men working who didn't mind us coming inside. A tray with leftover food was in the middle and we were free too take what we wanted. We went on foot and learned more about the village. After that we knocked on bar doors which were supposed to be closed (I think), to get some strange drink. The rest of the evening was us trying to find a nightclub to party at with no success (it is Tuesday). We went and saw (partially) the Nestl√© and coca cola factory and the (evil) story behind them.

The uncle likes to drive fast, which I like too. He also likes to run red lights. Which the police (might?) have noticed. Lights and the sound of sirens where very noticeable behind us, and we stopped. Our uncle apologised but the cops drove further.

I honestly thought we were just going for a beer run.

Pain brings us together.

But honestly as a outsider, or in this case myself. Reading about times that were fun, what fun is that? Talking about how shitty life is, how much you want to off yourself is far more interesting. Or writing about that one girl you really like and how much you want to stick your peeper in her hoocher. People bond more over pain. And people fetish themselves over massive enjoyments. The extremes are what is interesting."
0,"Talking to someone who won't hear me
Tonight I socialized with strangers. Went well, had fun, but I'll never see those people again. They play D&D, you would've had more to talk to them about than I did. And even though it's far from you, I was hoping to see you there simply because it was nerdy. Part of me hoped you would go hoping to see me (knowing how much I love that fandom). And for 1 fleeting moment, I thought I saw you. But it wasn't, obviously. I think about you when I sing now. Which sucks, because I love to sing. I think about your reaction to my bag, how you thought it was so cool. I think about you more than I should. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" run into you over the weekend, but I didn't. More angry, imaginary conversations with you today. And when I hear someone describe someone, I try to pick out details to see if somehow it's you. I know I'm crazy. Maybe call me obsessed, I don't care at this point. All I know is something change within me because of you. I was almost done with you and then tonight just sent me crashing back to Planet You. I don't want to wear that dress from our first date. I don't want to see Jurassic Park again. I don't want to go downtown again. I don't want to do any of that. Unless you surface me from your memory banks.
You made me feel forgettable. You made me feel stupid. You made me feel like I was nobody...
You made me feel happy. And joyful. And like the light was back in my eyes and the spark was in my smile. You made me feel safe. And adored. And pretty.

And you don't care. But if you knew all this, I tell myself you would care, tremendously.

If by some random chance you see this... I'm sorry."

How it it already Wednesday tomorrow? I really don't understand. Anyways yesterday was ok. I only worked for like 2 hours though which is kind of sucky. Today I worked more (less than usual still) and it felt long. I think I need to just quit playing Overwatch after work. Yesterday Her and I ate chipotle for dinner which wasn't that great. It kind of tasted like tuna salad which is really bizarre. Ugh. I feel sad and frustrated for stupid reasons right now and I don't like it. I had some bad thoughts both today and yesterday. I need to get that under control. I exercised today though which is awesome. I don't feel like working tomorrow. I need to find something to eat. Also, today I got some free food which is good. And I am really under on my calories so far today which is also good. Alright, that's all for now. I am tired of typing. blegh."

I'm getting ready to the better travel of my live, hitchhiking, without money around 8 countries at South America. I'm waiting for the summer to start. While it don't happen, I try improve my spanish skills, self-development, mindfulness, bodyweight skills, and save money (but I won't use travelling).

I hitchhiked 2.000 Kilometers and while I'm living at a big city. This month I became so antisocial, maybe because the people here only job, sleep, job, and do it again and again.

But I enjoyed the beginning of the month. I visited my old friends and hang out at differents places that we don't knew. I was to some parties, it was crazy and fun haha And now I'll continue enjoying only at house.

Work pretty much sucks. The environment sucks. I like most of my coworkers, but the management styles of corporate and such leaves much to be desired.

I don't expect management to kiss my ass or anything. Just treat me like a normal human being, with respect and decency like you would a colleague.

Went to a meeting today and one of the guys in corporate just started yelling to the room of managers and employees: ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS. I DON'T CARE IF-"" blah blah blah. I don't care either, I don't even know his name, his words are irrelevant to me as it didn't apply to me anyway. It was about doing bank deposits because a string of robberies have been happening by criminals (not internal theft)...

It's the attitude that really makes me hate my workplace. I don't shout at people saying ""I don't care,"" honestly nobody may have said anything but we don't care either lmao. Like if you don't care, I don't care. We only get paid minimum wage anyway, aside from the managers.

Like it's been said, people quit managers, not jobs. Applies to the upper level. Three people in HR have quit in the same week, that really says a lot.

Also saw an email last year that had an ex-manager talking shit about someone in corporate, which I thought was hilarious and I actually sent the email to myself to laugh at later. Of course I covered my tracks and got rid of the evidence that I sent it to myself. Like I'm not the only one who feels this way. But easy pay, pays a little more than some other places, and flexible schedule. Got comfortable. Also I got sick recently so I had to hold off on building hard skills.

Our corporate has this kind of attitude where they don't tell you everything, then tell you when you needed to know earlier, and a minute later they shame you or make you look like an idiot for not knowing. Even though they say ""If you have any questions ask us."" Like sure tell me but don't be condescending about it. And they don't properly train people or inform people. Not even the manager knew everything he should.

And lmao the manager was trying to send his assistant managers to other stores (probably to upwards hire his favorite employee) and the assistant managers were like... nah. If they had to leave, they would've taken either me or the favorite because we know our shit (I've been an employee for 3.5 years and I do my stuff). But anyway it's a dead-end job, there's openings for upwards mobility but hell nah. If they treated their employees better I would've considered it tbh. Or open another location in our city and I'll consider, but I'm not going to another city for shit pay and shit treatment.

Plus they've been scrambling to up their security and get their shit together like I've been saying since I almost got my ass beat by some thieves months back (I got their pictures on my phone, which is why they targeted me). I stopped closing since then. And now that robberies have been happening we finally get a security guard... but only after closing hours.

TBH I'm so sorry for that security guard, I met him today and he's kind of an old guy... the criminals are strong and can likely beat him up. Our store might be targeted soon because they're getting closer to us. But we'll see..."

""Constantly thinking, what on earth do they say? It requires energy.""

Morning - breakfast at some restaurant, my uncle was talking to me, but he is hard to understand, I love the man, but he kept on talking. I want to follow, but a different language and hard to understand, it requires a lot of energy.

Midday - to the beach once more. I am officially poor right now with a balance of 0 pesos. The beach was fun, nothing really special.

Evening - driving back home and eating quesadillas. It seems like I have a better connection with my niece now, which I like!

My Spanish is getting much better, but it still requires a lot of energy to listen and talk. At the end of the day I'm exhausted.

HOUSES AND MONEY
Metal plates as roof, open holes in the wall, no faucets. No TV and the garden is just a slid next to the open wall. The floor is concrete, and the wall is just bricks. I just realized how accustomed to modernization I am.

Sometimes I get the feeling that my Mexican family thinks I'm rich. Which I assure you I am not. In fact I constantly stress over my financial situation. It is not because I'm unwise with my money but because I am a student and pay for everything myself, without a steady income. The thought of having to pay back my student loan later haunts me.

My aunt jokingly said I should get a good job and buy a luxurious house here close to the beach for my future wife and myself. So I can share it with the rest of my family. I know she said it jokingly, but what does she aspect that in the future I'll be having multiple houses? Right now I feel pain for looking at the prices on a menu card at a simple restaurant."

Negative first, to get it out of the way:
- I've gone from neutral about him to almost mad. Part of my process I guess. I keep going through all these imaginary conversations I'd have if I ever got the chance. Yet I still find myself obsessing over simply how he made me feel. I could practically see him last night as I went over one of these conversations. Can't help get a tiny bit hopeful when my phone goes off, especially late at night.
- I'm angry at being alone. Not just in a relationship stand point, but just in general. Mad at all the people I once called friends. Mad at my exes. Mad at him. Mad at my coworkers. Just....mad. Hurt. Confused. I don't do well with no having answers, and I have a lot of unanswered questions. All boiling down to one simple word. ""Why"".
- I'm getting very unhappy with how I look. I was ok for a while. I guess because I wasn't eating after he ghosted me. And without a scale, I guess I thought I was losing the weight I wanted, even though not in the right way. But once I catch up financially, I want to start trying again. I just have no will power. And my only workout buddy only likes to really talk about the guy she's (emotionally) cheating on her husband with.
- My dog doesn't even want to be around me anymore.
- $575 behind in bills.
- Back to smoking, already.

Positive, to end on a good note:
- My raise from Friday was actually activated last Monday so I'll have a full paycheck this week with a little bit of OT. Hoping that helps.
- Going to see my favorite football team, on my birthday. Big-ish deal when they're across the country and rarely ever play in my home state.
- I'm baking a pie (at some point) for my boss. I love baking, so I'm hoping it helps take my mind off things, even for a few hours.
- Had a good weekend with my brother and his fiancee. Though it does remind me how alone I am sometimes.
- Stressful day at work, but the increase in pay made it easier to push through.
- Thought I was more in the $700s behind in bills, so I'm not as bad as I thought.
- Too broke to buy more cigarettes after this pack, so that's good in a way.
- Trying to get my life back, even just a little insignificant change at a time."

""one beats many depending on how much you care""

Morning - visited the house of Tio abuelito Lalo. A bit weird, I have a weird connection with him. Although I feel blessed that he cares for us to visit his house. His energy at his age is inspiring.

Midday - visiting the centrum of poza rica, bought some souvenirs for friends and family. The markets made me feel dizzy, it is so crowded and small.

Evening - dinner and karaoke at tio Angel's house. I had a real good time. I keep meeting family members I've never seen.

Veracruz, poza rica. The place where my mother grew up with her brothers and sisters. Although my mom is gone, her family is what she left me.

HOMESICK (a little bit)
-
I know what I miss.
I miss my friends.
I miss playing the drums.
I miss watching TV series on my own.
I miss the opportunity to be alone.
I miss the opportunity to go to the bathroom with privacy.
I miss being able to exercise and eating healthy.

And honestly that is about it. I tell you what I don't miss.

The mess our student kitchen can be.
The heat and drought in the Netherlands at the moment.
The financial/internship stress
Being alone constantly and isolating myself.
Eating mediocre food.
Being bored a lot and not knowing what to do.
Mainly the hole of feeling alone and confused.

KARAOKE WITH LOVE
-
""Karaoke, again?"" As my aunt whips out her microphone. My family loves karaoke it's the third time in two weeks we've done a karaoke night. At first only two aunt's were singing. Of course they pressured me, and after a few beers I wanted to sing. Later in the evening my uncle and I stayed outside while the rest of my family is inside. We've already sang a few songs. But we kept on singing. Songs like ""like a stone"", ""kryptonite"" and some Mexican songs. We both can't sing well. But together it was fun. I am glad we had such a good time together.

BAD WRITING

This would have been Thursday I believe. I am trying to remember why I didn't post this day and I really am not sure. I know that I got home pretty late from work, maybe that is the reason? Oh. I also had a lot of cancellations for work earlier in the day and couldn't move any of them up which sucked. But what did I do that day? I think I might have played some video games. I don't think Her and I watched anything though. But I feel like we did something fun. Idr anymore. Anyways, it was a good day overall I think.

Part 613
This was Friday! This happened to be a great day actually. I a short day due to more cancellations, which is really unfortunate honestly. I need more hours but there is no way for me to get them. But I was able to get off of work earlier which was nice and then Her and I cleaned the apartment up nice and good. Then some of Her family got here and we played a short little board game for a while before heading off to another escape room! No one else in the party except for Her and I had done one before and it was cool to have such a large group. I still feel like I didn't help much which isn't that fun :/ but we did get out! Alright, that's all for that day.

For Her part 614
Another solid day but it did give me some anxiety. Well, first we spent the morning planning to look around at different car lots for Her with Her brother... but She ended up getting one at the first place we went :p She seems happy with it and if She doesn't like it well the lease is still up in 2 years anyway. Live and learn. It's a nice car though. After that I had to go to work which was ok. One of my coworkers made me anxious but I told Her about it and I'm just being crazy. When I got back everyone pretty much went to sleepy shortly thereafter. That's all for that! Oh, I also made killer tips at work.

For Her Part 615
Ahhh Sunday. My one actual day off. It was good. We all woke up early and went to the zoo near us (which I've never been to) and it was pretty cool. I don't love zoos, but they are still kind of fun. After that we got lunch at a local buffet and then Her family had to drive back home. Her and I got some groceries and cleaned our vehicles. We also ended up getting pizza for dinner which was delicious. Her and I just did our own stuff for the night, I should have done something with Her. Well, I need a shower.

Evening - visiting the centrum for dinner and buying stuff.

I haven't written much in my actual diary, I tried to write some at the beach, but I don't enjoy writing with other people next to me. And in the mornings or evenings I don't have the time or energy to write and draw. I'm 3 days behind now.

DEATH IS GOOD
-
During my visit at the beach I talked with a very nice Mexican hombre. We talked about various things such as: languages, his family, and beers. When we talked about beers he gave me one to try, and after that another. Before you know it I've got a good buzz going on and I start to talk more like I normally do.

When he mentioned his family the topic of his wife came up. When she went to visit the sea. The man told me how she was 10 months sick, and hasn't got long to live anymore. A bit weird, but death is part of the Mexican culture. Still, it makes me a bit sad that this nice man might lose his loved one. He seemed to love to have conversations. And talking with him lifted my spirit up, I too should talk with more people.

Thanks for talking with me se√±or, I wish you and your family the best.

UP DOWN, DOWN UP

Goddamn, from being suicidal to ""oh wow life isn't too bad"". How fast things change. Maybe it's just my bipolar acting up. Either way i'm in a good flow now, and I'm getting drunk on it. I've been chatting with my aunt's, chatting with random people. Overal: good shit. Although in the morning it wasn't too good, in the literal sense. It's these chili's man. Fire in the hole.

PINA COLADA WITH VODKA AND PERMANENT PMS
-
One of my aunt's is a true firery woman. I haven't got a good connection with her. But today we connected a little. I helped her by choosing a pair of sunglasses. Using my uber design skilzz, I mentioned how the outline of the glasses fits her face better than the other. She seemed to appreciate the opinion.

It's hard to understand her. She doesn't seem like an angry or mean spirited person. She looks rather like she is stressed. Which I understand as she has two young children and a husband who is away a lot. But boy, I had a taste of her pina colada and it's safe to say she wasn't humble on the wodka. I like alcohol but damn, that stuff was on another level."

Morning - preparing to leave for mexico city
Midday - chilling at Tia Gloria and watching TV  with nieces
Evening - taking the autobus with abuelita and Niels

One thing that I have learned here in Mexico is the warmth of the people. Hello and saying heartfelt goodbye. Giving your uncle a hand and a hug, your aunt and niece a kiss and a hug. With my nieces I notice the ""warmth"" more. It almost like they are your girlfriend; holding hands, giving hugs, leaning against eachother and sharing a lot.

I notice how cold I can be sometimes. Eventhough I know that I can be a warm person. I can be friendly, I can share, tell good stories. But I close myself if I can't show who I really am, if I am at the bottom, if I am not ""cool"", because I barely speak their language. I say nothing and hide in the corner. I mainly notice this in the company of my brother. So far he hasn't shared anything positive, the only things he shares is negativety. And he doesn't slowdown on it. The negativety is where he gets his pride, his proof that he is higher than other people.

At home I am too cold aswell, it is not who I am. I am not the cold, heartless calculist that people think I am. I am the guy that laughs with a big grin, that shares, and wants the best for everybody. I will find him again.

It was pretty fun though. A lot of the people that I like working with the most were on my shift so it was a good time and not too stressful at all. I need to take a shower but I think I'm just going to do that in the morning. Her and I need to go grocery shopping together tomorrow, ugh. Alright, that's all for now. "

Why am I not sad he left? Earlier this week, he was so mad at me for something I didn't do. I was upset that he didn't believe me, but I never cried. Last night while I was at work, he packed up his kid and left my house with no text or call, he didn't respond to my text til this morning. I'm still not sad. I don't have any urge to find out why. I'm more upset that I spent so much money at the grocery store yesterday to feed all of us this weekend than I am that he left. Is it over? I don't know, but I do know, right now, I don't care. He's my best friend, not my bf, it's not a break up. Friends do drift apart."

Today was an ok day overall. I know I had some bad thoughts throughout the day, but I'm feeling good now. Today went by so quickly and so slowly at the same time. I feel that, overall, this Summer is sprinting by though. My hours got kind of weird at work today but ended up working themselves out. I didn't get home till 7ish because I worked till 6 and then picked up pizza for dinner for Her and I. We didn't really interact much this evening and that's on both of us. We are going to get up early and go to the store though so that will be something. I just spent the evening watch twich and youtube videos and redditing. Nothing of value gained and kind of a waste of time tbh. bleh. Alright, that's all for now."

Disgusted and horrified. I just woke up to a cockroach longer than my index finger crawling on me. I was sleeping with the lights on because I had dozed off while browsing on my phone earlier, and I also had the fan on because it‚Äôs hot. My hair is pretty long and the fan causes it to constantly move around and tickle my face, my arms, neck, chest, etc. so I‚Äôm always thinking there is something crawling on me when there really isn‚Äôt, but then on the other hand bugs will land on me/crawl on me and I won‚Äôt realize at first because I assume it‚Äôs just my hair. I think that‚Äôs what happened because I didn‚Äôt realize anything at first, but then I turned over and heard something moving and when I opened my eyes there was a HUGE fucking cockroach right next to my face trying to run away. I literally squealed and jumped out of bed so fast I don‚Äôt even remember doing it, also probably because it was less than a second after I woke up. My vision is really bad and the lighting in my room is pretty dim so I can‚Äôt really see any details when looking at my bed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was still there, so I stood there watching the bed intently for what felt like ten minutes, but in reality was probably only like 2. I started shaking the blankets to see if anything would stir, and then I heard something moving BEHIND ME. The cockroach was in the corner of the room and I could literally hear it crawling because it was so big. I probably looked really stupid, my natural reaction to cockroaches for some reason is to hop around from foot to foot saying ‚Äúew ew ew‚Äù and cursing to myself. I grabbed a shoe and tried to kill it but missed the first time so it started running around all frantically and I was screaming and swinging away with the shoe. I kept smacking it even after it appeared to be dead because I have seen cockroaches play dead, only to jump up and try to run away again. I also grabbed the only bug spray I have which is a raid bug barrier spray and sprayed the cockroach with it a little. Then I sprayed some around the apartment and all the entrances as well. The cockroach is still laying where I killed it but every time I look at it too closely I let out an involuntary yelp and jump back, it seriously gives me the worst fucking heebie jeebies to know that giant thing was crawling on me while I was sleeping. And to think that if I was sleeping with the lights off, I wouldn‚Äôt have even seen it. There have been a lot of weird insects around lately, especially after the recent storm. I have been finding them both inside and outside, huge creepy bugs, but cockroaches I cannot handle. NOPE. I‚Äôm hiding out in the bathroom because I don‚Äôt want to go back in my room and I don‚Äôt want to go back to sleep, or be anywhere inside this apartment right now for that matter. My roommate isn‚Äôt home, I‚Äôm home alone and freaked the fuck out. I‚Äôm so sleepy but I don‚Äôt want to sleep. I think I‚Äôll just take a shower because it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll feel safe and clean right now."

Three weeks into texting with me he revealed his undying feelings of love for me. Well, not undying, but what's wrong with adding a little flavour?

I told him I think he's an utter idiot and should put more tact behind the use of such words, mature.

I was involved in a relationship at that time. For nearly three years, no less, at the time we exchanged our first words. I was commited to make it work, convinced it was endgame.

He said he understands, the lunatic. And should I ever part with the man I was, he addressed me with a plea to give him a shot. I said it's not like that will ever happen, but if it makes you feel at ease, sure. In three weeks it will have been one year since I started officially dating him.

The relationship I had before him fell apart just on the brink of four years. I waited a few months then gave him the promised shot, letting it be known that he's the type I'd bang a few times, but not actually date.

I still don't understand our dynamic to this day. It's a type of love I'm not accustomed to, it cannot compare. I absolutely must analyse this phenomenon with more efficiency. What exactly is it that makes him so dear?

I should probably sleep."

Am I really going to post my thoughts for the whole world to see?

Sh!t

This week has been rough. I am on vacation from my job which is a typically involves going to work before the sun rises and leaving after the sun starts to set.

You may think, hell yeah, this girls out enjoying summer.  She‚Äôs probably soaking up that Sun, floating on some waves or hiking up a freaking mountain .

Wrong.

I haven‚Äôt left my house in days.  I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs keeping me trapped here.


I‚Äôm unhappy with myself. I don‚Äôt believe the world should get to know me.

I have zero friends. I mean zero.  Sure, I‚Äôve gone out to bars,  sang  my heart out at karaoke, even joined a social sports league,

 I found myself sitting alone at table.  No one interested in getting to know me. No one wanting to see how I‚Äôve been. No one wanting to know what‚Äôs new in my life.

I‚Äôd approach someone I‚Äôve met before once or twice, ask them how they‚Äôve been. They‚Äôd politely say good and walk away.

It sure makes a girl wonder? What the f*ck is wrong with me? Am I that terrible.

This takes a huge toll on my psyche. It‚Äôs probably why I don‚Äôt leave the house.  I should probably be in therapy.

I find myself binge eating to fill the void.  Often times it‚Äôs pizza or a burger and fries.  I never reach for the healthy foods.  I do make the effort to buy them. I have decent meals all planned out in my head. But in reality the food rots in the fridge until I inevitably have to throw it away.

I feel like I‚Äôm going through the motions of life but not truly living.

0,"And so it begins
I've never been one to write great introductory words.  *Start at the beginning.* What a cliche and thing to say, the kind I welcome only to eagerly dismiss. Is there ever such a thing? Albeit I might be under the influence of my studies, I feel as if it's the best stance to take, it's disburdening. If I take that time *per se* is a form of measure (in the sense of papa Aristoteles and his musings who seemed to have a huge problem with Timaios back in his day) that measures the distance in between *then* and *now* it would seem safe to say that in a way it's a mere tool we invented for us ourselves, as per habit, to make our living more pleasant by putting it into little organised brackets. Clarity, structure, practicality.

&#x200B;

Sure, it's really handy, I'll admit every *time*. If you want to play God and mix and match some equations in physics, wake up for this or that obscure reason at a certain o'clock (why  sleep anyway?) or set an appointment for whatever dreadful deed you're about to commit in a way that you and the other guy don't miss one another. But honestly, what about those moments when it feels as if time is out of space? In the above mentioned situations it seems to be in that place, exactly where it should be. I used to smoke weed every now and then in high school, it is no untold truth that it makes passing feel very fast, but then you whip out your whatever means of counting time and you realise only 15 minutes had gone and during you went from confused teen to some sort of protophilosopher, a thinker of life and and all things yadayada. I never enjoyed the feeling anyway, I prefer my throat not dry and my thoughts boozed, should they be influenced by anything mind-altering or intoxicated at all to begin with. Then of course, there is an entire collection of #inspirational post friendly sayings and the corny situations you find yourself saying them in (yes, I've been guilty, too) such as ..*time sure flies with you.. time goes fast when you're having fun..* Speaking of an obsession with measure. Pretty jeopardising situations, those are - for said measure, of course. I don't pride in writing Yoda-style, but sometimes it just feels like it fits, does it not?

It happens too often that something vastly applicable to science and day to day routine just doesn't fit into the whole picture and as soon as someone points to that difference they feel as if on the path of a poet in becoming, a dreamer. I've always wished to learn how to write in a less scattered way and a more cohesive one, but that would merely expose me to pretending I am already assured of and oriented towards the outcome. It's not about being indecisive, more so about being infinitely open in all directions. Why forcefully strive for an ending or resolve when there are options as handy as a cute, 'simple' aporia? But halt, silly me -  simple is what makes it all so complex, which is actually a good thing. If only I knew how to trace back through the complex to reattain the simple. Note to self; time to start laying out some metaphorical replacement for breadcrumbs.

&#x200B;

Back to the topic if there ever was one to begin with. I believe that there is and should be no such thing as temporality in the sense of measure. For speaking and referring to that, which *was* before and  declaring that which *will* and is yet to take place, is done always and with no exception within the present. Therefore all manifests itself within said present - future and past. It may sound like the type of knowledge tacky Latin phrases such as *Carpe diem!* stem from, but no. As long as the word *diem* stands for *day,* I won't be fooled. For me there are no days, nor are there years. There's only now, now being the only constant, and the brief sense of passing, the awareness as one now fades into another and so on. Sometimes one now can stretch for a bit longer than the other. Time is all events concentrated in a certain space, all manifesting themselves in the temporary-eternal now in all of their grandeur. That is why I've always been one to carry all things with me through the entirety of my life, willingly or not. It used to be a pain, so I decided to become a student in the art of not recepting feelings.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hard to reboot my urge to write.  It's on the brink of extinction, hanging by a loose thread. And I really need to brush up on my English, it's gotten too rigid. Especially if I am to commence my studies in a foreign country next year. I told myself I'd write about me and attempt at a deep, structured delve into my psyche.. but I just got tangled again. Written words that  start uncontrollably forming longer sentences really are the most comfortable sanctuary.. if you let them go free and assume that role. Perhaps I'll delve into mentioned psyche during another now."

It was hard getting through to my little cousin.

She doesn‚Äôt like being hugged or kissed or touched.

Not used to it, I guess.

But I was home alone until my aunt and uncle left her with me, so we had hours of uninterrupted time to spend together.

We did colouring.

Played hide-and-seek.

Built a pillow fort behind the couch.

Each time, I kept getting closer.

Eventually, I won her over.

She was tired, so I put on her favourite Disney movie soundtrack and sat with her on the couch while she played a game on my phone.

She didn‚Äôt want to talk, so I didn‚Äôt say anything.

But whenever she looked at me, she saw I was still there, still watching, still interested in her.

So she started showing me the screen, so I could see what she was doing.

She needed help with a level.

So I said: ‚ÄúLet me see.‚Äù

And I patted the spot next to me on the couch.

She scooted over, and held out the phone.

I thought she would pull away again.

But she stayed.

Maybe she caught my surprise, because she looked up at me in confusion.

Her tiny, knitted brow asked: *Is this ok?*

I smiled down at her.

Kissed her ringlet-covered head.

Then wrapped my arm around her and pulled her in even closer.

For a moment, she froze.

Then I felt her little muscles relax, and she snuggled into my side.

She rested her head in the crook of my shoulder.

I rested mine on top of hers.

She sighed.

It was the gentle kind; one you take right when you get comfortable, seconds before you fall asleep.

I took one, too.

And the world slowed down.

And the noise in my mind went quiet.

So much had changed. Especially my perspective on so many things.

Subtle things I can‚Äôt explain.

I‚Äôm in love with freedom. I love my family, but I love freedom in a different way.

I still have a hard time getting to sleep. The dark thoughts creep in. Yesterday I started sobbing reading old diary entries.

It‚Äôs insane to see how much has changed. Good and bad. But the thing I realized the most is how much I miss F.

But then I start wondering if he even gives one shit about me. He gives shits‚Äî lots of them. I just refuse to believe he could give a shit about this piece of shit.

I can‚Äôt wait to see him again.

Being at art school has put a totally new perspective on art. I know I have to learn to be true to myself. My real self, not some projected self. If I want to survive and make real art. I need to be real.

Yesterday I jokingly said I‚Äôm pretty much in the AF fan club.

It‚Äôs kind of true. I wish I weren‚Äôt so obsessive but still. I‚Äôve said this 100 times or more by now.

Sometimes I think he came into my life to give me support during a rough time. I really like how loving he is with me and how we used to listen to podcasts everyday. We don't do that much anymore and I feel like he's less of a friend now and that makes me sad but we talk three times as much. I really miss Greg we just fit together and there's nothing but calm and love between us. I shouldn't be upset but I actually am that j messed up my sleeping schedule a lot.  Should be happy somebody wants to give me this much attention but it's almost turning me off. A couple weeks ago me and Greg talked about how we never have ssx  anymore but really all we had to say was hey our medicine kills our sex drive and we're okay with that and I actually am. J thinks about sex a lot. Ii feel like an object to him sometimes which is gross. My dogs hate him and especially hate his voice. J and I fight quite a bit and I'm really not used to it. Me and Greg never fight and I can only think of mine time and it ended with us both crying and becoming closer. Sometimes I think j just likes to fight and I guess I do too. I've always been the argumentative type that's why I was so close to Doug for so long. It was a bad idea but I did message Doug. He reminds me not j. He does that joking it a loser shut up cute kind of banter but I'm not too into it.  Our washer went out and I literally haven't washed clothes in a month and I'm probably not really that upset BC it's hard for me to get motivated enough to clean. We're going to get grandpas oldnfridge which is actually kind of exciting to me. I don't really have anything left of him. We're getting a new washer soon too. I'm pretty surprised that we're getting both? It feels like forever since we've had both. My dad's bio dad sent him a hundred today and like get those bandz but I still feel weird about him ESP when he flipped the way he did.

Hopefully this will make it easier to forgive her.

I‚Äôm pissed I have to keep eating gluten and deal with all these symptoms for *months* while I‚Äôm stuck on a stupid waiting list for an endoscopy.

Apparently, if I stop eating gluten, my intestinal damage will heal and it‚Äôll mess up the results.

They need to see the damage for themselves before they can officially tell me to stop eating gluten.

Why are they making me wait to shove a tube up my ass, so they can tell me what I already know?

It‚Äôs fucking stupid.

It‚Äôs not even like I wanna give up gluten. I‚Äôm not excited to stop eating food that tastes good forever.

But it‚Äôs better than fatigue, intense stomach pain, diarrhea, bloating, migraines, weird rashes, mood swings, hives, puking, and all the other symptoms.

Just let me stop, so I can feel better!

But they won‚Äôt.

The doctor told my mom I need one, and my mom always listens to the doctors.

Which means I‚Äôm getting an endoscopy.

So I just have to keep dealing with all this extra pain, even though I *know* what I need to do to fix it.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry about that.

Or maybe this was really about going to my crush‚Äôs house to hang out last night.

It was me and three guys- my crush, who I barely knew, and his two friends, who were total strangers.

Just me and three guys.

Alone.

And they were drinking.

I got so anxious it‚Äôs unbelievable.

I made a complete and total fool of myself.

At one point, my crush lifted his hand to rub his eye, and I fucking *flinched*.

He noticed.

And I kept making weird jokes about spraying RAID in their eyes or killing them or beating them up.

One of them tried to make it less weird by making a joke about hurting me back.

I got so scared, my reflexes took over and I literally grabbed the can of RAID.

They were pretty fucking weirded out by that one.

Who can blame them?

I left after an hour.

I *hate* PTSD!

I thought I was over this shit.

So maybe I‚Äôm angry at myself, for ruining everything.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry that I‚Äôm gonna die alone because I‚Äôm *still* so fucking broken.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry at the world, for making me this way.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry at that.

Or maybe this was really about my mom.

She texted me the other day out of nowhere, just to tell me she loved me and that everything will be ok.

*That* made me *really* mad.

That was the one thing I‚Äôve always wanted to hear.

The one thing she never told me when I needed it.

But that day, I didn‚Äôt need it.

I had a lot going on, but she didn‚Äôt know *any* of it.

And even if she did, I don‚Äôt want that from her.

It‚Äôs too late for it to ever mean anything.

She stole my comfort!

She took the one thing I‚Äôve always wanted, and ruined it forever.

Hearing it from her, with no context, when she doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs wrong, hurt me more than I can say.

Seeing those texts made me cry, in a bad way.

But I couldn‚Äôt even tell her to stop, because she did something nice! And that would be ungrateful.

She took the thing I always tell myself when I need to feel better away from me.

Now, whenever I think those words to myself, I just see her stupid texts.

And it makes me feel worse instead of better.

Maybe I‚Äôm angry about that.

Who knows?

It could be anything.

But it probably wasn‚Äôt really Starbucks.

And I could only yell about their stupid, overpriced coffee and judge-y barista and pretentious hipster customers for so long before even I felt ridiculous.

(It still felt good, though. I regret nothing.)

(Fuck you, Starbucks.)

Eventually, I felt better.

And I was glad I went to Starbucks instead of Tim Horton‚Äôs this morning.

It gave me something safe enough that I could call my mom about when really I needed to talk.

And I‚Äôm grateful that my mom listened to my angry rant about Starbucks.

She didn‚Äôt have to do that.

There was a time when she wouldn‚Äôt have.

But she did, and it made me feel better. And when I got off the phone, I felt lucky that I could call her at all, even if I couldn‚Äôt *really* talk to her.

I‚Äôm starting to accept that there are certain things my mom just can‚Äôt give me.

Maybe my mom is like Starbucks coffee.

It‚Äôs not Tim Horton‚Äôs.

But at least it‚Äôs coffee.

And their coffee isn‚Äôt *that* bad.

Once I calmed down, I took another sip.

And I texted my mom:

*Actually, I kinda like this coffee now*

*I‚Äôve adjusted to the taste*

There‚Äôs a hole in my heart, one that can‚Äôt be filled with coffee- not even Tim Horton‚Äôs.

It makes me sad that I‚Äôll never be able to talk to my mom about anything that matters.

It‚Äôs hard not being able to get any real comfort.

It‚Äôs harder knowing I‚Äôll never be able to.

But this is my reality.

When it comes to the tough stuff, I‚Äôm always gonna be alone. I‚Äôll never have someone I can rely on.

I‚Äôll never get real comfort.

That‚Äôs just the hand I‚Äôve been dealt.

So I just have to deal with it, and move on.

At least I *have* a mom, one who‚Äôs willing to try.

And she did make me feel a little better.

Maybe my mom is like Starbucks.

I just have to get used to the taste."

I feel better about what happened to me today, because what happened to my housemate was so much worse.

Is that fucked up?

I‚Äôm not saying hers was worse in an insecure way.

It was just... so much worse.

Hearing all the details made me sick.

We had a conversation about that today.

It went like this:

She said: ‚ÄúHey, I just... You don‚Äôt feel bad that I reported my rape, right? Cuz, like, you don‚Äôt have to feel guilty about your choice or anything.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúActually, you reporting yours made me feel way better about my choice. Because yours was *so* much worse than mine. *Yours* needs to be reported. Mine doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that! Yours was bad, too.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo, not in a way to put mine down. Just, like, hearing the details of yours yesterday made me feel physically sick. Like, I thought I was gonna throw up.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat happened to me was a bunch of stupid teenagers who took their fun a little too far and forgot that I‚Äôm a person, too. But they weren‚Äôt *malicious*. They were just assholes, and idiots.‚Äù

She started to say something, but I cut her off.

I said: ‚ÄúWhat happened to you was pure evil.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDo you really mean that?‚Äù

I stared her straight in the face.

I said: ‚ÄúI can forgive mine after hearing yours, because at least mine were human beings. What happened to you... only a monster could do something like that.‚Äù

She had this look on her face.

I really hoped I wasn‚Äôt triggering her.

I continued: ‚ÄúThat shit *affected* me, dude. I can‚Äôt even imagine how *you* feel! Like, *I* was maybe-raped and I can‚Äôt even *imagine* what happened to you! Mine was a mistake. Yours was a crime.‚Äù

Her eyes welled with tears.

She said: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine it, either.‚Äù

She took a deep, shaking breath.

Then she said: ‚ÄúThat is *so* validating. Thank you. And I‚Äôm so glad it helped you! I was worried.‚Äù

I said: ‚Äú*You* don‚Äôt have to worry about *me*. *I‚Äôm* fine. Worry about yourself right now, girl.‚Äù

She smiled.

She said: ‚ÄúI feel so much better now.‚Äù

When she said that, I smiled and said: ‚ÄúMe, too.‚Äù"

My mom sometimes likes to tell a funny story from when I was little.

I was 3 or 4 years old.

We were arguing about something.

My mom doesn‚Äôt remember what it was about.

But apparently, something she said just set me off.

I balled up my little-kid fists, stamped my tiny foot, and told her: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a stupid bitch!‚Äù

My mom did not like that at all.

She bent down and stuck her face right in mine.

She screamed: ‚ÄúWhere did you learn that word!‚Äù

This is the part where my mom starts to laugh.

She usually mimics exactly how loud and angry she shouted, how close she got to my face.

Then she mimics me as a toddler, wide-eyed, shrinking back in terror.

My mom can barely contain her laughter as she imitates how small my shaking voice got.

She says I told her, in a voice barely above a whisper: ‚ÄúFrom you, mummy.‚Äù

At this point in the story, my mom can no longer contain herself.

Sometimes, she laughs so hard she has to sit down.

She says: ‚ÄúI forgot I said stuff like that around you! Oh, god, you should have seen the look on your cute little face. You were *terrified!*‚Äù

My mom loves to tell that story.

Apparently, I look pretty funny when I‚Äôm afraid.

One time, when she told me that, I asked her: ‚ÄúSo what did you do after I said I learned it from you?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI sent you to your room, obviously. You were misbehaving.‚Äù"

I feel like they can all hear my breathing
She left the window open again tonight and I had to close it before I sweat to death.
Sweat dripped down my leg on the bus.
I‚Äôve never sweat droplets before.

And I miss F.

I really do.

I saw a picture of him today with a group of people and he looked so happy. I can‚Äôt help but grin.

And when I was in the hospital,
‚ÄúHey ‚Äî‚Äî-. Are you OK? I saw your Instagram post. You‚Äôre in the hospital?! What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

He cares about me. For real.

Some days he‚Äôs the only thing that reminds me that life is worth living. His smile keeps me from just giving up.

I want to make him proud.

But I haven‚Äôt done a SINGLE thing I‚Äôm proud of this past week. I haven‚Äôt made shit.

Linocuts are not fun. I fucked up big time. I wish I‚Äôd been the hospital a day longer. I‚Äôm so behind. I‚Äôll never catch up.

At least me and my photo teacher bonded over our meningitis hospitalizations. That was cool. I‚Äôm pretty sure she knows F. The subject of their art is vaguely similar, yet stylistically different. Plus being local counts.

Regardless, I miss him.

Maybe it‚Äôs weird to miss a teacher.

But he‚Äôs more than a teacher. He‚Äôs a mentor, and just everything I long to be.

And I was the biggest dumbass yesterday.

I had a mini mental breakdown like 5 separate times and I had to go to the bathroom to wipe my tears.

I was cleaning my space which took me half a hour. And I just stared down and could not stop thinking about how much of a failure I was. I just wanted to take the nearest sharp object and just rip my skin apart and die right there.

And I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking like this. Eventually I got it all cleaned and slowly walked back to my space. R saw me and was like are you okay? I was like yeahhh yeah. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I said I was fine and left.

You can‚Äôt just tell acquaintances that you can‚Äôt stop imagining yourself dead or dying. That you hate yourself and am sorry for existing.

Our RA‚Äôs knocked on our door for a bed check. When I opened the door all four of them were doing some damn fortnight dance. I almost died, it was the funniest thing ever.

They‚Äôre really chill. At first I didn‚Äôt love them, but they are actually cool as fuck.

And I‚Äôm back to cursing all the time again. It‚Äôs kind of nice but I hate it. I always wonder if I do it too much.

The girl in the room next to mine cut off her hair because it was her 18th birthday and she could do whatever she wanted. She also bought lotto tickets.

We played cards against humanity for a few hours, then went to the fourth floor rooms where we weren‚Äôt allowed. Stupid rule. One of the girls room was almost fully decorated and had a mini fridge.

For a 3 week camp.

Then we decided to see if the elevator was haunted. We made an Ouija board and sat in a circle in the elevator and traveled up and down to all the floors.

It ended up with some spirit named Moz and is apparently angry with me for taking my finger off. Moz is 100 years old.

I don‚Äôt believe in this shit but it‚Äôs funny as fuck.

I wish I didn‚Äôt hate myself.

I wish I could just be content with my flaws."

I was on my stomach, wedged between the couch and the coffee table.

The wooden leg of the coffee table was less than an inch from my face.

I think I hit my head on the corner of it before I fell.

My head hurt.

I lay there, exhausted, way too drunk.

And I remember hoping they would let me just lie there and rest.

But then the blond one came over.

He said: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

Then the others came, too.

And they lifted me.

And they carried me to the bedroom.

And they dropped me on the bed, face down.

I remember lying there, with my face buried in the blue cotton bedsheets, barely conscious.

And they all stood over me in a circle.

0,"13.07.19. Free time
Some of my friends and I were talking about our childhoods the other day.

My housemate told us about hers.

She said she spent her summers roaming up and down the street with her childhood best friend.

They had total freedom.

Once she spent three days making a giant chalk mural on the driveway.

Another time, she got really into vlogging, and spent all day learning how to edit videos.

She made lots of crafts whenever she was bored.

And each day, her parents would ask her: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing today?‚Äù

And she would tell them.

And her mom would be right inside if any of the kids needed anything.

Otherwise, they could do whatever they wanted.

Sounds made up to me.

She said she didn‚Äôt even do extracurriculars during the school year.

She could join whatever clubs she wanted, but as long as she did her homework and one hour of reading a day, her time was her own.

My jaw dropped when I heard that one.

I guess we had different childhoods.

My school was dual-curriculum with 14 subjects, taught in four languages.

We got out an hour later than the other schools, and then it was off to activities.

I did everything.

Competitive dance, pre-Olympic swimming, gymnastics taught by an ex-Navy SEAL, piano lessons, violin lessons, art classes, tutoring at least 3 times a week (daily during exams), and volunteering.

I was even a child voice actor in fifth grade!

My housemate was making crafts after school when she was ten years old.

At the same age, I was going to work.

When I got home at around 7pm every day, I would watch the kids while my mom made dinner.

Then we‚Äôd eat and put the kids to bed, and the day was over- unless I had homework.

During summers, it was more of the same.

When I was really young, I went to day camps, skill-building workshops, volunteer opportunities, or summer school to fill mine and my parents‚Äô time.

Once I turned seven, I was shipped off to overnight camp until school started again.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I‚Äôm very grateful for all the opportunities I was given.

I‚Äôm lucky that I got to do all that stuff.

But looking back, I realized I‚Äôve never had free time.

I‚Äôve always followed a schedule, set by someone else.

Every second of my life was carefully regimented as I got passed from person to person and place to place.

The only time I was allowed to be alone and do what I wanted was when I locked myself away in my room.

It wasn‚Äôt even like my parents cared what I did.

They never pushed me to win awards or get good grades or try my best or even go to school if I didn‚Äôt feel like it- I skipped most of middle school to spend full days sleeping off depressive spirals in my room.

They never asked me what I was doing.

They never asked me how I was doing.

They never really asked me anything at all.

(Unless they needed something.)

They didn‚Äôt care if I slept through my lessons or got straight A‚Äôs.

They just needed me out of the way.

I‚Äôm really lucky that they filled up my time with camps and lessons and tutors and workshops and jobs.

I‚Äôve had a very interesting life, to say the least.

And I learned a lot doing all that stuff.

I always tried my best.

But... I‚Äôm tired.

And I need a break.

This past year has taken a lot out of me.

I think I‚Äôm gonna take some time off from school."

I was in my friend‚Äôs dorm room, sitting on her bed in the dark late at night.

It was one of those nights where you just talk about everything.

I had never had one of those nights before.

Everything was going great.

My grades were good, I had an active social life, I was independent for the first time, and I was having all sorts of new experiences.

But somewhere in the back of my brain, there was this little niggling feeling.

Deep beneath the surface, there was a pressure.

And it was starting to build.

So, when my friend asked me: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your deepest, darkest secret- something you‚Äôve never told anyone?‚Äù

I told her: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember any of seventh grade.‚Äù

And when I thought about it, I realized there was a lot more I didn‚Äôt remember than just seventh grade.

I told her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm missing chunks of time.‚Äù

And then I remembered something my old AP psych teacher mentioned once, about repressed memories.

And I got this pit in my stomach.

I told her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified of what I might be forgetting.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat could be so bad that I can‚Äôt even think about it?‚Äù

I knew I had a choice to make.

I could learn to live with the uncertainty.

Or I could try to figure out what happened, and learn to live with the consequences.

My friend asked: ‚ÄúDo you wish you knew?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I thought that was the end of it.

But I‚Äôm too curious for my own good.

Without even trying, my memories came back.

I started putting the pieces together.

And my life fell apart."

I want him to force himself inside me.

I want him to make me ask for it.

I want him.

And I want him to want me, too.

I know he likes my personality, because he keeps responding to my texts, and he invited me to hang out with him and his childhood friend this weekend.

But he won‚Äôt like *me* unless I blow his mind in bed.

If I make him wait too long, he could get impatient.

All his testosterone will build up, and he won‚Äôt be able to control himself.

Better for me to take charge, and fuck him right away.

If I don‚Äôt, anything could happen.

He could leave me.

...Or worse.

But if I do, then I win.

He‚Äôll be mine.

I‚Äôll own him.

And he‚Äôll own me, too.

And he‚Äôll keep coming back for more.

And I‚Äôll get to give him what he wants.

I‚Äôll get to *be* what he wants.

And then, it‚Äôll just be a matter of how much I can take, before I feel too gross and get rid of him.

She made me apologize.

I blamed it on the celiac.

Said coming to terms with my diagnosis was making me act out.

He could have done whatever he wanted.

But he didn‚Äôt.

He just got off.

Without even a fight.

He doesn‚Äôt even *want* me!

He just thinks I‚Äôm an easy target because he knows I‚Äôm desperate and easy and no one likes me.

But I bet since I told him ‚Äúno‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt even like me anymore. I‚Äôm not worth the effort.

That‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt responding to me.

My personality‚Äôs not *that* good.

It‚Äôs enough to make him like me.

I didn‚Äôt even have sex with him!

Why did I make him wait??

Now he‚Äôs losing interest!

He‚Äôs just stringing me along, pretending to want someone he can talk to, because there‚Äôs no one here during the summer he can actually fuck.

He‚Äôs just bored.

But he hooked up with *Kate*.

Kate‚Äôs *gorgeous*.

When all the girls like Kate get back to school, he‚Äôll drop me so fast.

Finally, there will be girls he can have sex with.

Girls who aren‚Äôt ugly and broken.

Girls who want sex right away, who don‚Äôt have to wait.

And I‚Äôll have fallen head over heels for him, and then he‚Äôll break my heart like it‚Äôs nothing.

I‚Äôll be an embarrassing story his friends laugh about.

I‚Äôm just some stupid, insecure girl who was desperate enough to believe that someone like him could ever want someone like me.

But he doesn‚Äôt.

Of course he doesn‚Äôt.

And if he did, I scared him off.

Why did I text him back so fast?

I should have waited longer!

But I responded as soon as I saw it.

And now he knows I‚Äôm a desperate loser who wants him, and I came on way too strong, and he doesn‚Äôt want me anymore.

I‚Äôm gonna die alone.

Who could ever want me?

And how could I be stupid enough to think *he* would?

He‚Äôs so much better than that.

i just hate sleeping over.

it makes me feel uncomfortable

vulnerable

i know it‚Äôs just my anxiety talking

or maybe that‚Äôs just how i feel

so why can‚Äôt i stop being a little bitch about it then.

why is it so hard to breathe ?

I managed to get most of my homework done except for one part that i can finish on friday or sunday. tomorrow when i get off of work, im trying to decide either going to walmart or Aldi. Aldi might be better because they are cheap. i wanna buy some real meat to cook food but im too nervous and uncomfortable to do it. it will be tv dinners  then. I should be asleep but the heat prevents that.


A haircut is needed too. i just need the right time for it.

i screenshoted a guy's ass and put it as my screensaver. I know it crazy. i just have an obsession with guy's butt.

 so I got home nice & early yesterday. just before 5pm.
I had made a conscious effort to get home asap so I would have optimum time to masterbanate my weener.
I started my endeavor pretty much as soon as I got in & dropped trou.
I even drank a 5hr. Energy so as I might enhance the experience.

It‚Äôs really been crazy. Miles is my boyfriend now. He is an odd guy but I like it. He makes me feel things I haven‚Äôt in a while. It‚Äôs uncomfortable for me. I‚Äôve only had one previous boyfriend who was a good guy. He tells me I‚Äôm beautiful. I don‚Äôt know how to accept the compliments. I‚Äôm pretty much in like with this guy. I feel really lucky to meet someone like him. He makes me feel so confident and instead of always bringing me down he lifts me up. He respects my personal space. We even take days to ourselves. It‚Äôs so nice to date a man and not a man child.

My daughter has been acting out. Everything is changing. Her dad isn‚Äôt really involved or interested. He came to visit and she has been just an absolute terror to me since. I am trying so hard to be patient and understanding but man...  it‚Äôs killing me inside to see her suffer. I really don‚Äôt know how to help her. I can understand how an absentee dad can leave a huge hole in your heart. I wish I had her with someone who wasn‚Äôt him. I hope I can show her how great it can be without him.

I went back to school today.

But first, my Bubbie came for high tea.

(Sometimes I forget how much my home life resembles an episode of Gossip Girl.)

I‚Äôm glad she came.

We had a really good time together.

We always do.

I told her I want to drop out.

She said: ‚ÄúNo matter what you choose to do, I trust you.‚Äù

I love her.

As per usual with my family, though, things went south after a few hours.

I‚Äôm not sure exactly when it went wrong.

It started with my parents wanting to put my Bubbie in a retirement home.

Somehow, it escalated.

And suddenly everyone was yelling and upset and accusing each other of being abusive.

...But I had a train to catch.

So we all piled in the car and drove me to the station, giving me about 20 minutes to sort everything out.

Perfect.

I did my best, but I couldn‚Äôt completely resolve everything by the time we got to the train.

So I sent my mom a text:

*Hey, I think bubby‚Äôs problem is she feels guilty about  the accusations and is afraid to admit she was an abuser. If you tell her that everyone makes mistakes and we obviously forgive her and still love her no matter what, maybe she‚Äôll apologize. She‚Äôs probably just afraid and yelling at her won‚Äôt help*

*And you can tell her that of course she did the best  she could as a working single mom in a shitty situation, but that doesn‚Äôt mean no one got hurt in the fallout. It doesn‚Äôt have to all be her fault for him to  deserve an apology*

*I doubt she‚Äôd wanna die without getting that closure*

(Ok, I guess I sent her a few texts.)

My mom responded:

*I do recall having that conversation months ago but she refused to listen*

*Well. One would think but truthfully I think she doesn‚Äôt want to die with people thinking she‚Äôs abuser*

I texted back:

*Hmm*

*Maybe I‚Äôll talk to her next time then* ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*You always sound like you‚Äôre yelling even if you‚Äôre not* üòÇ

*maybe you‚Äôre just too loud*

(That was code for: you screamed at her the whole time, and it accomplished nothing. Get out of my way.)

My mom responded:

üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*But she is sooo frustrating*

I said:

*I think your approach skips the step where you take her feelings into consideration*

*You‚Äôre forgetting how hard this must be for her*

*And he accused her while she was scared about the church thing, which wouldn‚Äôt help*

(Last year, my cousin, Bubbie‚Äôs daughter, had a psychotic breakdown and tried to blow up a church.)

I continued:

*And imagine if YOU were an abuser. You‚Äôd feel terrible!*

(That one was hard to type.)

My mom texted back:

*I did al long time ago! This has need for a year!!*

I said:

*Well she clearly still feels that way*

*You can understand her guilt and her pain and THEN guide her to an apology*

*You‚Äôre a social worker! You should know this* üòÇüòÇ

My mom said:

*I think she feels terrible about the accusations*

(Which was... what I said. But whatever.)

I said:

*Exactly*

*So tell her why she doesn‚Äôt have to feel terrible*

*It wasn‚Äôt her fault she was in that situation*

*Everyone makes mistakes*

My mom said:

*Yes. It all makes sense*

I said:

*And then ask her if it really doesn‚Äôt matter or if she‚Äôs just afraid*

*And then tell her she has nothing to be afraid of*

*We all already forgive her*

*And we still love her*

*And once she apologizes, this will all be over*

My mom said:

*You should go into social work*

I told her:

*I‚Äôm not doing this bullshit for the rest of my life, lol*

*I just want her to feel better*

Then the train pulled out of the station, and I lost cell reception for the next few hours.

Luckily, I was occupied.

Our talk had given me a lot to think about.

Somehow, someone else in my life always ends up having the same problems I do.

And it‚Äôs so *easy* to help other people.

I usually find by the time I‚Äôve solved their problem, I‚Äôve solved my own, too.

Even the hard ones.

...Maybe especially those.

I learned a lot about forgiveness today.

I feel better now.

About a lot of things.

And I‚Äôm grateful I got to be a part of this.

They‚Äôve taught me a lot of lessons I might never have learned on my own.

(Maybe because I wouldn‚Äôt have needed to- lol!)

My family‚Äôs crazy, but they‚Äôre mine.

And I‚Äôm lucky for that.

I love them.

And in their own, fucked up way, they make me better.

I had barely stepped off the train when my phone rang, alerting me I had reception again.

It was my sister.

She said: ‚ÄúMummy just called me fat!‚Äù

In the background, I could hear the screams of an argument breaking out.

I sighed.

‚ÄúBeen there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù"
0,"09.07.19. Moving on
It‚Äôs been six months since I tried to kill myself.

It‚Äôs crazy how much better I feel.

For the past few days, I‚Äôve been stressing about the future. Should I drop out? What do I want to do? Etc.

Six months ago, I didn‚Äôt *have* a future.

I literally couldn‚Äôt picture it.

I was so wrapped up in the past; in all that pain.

That was all I could see.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw someone who hurt me.

Those boys.

My mom.

My dad.

My old stalker.

The guy who tried to kill me.

My old teachers.

The doctors at the hospital.

The man without a face, who molested me.

A friend, who took advantage of me.

Another friend, who only tried.

Other boys.

My family.

Dr. Fisher.

My extended family.

More boys.

So, so many boys.

And so many others.

So many hurts.

My brain was like a salad spinner.

All the memories got thrown in together as they flung around my mind in endless circles.

I couldn‚Äôt think.

I couldn‚Äôt see past the pain.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt even distinguish the thoughts anymore. Everything blurred into one big hurt.

And I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

But in the last six months, something changed.

...Me.

I started facing all the things I thought I couldn‚Äôt.

I reached out for help.

I made lots of changes.

I spent countless hours thinking and learning and trying my best to get better.

I remember the first night I felt it.

It was before I started journaling here.

I didn‚Äôt have an outlet for all the shit in my head.

So I opened a word document, and pretended I was an author writing a book.

And I told my whole story.

That was the only time I‚Äôve ever shared the details of what happened that night.

The night that changed everything.

...For better or for worse.

I cried the entire time.

Not nice crying- ugly, heaving, uncontrollable sobs.

When it was over, I saved the file.

Closed it.

Shut my laptop.

Went right to sleep.

And just like that, it was over.

I haven‚Äôt looked at that word document since.

I don‚Äôt even remember what I called it.

I might never open it again.

It served its purpose.

It‚Äôs over now.

Writing let me get the thoughts out of my head.

And once they were gone, they left space for something new.

For the past six months, all I‚Äôve done it write.

And talk, once I learned how.

(I‚Äôm still figuring that one out, though.)

I‚Äôve been cleaning up the mess inside my head.

It‚Äôs not easy.

And it‚Äôs not over- not by a long shot.

But today, I woke up.

And my head was clear.

And I realized how much space I have in there.

Today, when I woke up, I was stressed about the future.

Then I realized: *I‚Äôm stressed about the **future**.*

I‚Äôm not stuck in the past anymore.

Memories don‚Äôt have the same power over me as they used to. Their grip has loosened a little.

Now, I can breathe.

I can think again.

All that work... is working.

The hardest part is over.

I‚Äôm moving on.

I feel better."

I. LOVE. COLLEGE.

Oh my FUCKING god.

This is the best thing that I‚Äôve ever done.

My roommate is super chill and we‚Äôre kind of already friends... maybe??

I was so worried she‚Äôd be a creep or annoying, but she‚Äôs the most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person in the entire camp.

And I don‚Äôt like calling it camp. It‚Äôs basically college.

I go to breakfast at 8, have class until lunch, then some free time, then another class, then a tiny bit of free time before dinner, then class until 10.

It‚Äôs SO FUN. I‚Äôm learning so much. A lot of people think some of the stuff is boring but this is the stuff I LIVE for.

Today was the first normal day with classes. I feel like I‚Äôve been here a week already and it‚Äôs only the second day.

Most of my classes are kind of dull, but my printmaking course is FUCKING AWESOME.

When we walked in for the first time for class today at 6 I almost had a happy anxiety attack.

I could not stop grinning. The space is GORGEOUS. I‚Äôd share a pic but like privacy and shit. There is beautiful lighting and I get MY OWN DESK. My own tiny studio.

My instructor is SO COOL/CHILL.

F knows him and sometimes teaches a class at the college in the same department. I saw a paper racked up to the wall that was totally from one of his workshops.

When I was texting F, he said to tell (printmaking instructor) hi.

You never know if people mean it or not when they say that.

I didn‚Äôt say that to my instructor tonight. I‚Äôm just gonna call him R.

R is so cool. Printmaking is so cool. I think I am in love with it. We sat down and all said our names and shit and why we picked printmaking/ what experience we‚Äôve had.

I dropped some big fancy words like relief printing, silkscreen, intaglio processes. I saw his face kind of give an impressed look.

So that was cool.

We didn‚Äôt do much, but yet we did a lot. I mixed my inks perfectly and applied them better than everyone else. Kept my paper clean. And OH MY GOD. Working in a print studio is SO much more efficient.

I‚Äôm kind of nervous. I really want R to like me. Especially if I‚Äôm going to be going to school here and majoring in printmaking and he being one of my primary teachers.

If I tell him I‚Äôm one of F‚Äôs students, maybe he‚Äôll be nicer. Idk.

But it seems like I already know how to do what we are going to be doing. I can‚Äôt wait until he lets us go to do whatever we want to make.

My goal is to impress his ass and be the best high school printmaker he‚Äôs ever seen.

Anyways. My RA is doing bed checks so I should probably go turn out the light. The RA‚Äôs are chill

0,"08.07.19. High with my sister
My sister and I held hands as we walked through the ravine with my friend after the three of us got high.

We were talking about how little we see each other.

I said: ‚ÄúWe should hang out more.‚Äù

My sister said: ‚ÄúWe should!‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWant to come up and visit me?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYes! When? That sounds great!‚Äù

I turned to my friend with the dopiest grin on my face.

My friend said: ‚ÄúYou guys are cute.‚Äù

My sister smiled and put her head on my shoulder.

I lay my head on top.

And we walked like that, with slightly crooked heads and our hands intertwined, through the darkness."
0,"Okay.
So we broke up. He decided the nice thing to do was just pack up all my shit and throw it in garbage bags. To ""help"" because I guess I am too lazy to do so myself.

He still won't admit to any of his fuck ups. I deserved it all because I wasn't his little maid following him all around the house cleaning up after him. I'm sorry I thought a 29 year old ""man"" could do that himself.

I really like quotations today.

My daughter and I are spending the night at his place again. And all he has done since I've been here is add little jabs to everything. Yes. I know. My fault for putting myself back into a toxic environment I am trying to leave. But I will not keep my daughter from him.

I'm rambling again.

I guess the moral of this is he is a good dad but a super shitty person (to me at least). I can't believe I allowed all this bullshit to go on for so long."
0,"08.07.19. The kids return
My sister and the two youngest kids got back home today.

We were all pretty excited to see each other.

It was nice to have some time with them before I leave again tomorrow.

Once the baby went to bed, the five year old got lots of special attention, since she was the only kid here.

She *loved* it.

And I loved getting to give it to her.

But like always, I noticed some stuff happening that made me worried.

Like, when my dad walked in the door.

She looked at me, eyes wide, and whispered: ‚ÄúWe have to hide!‚Äù

Then she ran off to hide in the corner, sucking her thumb as she sat silently.

It gave me a pit in my stomach.

...Especially since she‚Äôs the kid who has a lot of the same symptoms I had at that age.

And something bad happened to me at that age.

Then my aunt walked in to talk to my mom.

The five year old burst out with a big grin and said: ‚ÄúHi mom!‚Äù

No response.

She tried again: ‚ÄúHi mom!‚Äù

Nothing.

She said: ‚ÄúMom!‚Äù

That got my aunt‚Äôs attention.

She looked her daughter right in the eyes.

Didn‚Äôt react in the slightest.

Then she turned back to my mom and kept talking.

The five year old‚Äôs shoulders slumped.

I tried to give her a hug, but she didn‚Äôt want one.

...Or at least, not from me.

Then all the adults left for dinner.

The five year old said: ‚ÄúBut you went out last night! Can‚Äôt you stay here with me?‚Äù

My uncle told her: ‚ÄúSometimes grownups like time alone. Stop whining, and be good for your cousins.‚Äù

Then they left.

And my sister, my cousin and I were alone.

We had a good time.

She‚Äôs a really cute kid.

I taught her how to play guitar.

She said I could write her a song if I wanted.

(I‚Äôm working on it now.)

And my sister is joining me later to get high with my friends, which will be fun.

But, it just makes me sad sometimes.

I wish I could protect them forever.

But I can‚Äôt."
0,"08.07.19. Those high talks
Last night, my friend and I went to a weed caf√©.

We bought edibles and some fancy dispensary bud.

The we got some regular ice cream bars from the corner store across the street, and found a quiet place to sit and smoke under the stars.

We sat on the steps outside a high school.

It was a specialized art high school, so there were all these gorgeous strips of glowing light that changed colours built into all the concrete structures.

(Those were *awesome* once we were high.)

Then we just stayed there, and talked.

My friend told me her parents love me, and don‚Äôt mind having me over all the time.

That was really nice to hear.

I figured I‚Äôd overstated my welcome- last summer, I spent almost every night on their couch.

But it turns out, they like having me around.

We talked about lots of other things, too.

She told me all about how miserable she is in her program. How little she has figured out.

(There was more, but I won‚Äôt write about it here. It‚Äôs not my place to publicize her story.)

I told her about how unmotivated I‚Äôve been, too.

How I was passionate and excited about coding, but my degree has turned into mostly math.

I told her how much I fucking hate math.

She said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking all night about your old job at that charity place. Your face lights up when you mention volunteering at the cat shelter.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with non-profit work... other than the lifestyle! Haha.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. And if it was just for me, I don‚Äôt really care about money. But my dad...‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYour dad cares about how much money you‚Äôll make?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs the thing. He doesn‚Äôt, and neither of my parents have ever expected me to be successful the way they are. So... that‚Äôs it? I don‚Äôt want them to be right. I don‚Äôt want to be the failure they think I am.‚Äù

She raised her eyebrows.

She said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone is ever going to be as successful as your dad.‚Äù

I had never thought about that before.

She said: ‚ÄúNo one expects you to be the CEO of an international, multi-billion dollar company.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs million.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúGod, who gives a shit? You‚Äôre not a failure if you don‚Äôt end up a multi-billion or million-aire.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI kind of am, though. Usually, kids in my place don‚Äôt go to school. They just work for their dads and eventually take over the family business. If I did that, I would be successful, too.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThen do that.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to do that! I already turned my dad down. Now he‚Äôs trying to snag my brother.‚Äù

She giggled, exhaling smoke through her nose.

She said: ‚ÄúYour life is ridiculous.‚Äù

I giggled, too.

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with following your passion, even if it‚Äôs riskier. And it‚Äôs not a bad thing that you want to build your own future instead of just abusing your privilege forever.‚Äù

I took a harsh hit, and coughed.

When I could breathe again, I said: ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre kind of blowing my mind right now.‚Äù

She laughed.

She said: ‚ÄúYeah, dude, you don‚Äôt have to want lots of money. It‚Äôs ok to want to help people.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúBlech. Is that really all I am - nice? I don‚Äôt want the only thing I‚Äôm good for to be putting others before myself! What a stupid job.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúOh nooo, being *nice*. Devoting your life to helping others- gross! What a horrible way to live.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúIt *is* a horrible way to live! And at family reunions everyone else will be staring down at me from their mansions that they bought with their good, selfish, high-paying jobs while I roll up from my one-bedroom studio apartment that I share with six cats!‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be a good person.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a poor person.‚Äù

She took a puff from the pipe.

On the exhale, she said: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll love it.‚Äù

As she spoke, the smoke curled out her mouth, the pale tendrils contrasting against the darkness.

She said: ‚ÄúAnd at the end of the day, when you get back to your rundown studio apartment to feed your six cats, you‚Äôll be satisfied.‚Äù

I watched the smoke drift up towards the stars, her words blowing away with the wind.

She said: ‚ÄúYou might be broke, but...‚Äù

She paused to take a hit.

She breathed it in, leaned back, and gave a long exhale, a thick cloud flying out her mouth into the air.

Then she turned back to me.

‚Äú...You‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù"
0,"07.07.19. Holy shit, I met a boy
It was an accident, I swear.

This was never supposed to happen.

My housemate has a crush on a different boy, a boy who likes her back.

So she planned a ‚Äúgroup date‚Äù.

It was really just an excuse for the two of them to go on a date without having to admit that‚Äôs what they wanted or be alone together.

I didn‚Äôt want to go.

But she really wanted me there, so we came to a compromise.

We would invite this guy - the least likely kind of guy to like me like that - to be my date.

He‚Äôs the kind of guy that has a reputation.

I‚Äôm the kind of girl that doesn‚Äôt.

So I agreed to go.

Why wouldn‚Äôt I?

I had nothing to worry about. I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be interested in me.

And our town gets pretty boring in the summer.

My housemate wasn‚Äôt even being serious when she suggested him. But it was just ridiculous enough to work.

We thought it would make for a funny story in case things didn‚Äôt work out between her and her date.

I couldn‚Äôt even ask him myself- I didn‚Äôt have his contact info.

My housemate had to ask if he‚Äôd be willing to tag along as my date for one night.

He said sure.

Why wouldn‚Äôt he?

He had nothing to worry about. He knew I wouldn‚Äôt be interested in him.

And our town gets pretty boring in the summer.

He probably thought it would make for a funny story to tell at work.

My housemate promised: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt leave you alone with him. You‚Äôll be safe.‚Äù

But I was still nervous.

I made it very clear I had no interest in him.

When he got there, he asked me and my housemate: ‚ÄúSo... is this a real date?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

My housemate said: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

(Her date was standing nearby.)

I said: ‚Äú*No.*‚Äù

She said: ‚Äú*Yes!*‚Äù

My date said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused.‚Äù

I motioned at my housemate and her date, and told him: ‚ÄúThis whole thing is an excuse for these two to get together. We‚Äôre NPCs. So... grab a balloon.‚Äù

(The first part of the date was a water balloon fight.)

He said: ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre just wingmen?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúPretty much.‚Äù

And I popped a water balloon right in his face.

He said: ‚ÄúHey! I thought we‚Äôre supposed to be on the same team!‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

And I popped another one.

The look on his dripping wet face was priceless.

But after that, I got the message.

I figured if he was nice enough to accompany me, I should be nice enough to make sure we both had a half-decent time.

I am a bit of a pessimist- I knew I should at least *try* to go in with a good attitude.

What was the point of going if not to have fun?

So I said: ‚ÄúTruce?‚Äù

And he shook my hand.

Then we tag-teamed my housemate, pounding her with water balloons from every direction... except the one leading directly to her date, of course.

It ended up being a lot of fun.

Turns out, we have the same sense of humour.

At some point, one of our jokes turned into fake-flirting with each other, since we were fake-dates.

We thought it was funny, and it kept us entertained.

But then my housemate and I went off by ourselves to ‚Äúget something‚Äù and debrief.

I told her: ‚ÄúI have a pit in my stomach.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThen stop flirting with him!‚Äù

And I realized that somehow, our fun little joke had stopped being a joke.

We were flirting for real.

But I knew he was just toying with me, so it didn‚Äôt stress me out as much as I thought it would.

It wasn‚Äôt like he really wanted to do anything with me.

He was just bored because he was on this stupid group date with us and had nothing else to do.

Plus, it was fun.

I haven‚Äôt flirted in forever.

Especially not with someone like him.

And up close, he‚Äôs a lot nicer than his reputation gives him credit for.

So when we wanted to get high, and no one else in the group wanted to come, I didn‚Äôt think twice about going off alone with him.

We were only supposed to stay out in my backyard for a few minutes to smoke, then go right back in with the group.

But we stayed out so long, the others made dinner without us, and had to send someone out to get us.

We said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right in.‚Äù

But then we forgot, and just kept talking.

Eventually, the group gave in, and brought a table and folding chairs out to the backyard.

And we all ate together, under the stars.

But then the weed wore off.

So him and I went off on our own again, to the front yard this time.

But then he got too high, and needed a few minutes alone before he could socialize with everyone again.

And just like that, we were alone in my room.

He sat in the chair, and I sat on the bed.

There was lots of space between us.

We just talked.

He told me he doesn‚Äôt do hookups anymore, that he‚Äôs taking time to work on himself.

I told him I‚Äôm doing the same.

He asked me why, and I told him about the sketchy situation I got in last year, and how it gave me anxiety.

He took it better than I would have expected from a guy like him.

We called it ‚Äúmy tragic backstory‚Äù.

Then my friend came in to grab something.

(Later, she told me it was actually just to check on my safety, because of his history. She‚Äôs the best! <3)

On her way out, she left the door open.

(In hindsight, probably on purpose.)

So he got out of the chair and closed it.

Something about wanting to keep the fan air in the room, instead of blowing out.

...Like I was gonna believe that.

When he came back, he sat on the bed.

Right next to me.

My heart started beating, in a good way.

Our arms were touching, and we would playfully lean up against each other as we talked.

I added him on Snapchat.

He sent me a picture.

I sent him one back- an ugly one that I caught of him, really zoomed in. I drew a pedo-stache on it.

As I giggled, he looked over and saw it.

He said: ‚ÄúOh, no way!‚Äù

Then he pounced, wrestling to get the phone out of my hand.

And I started to understand his reputation a bit more.

He was strong, and he didn‚Äôt hold back.

He pinned me to the bed, hard.

Then he straddled me.

He leaned in.

I could feel his whole weight on top of me.

He had one of my arms held over my head.

My heart was beating- not in a good way.

Suddenly, I was reminded of another time I was pinned to the bed.

I could feel a different boy‚Äôs hand pressed against my wrist, holding me down.

My mind went blank. I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I said: ‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù

The smile left his face, but he did.

And we sat up, and I muttered: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hook up. Sorry. I just... sorry.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt- I was just playing around, I didn‚Äôt- uh, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean to completely ruin this relation- uh, friendship. We should still hang out!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ruin anything.‚Äù

Then, we stayed and talked some more.

...It was more awkward this time.

And there was less touching.

But he said: ‚ÄúWe should definitely still hang out again. I‚Äôd be cool as friends or something more.‚Äù

And I said: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we start off as friends and see what happens?‚Äù

He said that sounded good.

Five minutes after he left my house, he sent me a Snapchat, and we immediately started flirting.

We‚Äôve been Snapchatting all weekend.

We have plans to go the gym together when I get back from home.

How did this happen?

He‚Äôs *dangerous*.

Not in a hot, clich√© way.

(Well, kind of exactly in that way.)

My friend asked me what his reputation is, and all I knew to say is: ‚ÄúHe hits women.‚Äù

We have a lot in common. He‚Äôs been in sketchy situations before, too, just like me.

...But he‚Äôs usually on the other end of them.

But he said he‚Äôs trying to change.

And when someone offered wine, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drinking tonight.‚Äù

(He only gets violent when he‚Äôs drunk.)

And he got off me when I told him to.

He even said it was fine that I didn‚Äôt wanna hook up.

He‚Äôs still talking to me even though I didn‚Äôt do anything with him.

(...But did that just make him want me more?)

My friends told me to go for it... but to stay in public.

I can‚Äôt believe I like a guy who I can‚Äôt even be left alone with.

I can‚Äôt *believe* I fell for the one guy I thought I could never, ever fall for.

But rumours aren‚Äôt always true.

He didn‚Äôt give me any reason to believe he‚Äôll hurt me, and I‚Äôm literally always looking for them.

It seems unfair to not even give him a chance.

I‚Äôm still nervous, obviously.

I don‚Äôt know what he wants from me, or what he‚Äôs capable of.

But we had a really good time together.

He got off me when I told him to.

And he‚Äôs *cute*.

(I haven‚Äôt been able to feel attracted to anyone for a while. I wasn‚Äôt even attracted to him, at first.)

When I think of him, I start grinning like a schoolgirl.

And I haven‚Äôt stopped smiling all weekend.

I can‚Äôt get him off my mind.

I *hate* that I like him.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt.

...But I do."

Something weird is going on.

...I think my parents might love me.

I went home this weekend, because my mom was worried about me and wanted to take care of me.

(Weird.)

All the kids are away at summer camp, except my sister, who‚Äôs staying at her boyfriend‚Äôs, and the two youngest ones, who are up north with their parents.

So I‚Äôm the only one home.

It‚Äôs just me and my parents.

(Weird.)

They spent all day paying attention to me.

(...Weirder.)

My dad even took me to the mall for a shopping spree. He said I could spend as much as I want as long as everything was in my size.

(That one‚Äôs actually not weird. My dad always shows how much he loves me with money and presents.)

Usually, I size up two or three sizes, or just buy men‚Äôs clothing. But my dad said I have a good figure and I should show it off more.

(Weird.)

That made me a little uncomfortable, since I don‚Äôt like to be too exposed. But he was nice about it, and didn‚Äôt make me buy anything too revealing.

(...Weird.)

My mom wanted to come, too, but my dad didn‚Äôt let her. He told her: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll make it all about you.‚Äù

My mom agreed, and decided not to come.

(,..Weirder.)

Apparently, today was supposed to be all about me.

(*...Weird!!*)

So I bought a whole bunch of new, well-fitting clothes.

My dad and I even got lunch together.

We spent an hour just talking, catching up and getting to know each other.

(...Weird.)

Turns out, I like my dad.

(Weirder!)

When we got home, we showed all the clothes to my mom. We spent an hour in my room just hanging out and looking at my clothes.

(Weird!)

Both of them kept telling me I looked good.

(Weird!! What the fuck?)

They gave me lots of hugs.

(Weird.)

My dad didn‚Äôt even touch my back! He almost did a few times- but stopped when I flinched. Every time!

(WEIRD.)

Then we ate dinner together.

(Weird.)

Just the three of us.

(Weirder.)

I did most of the talking.

(WEIRDER.)

It was... really nice.

(WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.)

Later, my mom wants to watch TV with me, since she missed out on spending time with me today.

(Weird!!!)

And then I‚Äôm going out to get high with my friends.

(That one‚Äôs not weird. I‚Äôm just excited.)

My parents were so nice to me, all day.

There were no kids around to take care of or worry about or get in the way of my plans.

Nobody tried to hurt me or make me do anything I didn‚Äôt want to or touch me when I said no.

They just listened to me, and paid attention to me, and acted like they cared about me.

It was weird.

But, good weird.

I feel... loved.

(Weird.)

...By my *parents*.

(WEIRD.)

Is this what my whole life could have been like?

(Fuck- talk about weird.)

I know better than to get used to this.

I know how quickly things can fall apart.

And the kids won‚Äôt be gone forever.

Everything will be back to normal soon.

But they‚Äôre trying, and that means a lot.

I‚Äôm not going to forget my parents‚Äô kindness, or take their effort for granted.

I had a really nice day.

...At *home*.

0,"5:27 PM 7/6/19
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been so lazy in writing.

The last three days have been 50% sleeping, and 50% trying not to fall asleep from heat exhaustion.

I still feel like I‚Äôm not awake. But I‚Äôve got three more hours in the car until I get home. Thought I‚Äôd update my diary a bit.

I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to my great grandma. I feel so guilty. I told my dad we did so we didn‚Äôt have to turn around.

I can‚Äôt imagine being 93. She still walks around her little ‚Äúhouse‚Äù just fine. She hates using her walker but she will when she goes out. She‚Äôs a bit hard on hearing but she still talks up a storm.

I helped her with a computer thing. She couldn‚Äôt figure out how to close out tabs. When I showed her she looked at me like I was a hero.

I hope this wasn‚Äôt the last time I‚Äôll ever see her.

I‚Äôve been listening to the Black Keys new album ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Rock‚Äù on repeat this weekend. I LOVE it. I don‚Äôt know if I love it because it‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs not my favorite of their albums, but I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre back together after 5 years.

I watched a YouTube video months ago that said they had disbanded with little hope for new music.

It‚Äôs not as hardcore as I expected but I kind of like it. It‚Äôs kind of peaceful.

Anyways I spent the last three days at our families little town in the middle of nowhere. It‚Äôs not OUR town, but my grandpa grew up there and so did his parents and their parents moved there I think. My dad spent time in the summer there as a kid.

It was nice to spend time with my second cousins and their dad. They‚Äôre a lot friendlier than I remembered. The kids aren‚Äôt as hyper as I remembered. It‚Äôs kind of sad because I see myself becoming more boring as the years go on too.

Today before they left I got his number, and his wife and the oldest boy. Hopefully we will spend more time together in the future. It‚Äôs nice knowing I‚Äôve got other kids in the family.

My grandparents weren‚Äôt as annoying as I expected. They were a bit but it was okay.

They made me draw a picture of an old photo of a tire shop that belonged to someone in our family a while back. It sold at the fundraising auction today for $125. I can‚Äôt believe it. I wish everything I spent time on could make $125.

Sadly I don‚Äôt get to keep any of the money. Not even to reimburse me for the frame. Oh well. Guess that was my contribution.

The sun is beating down on the back of my head. My flat hair is hot. I hope I don‚Äôt get sunburnt.

There are so many cows. It seems like every time I look out the window there is a beard of cows. The plains out here are pretty flat. No y‚Äôall trees. Fields of wheat and corn. The corn hasn‚Äôt been doing good this year because of the rain.

As we drive east the land gradually gets a little less flat and some more trees. Less cows too.

While driving around town yesterday we drove by a huge cattle farm with over 70,000 cows. It was literally cows as far as you could see. Big rectangle dogs.

Cows are hilarious.

We‚Äôre not supposed to get back home until 9:00 ish.

I‚Äôll have to shower, and do my skin routine because my skin has just soaked in bug spray, sweat, and dirt all weekend. Fix my nails. Spray my sandals clean from the dust and mud that‚Äôs caked in the crevices.

I have to finish packing. I leave tomorrow morning for my art camp. I seriously can‚Äôt wait to be gone for three weeks.

AND OH MY GOD.

I rarely think about F. I‚Äôm glad my obsession wasn‚Äôt too bad. But I messaged him out of the blue yesterday because I wanted to see if there were any updates on the Santa Fe trip.

I‚Äôm really worried it‚Äôs not going to happen at all, or at least in October. Anyways. I also mentioned if he wanted the details for the exhibition at the end of the camp.

‚ÄúOf course! I‚Äôd love to come to the show. Please let me know. Have fun!! And say hi to (art professor) for me.‚Äù

I said ‚ÄúI sure will. He‚Äôll probably be there on the exhibition night too‚Äù

Then he said ‚ÄúYeah I will really try to go. I want to see what you make!‚Äù

Then I jokingly said ‚ÄúThe pressure is on haha‚Äù

To which he replied, ‚ÄúNah. No pressure! Just do your thing, don‚Äôt compare yourself to anyone else, have fun and soak up as much as you can. F. U. N. is the word. It‚Äôll be awesome!‚Äù

I hope he didn‚Äôt think I was being too serious although I do feel a lot of pressure.

But the biggest pressure is to do good in front of the college. I need to make a good impression so I can get better scholarships.

Oh my god I‚Äôm so excited. He said he actually wants to go and is excited to see what I make. He is too good to me. I don‚Äôt know where I would be without his support. ‚Äî certainly not going to the camp in the first place.

I can‚Äôt wait to see him on the 26th. A whole 20 days away.

I need to text him and tell him more details regarding the date and time and place of the exhibition. I figure I‚Äôll wait till I‚Äôve gotten to campus.

I am SO excited aaaaaaah.

The land is so beautiful out here. Overall it looks kind of bland but the beautiful mixtures of wildflowers and tallgrass is breathtaking. You can see forever and the sky is so vast.

0,"06.07.19. Not what it sounds like
Right when I got back the next morning, I got a text from one of my friends wondering where I was.

I was late to help clean the dorm room we had trashed the night before. They told me to get my butt over there ASAP.

When I got there, they asked me where I had gone after I left them last night.

Laughing, I told the details I remembered.

I wondered if they would be proud of me, for getting so much action. At the very least, I hoped I had enough details to make for an interesting story.

But no one laughed.

Everyone just kind of looked at me.

Then one of them said: ‚ÄúThat sounds like gang rape.‚Äù

And another said: ‚ÄúYeah, are you ok?‚Äù

I scoffed.

I said: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt *rape*, guys. Don‚Äôt be dramatic.‚Äù

And we never talked about it again.

But when I went back to my room later, I thought about what my friend said.

And I remember feeling so relieved.

I thought: *Thank god. That one was finally bad enough- I can stop now.*

How can it be rape if I felt relieved after?

It wasn‚Äôt gang rape.

It was just an excuse for me to stop having sex.

But it wasn‚Äôt *rape.*

I was just tired of getting hurt all the time.

But I was lying.

It wasn‚Äôt really rape."

Ever since me and the girl broke up, I‚Äôve needed to recharge my emotions and get back into a good path. Had a 4 day, got invited to Croatia and denied it. Friday night a friend came over we smoked some hookah we had good laughs and ended up cuddling in bed. I didn‚Äôt take it any farther because I knew what I was doing. I was just trying to distract myself and get the ex outta my head. Got invited to Milan today and I also denied it. Making a stupid excuse. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to be social right now. It takes a lot keeping a fake smile on my face. I‚Äôve been watching friends all weekend and it makes me laugh but after a couple moments I go back to my sad little hole. This is really the only place I come to, to express how I truly feel. I don‚Äôt want any of my friends back home thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with me. There is but I don‚Äôt wanna worry them. 10 more days until I go back home. Best friends wife is having a bbq. Which doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea until you realize her bff is my ex girlfriend. So bbq should be awkward. I won‚Äôt drink because I know how I get when I do. I know it‚Äôs gonna hurt seeing her again. In the back of my mind tho, there‚Äôs this stupid hope that we might talk things out and work on us. But I know from prior experiences that that‚Äôs not how it works. Just hopeless hope.
Going back to friends now. Hope y‚Äôall had a good weekend!"

I‚Äôm so annoyed with Greg. I never get annoyed with him. We talked about it because we really do have great communication but I‚Äôm still mad. I‚Äôm almost wondering if cigarettes are contributing to my poor attitude about the situation or if i actually feel this way. I‚Äôm so hurt. He constantly has to nap and it‚Äôs because he literally just wants to. But you know I get that. We have the same mental illness‚Äô and I get that you have to have a depression nap sometimes I do too.

I got interested in all the things you are, you even showed interest in things I really like recently but I‚Äôm still hurting so bad. So what? Am I just depressed?

Ok, so I *do* have PTSD.

But I don‚Äôt think I was gang raped.

*Something* happened.

I didn‚Äôt try to kill myself for fun.

I did it because I was sent into a depressive spiral after what happened.

But... what happened?

I‚Äôm not comfortable saying I was raped.

That feels like lying.

Really, I don‚Äôt know what happened.

I don‚Äôt remember most of it.

But I‚Äôm missing chunks of time from all throughout my life. And I‚Äôm missing chunks of time from that night, too.

The internet said that‚Äôs a symptom of repressed memories.

Repressed memories are a sign that something bad happened.

But... what happened?

I‚Äôve always said it was gang rape, like I was so sure.

But that was just me covering up my insecurity.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt know what really happened.

And that scares the shit out of me.

Because what if I said yes and I just don‚Äôt remember?

What if I liked it?

And if I don‚Äôt even remember it, why did it affect me so much? I shouldn‚Äôt have PTSD from something I don‚Äôt even know really happened.

If I‚Äôm gonna be this messed up from it, I figured I might as well act like it really did happen.

But it didn‚Äôt.

*Something* happened.

But probably not something that counts as gang rape.

Am I a bad person for lying?

This all started because of something I heard on a podcast.

I really need to stop listening to stupid fucking podcasts until I get all my shit worked out.

There was a girl on this podcast who lied about being gang raped as an adult because she was molested as a kid and didn‚Äôt know how to deal with it.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I did, too.

Maybe I exaggerated what happened on St. Patty‚Äôs to seem worse than it really was, because I had never told anyone about what happened when I was little.

And I finally had a way to get my feelings out, and to get the help I needed.

I lied when I said I‚Äôve never been raped.

I have.

But I also lied when I said I was gang raped.

It was just one person who used those words to describe it, when I told him the details I remembered from that night.

And I let his words get in my head and shape my opinions and feelings of what happened.

But it makes me feel like a liar to say it.

I *was* raped.

But the real story is too hard to talk about.

It‚Äôs too hard to even *think* about.

And I wonder how much of what I felt towards the ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù really had to do with what actually happened that night.

It‚Äôs not like I reported it or told anyone other than a few close friends about what happened.

But I wonder if maybe those boys got the brunt of some strong feelings that maybe they didn‚Äôt deserve.

It might have just been group sex I couldn‚Äôt handle.

And I‚Äôm sorry I called it rape before I was certain.

Because I‚Äôm not certain.

I‚Äôm not certain about anything.

Some days I feel like everything is real.

But some days, I feel like I made everything up.

My entire life feels pretend.

So much shit has happened.

How can it all be real?

It can‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs too much.

And I think what happened just pushed me over the edge, and that‚Äôs why I broke.

But it wasn‚Äôt *really* gang rape.

I just can‚Äôt believe I got PTSD from a lie."

It didn‚Äôt happen.

How can I?

I‚Äôve never really experienced rape.

Well, I guess I was molested.

...Unless I just made that up, too.

And even then, being molested isn‚Äôt like being raped.

And making it all up *definitely* isn‚Äôt like being raped.

I can‚Äôt imagine what being raped is really like.

I don‚Äôt have any memories of it happening.

I‚Äôm just a selfish, privileged, spoiled, sheltered piece of shit who made stuff up for attention and excuses.

I‚Äôve had it easy.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really like to be broken.

I haven‚Äôt suffered the way a real survivor has.

How *dare* I say that happened to me?

What the *fuck* is wrong with me?

Yes, I tried to kill myself.

Yes, I cut for months.

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for a year.

Yes, I was dependent on drugs.

Yes, I engaged in reckless behaviour.

Yes, I put myself in dangerous situations.

Yes, I felt too unsafe to leave the house.

Yes, I had nightmares.

Yes, I felt pretend.

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

Yes, I had panic attacks.

(But they weren‚Äôt *bad* panic attacks. Nothing like the one my housemate had.)

Yes, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying.

Yes, I isolated myself from friends and family.

Yes, I was afraid of men.

...I was afraid of everyone.

Yes, I didn‚Äôt feel safe- no matter where I went.

Yes, I stopped going out.

Yes, I was afraid of groups.

Yes, I can‚Äôt get turned on anymore.

Yes, sex makes me feel disgusting.

Yes, I don‚Äôt like people touching me anymore.

(Especially my back.)

But that was all just regular anxiety.

I wasn‚Äôt *raped*.

...But I don‚Äôt have an anxiety disorder.

The testing lady said so.

Could it all be just regular depression?

I thought it was caused by undiagnosed ADHD- that would explain the impulsive behaviour and why I couldn‚Äôt focus and my strong emotions.

...But I don‚Äôt have ADHD.

Can depression explain all that, too?

It probably can.

I probably just have regular depression.

The part that doesn‚Äôt make sense is that I have all the symptoms of PTSD.

So what caused all those symptoms?

I read PTSD can be caused by false memories in rare cases. Is that what happened to me?

...No, that can‚Äôt be it, either.

Because false memories feel real, and this feels fake.

It *is* fake.

I made it up.

I don‚Äôt have PTSD.

How can I?

There‚Äôs a lava lamp in my room.

It‚Äôs almost always on. At night, it illuminates everything with its bright blue glow.

Light bugs my eyes when I‚Äôm trying to sleep.

So tonight, I walked over to the lava lamp.

Fumbled for the power box on its cord.

Turned the little wheel ‚Äòtil it clicked.

And my room went dark.

For a second, I just stood there, in total darkness.

Then I clicked the wheel again, and my room lit up with that familiar, brilliant blue.

I was busy pitying myself when my housemate came into my room, just curious how I was handling the heat.

(Not well.)

Even though he just had one question, he ended up staying for half an hour, just rambling on about anime.

He‚Äôs nice to listen to.

Sometimes, he just goes on these extended rants about anime I haven‚Äôt seen, or video games I haven‚Äôt played, or anything about Dungeons and Dragons.

(I just don‚Äôt like Dungeons and Dragons. No hate, it‚Äôs just not for me.)

But even though all I can do during his rambles is smile and nod along, I still like hearing them.

Once he realized I‚Äôm actually listening, he lets his excitement get the better of him.

He just comes alive.

He could talk about all that stuff forever if I only had the attention span.

I asked him if he wanted to watch anime with me downstairs where it‚Äôs air conditioned, even though we didn‚Äôt have plans to watch TV together today.

So he made popcorn and I grabbed a bowl of raspberries and my unicorn pillow, and we settled in on the couch.

We watched for hours.

By the time we were finished, I felt way better.

Like, even my leg hurts less.

He brought me back, and he didn‚Äôt even try.

He didn‚Äôt even know!

We don‚Äôt talk about stuff like that, which I prefer.

This was just a good time, simple as that.

When we were finished, my other housemate came downstairs and sat with us, too.

She went on her phone, and the other opened his laptop, and I lay down on the couch to rest.

And I realized my head didn‚Äôt feel so foggy anymore.

The horrible feeling that I thought was unfixable had lifted. I felt way better than I did only a few hours ago.

With my eyes closed, I listened as we each got lost in our own little worlds, sitting around the coffee table.

And I thought: *This is how it should be.*

All of us together.

It‚Äôs easier to lose yourself when you know someone will be there to find you.

With them around, I can let go a little.

They keep me here.

They ground me."
0,"04.07.19. Sick day
I‚Äôm tired.

I was up until 3am last night.

Couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I got high- which triggered one of the worst anxiety attacks I‚Äôve ever had.

I walked all the way to the hospital before I realized what a bad idea that was, and went back home.

I literally thought I was going to die.

For hours, I stayed up, panicking on and off.

There was just this feeling that if I went to sleep, I would never wake back up again.

Going to sleep felt like deciding to die.

But then, I stopped caring.

And I almost slept right through my blood test today.

This one was worse than last time.

One of my veins blew out because it was still fragile from the last needle.

Then the nurse flipped me upside down with no warning so I wouldn‚Äôt pass out.

I freaked out and made her put me back up.

Then I got a whole battery of needles.

I needed lots of tests.

There‚Äôs a lot wrong with me.

By the time it was over, I was drained- literally. (Lol!)

I was calmer this time, but I think it‚Äôs just because I was too woozy and tired to fight back.

Then I had to walk back home with those stupid cotton bandaids on both arms.

She said I had to keep them on for 15 minutes.

*So* embarrassing.

Everyone could see I needed tests in both arms!

I bet they could tell how pathetic I was.

I wish I didn‚Äôt need stupid bandaids.

We stopped at Tim Horton‚Äôs so I could get an ice coffee and some food before I passed out.

I wonder if anyone thought I was wearing the bandaids for attention.

The guy I rejected yesterday found something on the internet about how I used to self harm for attention.

He also dug up some other stuff about me, like how I got an impulse tattoo.

He sent me a text about it calling me an idiot.

Then he told me to ‚Äúget fukked‚Äù.

What a dumbass.

He was probably just hurting.

But I wish he hadn‚Äôt violated my privacy like that.

Not that anything he did was out of character.

I should have known better than to give him enough information to find that stuff in the first place. It just didn‚Äôt even occur to me that he would look.

God, he‚Äôs such a nuisance.

I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over now.

...I hope.

I bought my housemate a donut for coming with me to the doctor.

She said it was nothing, and to stop thanking her.

I‚Äôm so grateful she puts up with me.

We saw a dog outside the coffee place, which was fun. We got to pet it.

It was so cute!

Then we went home and I collapsed on the couch with my unicorn pillow.

My stomach hurts from cramps.

My head hurts from the heat.

My arm hurts from my stupid vein collapsing.

Even my leg hurts, from my injury flaring up a few days ago. Ugh. Sometimes I wish I could just cut it off.

I took Advil but it didn‚Äôt help.

I hate being like this.

I feel broken.

And useless.

Stupid fucking blood test.

I *hate* the doctor!"
0,"03.07.19. Just a normal diary entry
Man, I had a full day today!

I had four online quizzes due that I forgot about, so the first two hours of my day were rough while I did those.

Then, I rejected someone.

(That‚Äôs a story that deserves its own post. It‚Äôs still too complicated for me to put into words what happened yet, but when it‚Äôs completely over I‚Äôll be able to put the story together- and behind me.)

My housemate and I ordered fast food for lunch and ate it on my bedroom floor while we had an extensive talk about rape and mental illness.

I‚Äôm so grateful to have someone like her, who I can talk to about all this shit. It really helps.

I finally did my laundry!

I‚Äôve been putting it off for an obscene amount of time. I literally didn‚Äôt have a single shirt left in my closet.

Putting on a fresh t-shirt straight out of the dryer is the one of the best feelings ever.

Then I went to my math tutor‚Äôs house, since him and his wife invited me over for dinner again.

It was so much fun!

We ordered sushi and smoked a few bowls out on their plant-covered balcony and watched anime and played with their cat.

His wife even made raspberry cheesecake!

...From scratch!!

They‚Äôre such good, interesting people.

(Not because of the cheesecake. But that, too!)

I hope they invite me over again- I really enjoy their company. I hope they like mine, too.

I can never tell if people want me around or if they want me gone, especially when I like them.

But I hope I was a good guest.

(Or at least a neutral one- I don‚Äôt want to be rude!)

They were really good hosts.

I accidentally stayed until 10:30pm!

So I had to walk home, alone, in the dark.

Through places full of everything that scares me.

Shadowy corners, strange rustling noises, the occasional man wandering by.

(I always cross the street when I see one.)

Through *campus*.

Bleh.

Going onto campus always fills me with a sense of dread. I feel it everywhere; through my whole body.

I‚Äôve been working really hard on my anxiety, so I‚Äôm a lot calmer than I used to be when I go there.

But the pit in my stomach doesn‚Äôt leave until I do.

Even after I get home, the feeling stays with me sometimes. I have to force myself to relax.

Anyways, now I‚Äôm home and in bed and exhausted.

But not exhausted in my usual, depressed way.

I‚Äôm just worn out, because I did a lot.

It feels good.

It feels *normal*.

I wish every day could feel like this.

And hey- I finally made a normal diary entry!

Now that I have people who always ask me how my day was, I‚Äôve gotten better at sharing the details.

I used to not know how.

But it gets easier with practise.

I‚Äôm so grateful to have people who taught me how to share. I can‚Äôt believe how lucky I am!

I hope I‚Äôm worth listening to."

My life is about to be insane

I woke up at 7 and worked on a packing list all morning. I started gathering all my things together.

Even started on that stupid drawing.

I showed my dad and he was very unimpressed. It kind of hurts sometimes.

I went out to lunch and went to shop for last minute camp stuff at target with grandma.

And I did two loads of laundry. Packed some more.

Went to church, I recorded the sermon for Ali because she was gone.

I didn‚Äôt want to talk in small groups but it didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt want to be there. I just am shy. I had to force myself to talk towards the end so L didn‚Äôt question me.

I feel so loved today. People keep telling me how much they‚Äôre going to miss me while I‚Äôm gone. It‚Äôs only three weeks, but that‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve been away from home ever.

My stepmom told me that my dad cried because he missed my sister and I so much while we were at camp. He just acts like he doesn‚Äôt care all the time but I guess he really does love us.

My grandma said she‚Äôll miss me too.

My whole small group, and even my older friends as well.

Even M and L said they‚Äôd kind of miss me.

I‚Äôll have my phone so I‚Äôll be able to contact anyone but still.

I promised SO many people I‚Äôd face time or call them or text them while I was gone. I really don‚Äôt know if I can keep up with it all.

Ughhh but I finished packing. I‚Äôll have to do some last minute packing Sunday morning/Saturday night but it‚Äôll be fine!

These family reunions are so BORING. I really struggle with liking my grandparents and I hope they aren‚Äôt too critical of my art/ ME.

I just plan on chilling out in our lawn chairs the whole time. I‚Äôll bring my sketchbook. I‚Äôll hopefully get some time to hang out with my ‚Äúcousins.‚Äù

They‚Äôre so different. The older one is this little know-it-all who thinks he‚Äôs the smartest kid ever, and while he IS super smart, he lacks in maturity and wisdom.

The younger one is a lot of fun and tries to live up to his brother but doesn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs still pretty young. I remember when he was just a tiny baby. I remember before he was even born‚Äî dang.

I‚Äôm going to listen to podcasts all 5 hours there and 5 back. That reminds me, I need to download them tonight! I‚Äôll bring a book just in case if I remember.

Stranger things comes out tomorrow and I‚Äôm sad I won‚Äôt be able to see if for four more weeks. Ughhh.

Also this may be the last time I see my great grandma. I feel so much guilt for not knowing her more. I know I‚Äôll feel guilty when she dies, but if I‚Äôm honest with myself, I don‚Äôt feel like taking on the task to know her more.

Maybe that‚Äôs a horrible thing to say but whatever.

Maybe I‚Äôll have a couple more times to go out to see her. She‚Äôs pretty resilient.

I should go download those podcasts now and go to bed."
0,"I don‚Äôt want help
I don‚Äôt ask for help or advice when it comes to being happy. It‚Äôs like I know what advice I‚Äôm gonna get. It‚Äôs just the fact that I don‚Äôt want to get better. So I could know everything and still not feel any different because I‚Äôd rather sleep for 24 of the day than actually improve. Kind of sucks that it feels like my human drive to thrive has been destroyed."
0,"Another day!
Im pretty sure I forgot to post yesterday but meh. These last few days have been amazing. I‚Äôve been putting myself out there. I didn‚Äôt realize that men actually want to date me. My self esteem has shot through the roof. I think I am ready to date. Nothing super serious. Just some hang out and have sex type thing. My mom has been acting weird with me. She thinks it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm out having casual sex since I‚Äôm not the type to do so. She said I continue to keep my walls up and I‚Äôm going to end up where I was when Josh left. To be honest I haven‚Äôt really thought of falling in love. My ex husband was in town and it was a shit show. He told me that I should stop trying to fill the hole in my heart. He is kind of right. I don‚Äôt like the guy but he knows me better than most people do. I don‚Äôt ever want to feel that emptiness when you fall in love. When Josh left it was a very hard lesson. I was so broken and toxic. Ugh, I don‚Äôt want to go down the rabbit hole. I‚Äôm going to continue to put myself out there."

Yesterday

I moped around and did nothing

Went with my sister to the Apple store to get her phone fixed at 4

Ate dinner at schlotzskys. Split a pizza with my sister and bought a Cinnabon for desert.

After that my dad and sister dropped me off at the movie theater. I sat around waiting inside for someone else to show up that I knew.

I saw K walk in. He stood on the other side of the lobby area looking at his phone. I stood up and called to him. He didn‚Äôt hear. Then I awkwardly stood in front of him until he looked up and was like oh hi.

We talked together for a little bit. Then finally B&B showed up so we went outside to wait for the others. We divided the tickets and went inside and found seats.

I sat on the isle next to B & E.

We saw Spider-Man: Far From Home.

It was AWESOME and hilarious.

The end scene was CRAZY. It‚Äôs too bad J had to leave just before it. The end scene changes everything for spider man.

Anyways I won‚Äôt spoil because it only came out yesterday.

But today is gonna be a crazy nightmare.

I need to shower, do my laundry, go out to lunch with my grandma and get something from target, stop by the bank, pack for family reunion, also pack for art camp, do that stupid ass drawing for the family reunion, have dinner sometime, go to youth group.

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I wish I had one more day. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to go to this stupid reunion. It‚Äôs not the reunion I hate, it‚Äôs my grandparents.

At least I get to see my chill grandma today."
0,"02.07.19. Life insurance
The life insurance lady came today.

It went better than I thought it would.

I lied, obviously, which is *technically* insurance fraud. So... we‚Äôll see how that goes, I guess.

But I told more of the truth than I planned to!

I think it helped that the nurse liked me- she went a lot easier on me than she could have.

...And that she came an hour early, so I didn‚Äôt have time to clean. She sat at my desk and put her forms right next to the used pipe sitting there.

So it wasn‚Äôt exactly like I could say I‚Äôve never smoked.

Plus, she took my blood and urine. So I guess it‚Äôs better I told her up front rather than getting caught.

But I lied when she asked me if I have any suicide attempts.

And when she ran through a checklist of mental health diagnoses, she didn‚Äôt ask if I have PTSD.

After all, why would she?

I‚Äôm just a regular college kid.

So I didn‚Äôt tell her.

And I told her I only smoke ‚Äúsocially; a couple times a month,‚Äù and that I rarely drink, and that I‚Äôve never done any other substances.

Of course she believed me.

She asked when I last smoked and I said Sunday.

That was the truth.

(Because I was too depressed yesterday to get out of bed at all, even to smoke. But I didn‚Äôt tell her that.)

So hopefully my medical records really are private, and my parents can‚Äôt see the results of my tests.

Because weed is definitely going to show up.

And so is depression.

(That one was on the checklist, unfortunately.)

When she was finished asking questions, she pulled out a scale and told me to get on it.

The number was lower than I thought.

Like, a *lot* lower.

I made her double-check it.

But that was really the number.

I calculated my BMI after she left.

It was... normal.

Really scraping the upper limit of normal, obviously. I‚Äôm like 0.4 points away from being overweight.

But I thought I already *was* overweight.

I feel like a fat, disgusting blob.

But apparently, I‚Äôm... not?

I‚Äôm just a regular, disgusting blob.

Weird.

I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you starve yourself. I only started eating again a few months ago.

So even though I‚Äôve gained a *lot* of weight, I guess I was just catching up.

It‚Äôs definitely time to stop now, though.

I hope I can.

I‚Äôve been binging a lot lately.

This is like when I got my assessment results back and they said my scores were too high to be learning disabled.

I was *shocked*.

I truly thought I was stupid.

I remember walking out of one of the appointments and thinking: *Well, at least they‚Äôll definitely give me accommodations now. I really fucked that one up.*

I even apologized to the testers during the assessment for being so bad at it!

...They wrote that in the report.

Said I have ‚Äúpoor self-concept.‚Äù

Whatever *that* means.

But numbers don‚Äôt lie.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always liked about them.

I‚Äôm not learning disabled, and I‚Äôm not fat, either.

I still *feel* stupid.

...But I also still feel fat.

(I mean, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm skinny. I could stand to lose 15lbs or so. But I felt like a balloon before.)

God, what else don‚Äôt I know about myself?

I almost had a panic attack when it was time to take my blood and the nurse pulled out this giant needle.

I had to run and get my housemate, who‚Äôs a nurse too, because I‚Äôm a pathetic little bitch who‚Äôs afraid of the doctor. Well, the nurse. Anyone with big needles, really.

At least she wasn‚Äôt a doctor!

That made it a lot less scary.

I *hate* doctors.

But they were both really nice to me- my housemate and the nurse.

(And they‚Äôre both nurses! Yay nurses!)

My housemate asked, ‚ÄúCan I hug you?‚Äù

And I nodded, so she held me while the lady put the needle in. I really appreciated that she asked first.

That helped so much!

And she had me look right at her and talked about funny, distracting things so I wouldn‚Äôt be as scared.

And I squeezed my unicorn pillow really tight.

When it was over, the nurse even gave me a compliment for holding my arm so still!

So that was nice.

I did a good job! :)

I‚Äôm still not looking forward to doing this again on Friday for the autoimmune tests.

But my housemate said she would come with me.
And she really helped today.

I don‚Äôt think I could have done it without her.

And after, she even got me a glass of water and went upstairs to get my unicorn pillow for me when I was too woozy to get it myself.

She‚Äôs so, so good to me.

I don‚Äôt deserve her.

(But I‚Äôm really grateful that she thinks I do. Lol!)

When the nurse was packing up, we made idle small chat while I tried to calm down.

She commented on how anxious I was.

So I told her: ‚ÄúI think that was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever been through!‚Äù

The nurse laughed and said: ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

She took one look at me.

Me, with all my privilege.

Me, with my cheerful demeanour.

Me, with my big, pink unicorn pillow that I needed to because I was so afraid of a stupid blood test.

People like me don‚Äôt have real problems.

So I shrugged and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a very easy life.‚Äù

And the nurse said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù"

0,"02.07.19. My mom is worried about me
Yesterday, my mom asked me how my course is going and I said I‚Äôm tired of it.

So she thought that meant I needed to find a new career, one I would be less tired of.

She said: ‚ÄúIf you can picture yourself doing anything, what would excite you?‚Äù

I thought about it for a second.

Then I said: ‚ÄúHonestly, I can‚Äôt picture anything exciting me.‚Äù

Later, my mom referenced back to that.

And she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about you.‚Äù

What the fuck?

Why did she say that?

It‚Äôs confusing, because I thought that was what I always wanted.

But now it‚Äôs happened, and it doesn‚Äôt feel the way I thought it would.

All I could think was: *Oh, **now** you‚Äôre worried?*

Where was she last summer, when I needed her?

She was there.

She just wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

She once came into my room and the whole place stunk of weed, because my friend and I were smoking in there.

My mom said: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù

We said nothing.

Then my mom noticed a bowl of food I‚Äôd left on my desk from dinner. It had been sitting there for two hours or so.

She wrinkled her nose and started screaming at me.

‚ÄúYou disgusting pig, what the fuck is wrong with you? You‚Äôre stinking up the entire house with your filth! Why do you do this? Honestly, you even have a guest over! God, you‚Äôre so disgusting. How can you treat her like this? Take that downstairs and wash it right now! God, you disgust me. Did I really raise you like this?‚Äù

So I took it downstairs and washed it.

And that was the end of that.

When I went back to my room, my friend said: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck just happened?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

My mom wasn‚Äôt worried about me then.

I was doing drugs in my bedroom to cope, and she was only worried about what my friend might think of a dirty bowl on my desk.

Or when I was staying out of the house all night, sometimes for days on end. Bouncing around from couch to work to a different couch back to work.

On Friday afternoons, I would disappear for the whole weekend. I‚Äôd stay wherever I could, as long as I was out of the house and able to get high.

One time I stayed at a McDonald‚Äôs tripping my balls off until 4am. I don‚Äôt even remember what I took.

I stumbled home around 7:30am.

My hair was a mess, my eyes were glazed over, and yesterday‚Äôs rumpled work clothes reeked of booze.

My mom asked: ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúOut.‚Äù

And I went upstairs to change.

My mom wasn‚Äôt worried then, either.

Or what about during winter break, when my dad trapped me in an elevator and touched my back after I told him not to?

He set off my flashbacks and made me cry.

Trapped, in that stupid fucking elevator.

Where was my mom then?

Oh right- she was in the elevator, too.

Laughing right alongside my dad.

She told me to stop being so dramatic.

That I‚Äôd never had a problem with anyone touching my back before, so stop making up problems.

I tried to kill myself a month later.

She never once worried.

Or what about when I was 12 years old, and decided to stop going to school?

I would sleep for 3 days in a row - just like I did this weekend - and my mom wouldn‚Äôt even notice.

She wouldn‚Äôt make me go to school.

She never even tried to get me out of bed.

On the second day, sometimes she would come check to make sure I was still alive, and she‚Äôd bring me a glass of water or slice of toast or something.

She would say: ‚ÄúDo you feel like going to school today?‚Äù

From under the covers, without moving a muscle or even opening my eyes, I would mutter: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

And she would leave again.

She wasn‚Äôt worried then, either.

Not until I tried to kill myself a year later.

And even then, she wasn‚Äôt worried until the doctor told her she‚Äôd better be.

Where was she when I needed her?

Why wasn‚Äôt she worried?

I needed her then.

I don‚Äôt anymore.

I went through two suicide attempts, countless drugs, self-harm, depressive spirals, reckless behaviour, and even went on medical leave after failing out of school.

She never even noticed.

Occasionally, she would get mad at me for being moody or misbehaving.

But she *never* worried.

And now, I‚Äôm just a little tired.

*Now* she chooses to care?

*This* is when she decides to show up?

My mom doesn‚Äôt *get* to worry about me now.

Now that I‚Äôm easier, now that my problems don‚Äôt scare her or make her feel like a bad parent.

Now, all of a sudden, she wants to step up?

*Now* she wants to be there for me?

It‚Äôs too late.

I don‚Äôt want her anymore.

And I fucking *hate* that she thinks she has the right to insert herself where she doesn‚Äôt belong in my life.

When we got off the phone, my mom sent me a text:

*Love you*

I didn‚Äôt even notice it for 20 minutes. When I did, I wrote back:

*Don‚Äôt be clingy*

She sent me a laughing emoji.

I never responded."

I kind of went overboard yesterday.

But I don‚Äôt take any of it back.

I went to the doctor for the first time in like 4-5 years.

It was strange.

The office hadn‚Äôt changed much in all the years I‚Äôd been going.

I sat next to my dad in the waiting room.

I heard a nurse call my name and I followed her into the back where we stopped at a scale.

Not the scale. Anything but the scale.

It said I weighed 10 pounds more than what my scale at home says.

And I was one inch shorter than I had thought.

Then she led my dad and I into a small room with a table I had to sit on and a chair for my dad.

The nurse was going over my dad/I's info. We had to update our address. She asked if Melinda was still my mother and my dad paused and says no, she is deceased.

The lady went ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I almost teared up but I didn‚Äôt.

She left and the doctor came in.

The doctor asked me questions about any medications I was taking, how my period was going, if I was exercising, eating healthy, etc. and then she was asking my dad about family medical history.

She asked my dad if the info they had on my mom was correct. The woman said she had a history of alcoholism, anxiety and depression, bipolar, etc.

I didn‚Äôt know about the alcoholism. This was news to me. My mom had never told me she‚Äôs had a drink in her life, but I didn‚Äôt ask.

My mom was a wreck. My mom was just like me.

I miss her.

Now that we were on the subject of my dead mom the doctor asked me how I was doing. She asked if I‚Äôd been experiencing anxiety or depression. I said no. What was I supposed to say? My dad was right there.

She asked if I‚Äôd ever talked to a counselor and I said no. She asked if I wanted to. I said not really.

My dad was there. Watching me.

Then she started talking about the HPV vaccine and how it can prevent sexually transmitted diseases etc.

My dad said he was going to hold off on it. Apparently my mom once told him that she never wanted the girls to get it.

Eventually she left and another woman came in to give me my meningitis shot. It was quick and didn‚Äôt hurt. I got a bandaid with roller skating dinosaurs.

We left and got in the car and never said a peep.

I emailed the lady from the college and told her I got my vaccine.

Now I can go.

I‚Äôm excited and nervous.

I‚Äôm so excited about the possibility to see F again.

I really am starting to miss him. Although I feel extremely guilty for not having made much, but I still miss him.

I sat on the toilet looking at my thighs.

I ran my fingers over the scars.

I hate my body. I hate what I‚Äôve done to myself.

I want to make art.

I want to be free,

I need a break.

My sister is progressively getting more cruel with each passing day.

I should pray for her."
0,"01.07.19. The Giving Tree
Once there was a tree...
and she loved a little girl.
And everyday the girl would come
and think of all the things she would like to do:
she would gather the tree‚Äôs leaves
and make them into crowns
and play queen of the forest.
She would climb up her trunk
and swing from her branches
and eat apples
and they would play hide-and-go-seek.
And when she was tired,
she would sleep in the tree‚Äôs shade.
And the girl was so excited to do it all.
And the girl loved the tree...
very much.
And the tree was happy.

But when the girl tried to gather leaves
and make them into crowns
The tree said: ‚ÄúYou look stupid.‚Äù
And when the girl
went to climb up the tree‚Äôs trunk
and play in her branches
the tree said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too heavy.‚Äù
And when they would play
hide-and-go-seek,
the tree would get distracted
by a phone call
and stop looking for the girl.
So the girl ate apples by herself
while the tree was
busy with
more important things.
And when the girl was tired
she would curl up to sleep in the shade
but the tree was tired too
and had worked very hard
much harder than the girl, who was lazy
and the tree
was just under a lot of stress right now.
So instead of sleeping
the girl would use all her might
to hold up the tree, so the tree could rest.
Because the girl loved the tree...
very much.
And the tree was happy.

But time went by.
And the girl grew older.
And the tree was often alone.
Then one day the girl came to the tree
and the tree said, ""Come, Girl, come and
climb up my trunk and swing from my
branches and eat apples and play in my
shade and be happy.""
""I am too big to climb and play"" said
the girl.
‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre a selfish, spoiled bitch,‚Äù said the tree,  ‚ÄúStop acting like a brat and be grateful.‚Äù
And the girl did nothing.
And the tree said,
‚ÄúI gave you everything
and this is the thanks I get?
I let you gather my leaves
and climb on my trunk
and play in my branches
and eat all my apples
and sleep in my shade.
I love you more than anyone.
Why do you treat me this way?‚Äù
Then the tree said nothing else,
and neither did the girl.
Until the girl left
and the tree was alone.

But then one day the girl came back
And the tree shook with joy.
And the girl said,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, tree,
I‚Äôm sorry.
I should have climbed
on your trunk and swung from your
branches.
Not everyone has a tree,
and I‚Äôm very lucky to have such a good one.
You always give me apples
when I‚Äôm hungry and
shade over my head when
I need somewhere to sleep.‚Äù
And the tree was happy.

‚ÄúI want you to buy things
and have fun,‚Äù said the tree,
‚ÄúBecause I am such a good tree.
Take my apples, Girl, and sell them in
the city. Then you will have money and
you will be happy.""
The girl said, ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want money.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave I spoiled you that much?‚Äù said the tree.
‚ÄúNot everyone has a tree
who gives them money.
Some trees don‚Äôt love
their little girls the way
I love you.
Show some respect and be grateful.‚Äù
And so the girl climbed up the
tree and gathered her apples
and carried them away.
And the tree was happy.

But the girl stayed away for a long time...
and the tree was sad.
And then one day the girl came back
and the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak.
And she said, ""Come, Girl,
climb up my trunk
and swing from my
branches and be happy.""
""I am too busy to climb trees,"" said the girl.
And the tree said
‚ÄúOh, *you‚Äôre* so busy?
And how do you think I got
you all those apples?
By sitting around doing nothing?
I gave you everything
and this is the thanks I get?‚Äù
So the girl promised to call more.
And the tree was happy.

But then the girl stayed away
for a long time again.
And when she came back,
the tree was less happy
and she hardly spoke.
""Ungrateful girl,"" she whispered,
""Why should I love you
when you clearly don‚Äôt love me?
Why don‚Äôt you
play with me anymore?
We always used to play
when you were little
and you loved it so.‚Äù
""I am too old and sad to play,""
said the girl.
‚ÄúYou know nothing
of age or sadness,‚Äù
said the tree. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand
what real pain is
when you have a little girl
of your own someday.
See, this is why
you still need your tree.
You clearly don‚Äôt know
what‚Äôs best for you.
Now be a good girl
and come play in my branches.‚Äù
But the girl did not want to listen
to the tree anymore.
""I want a boat that will
take me far away from here.
Can you give me a boat?""
""Cut down my trunk
and make a boat,"" said the tree.
""Then you can sail away...
and be happy.""
And so the girl cut down the tree‚Äôs trunk
and made a boat and sailed away.
‚ÄúGood riddance,‚Äù said the tree.
And the tree was happy
... but not really.

And after a long time
the girl came back again.
""I am sorry, Girl,""
said the tree,""but I have nothing
left to give you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for anything,‚Äù said the girl.
‚ÄúI am sorry,"" sighed the tree.
""I wish that I could give you something...
but I have nothing left.
I am just an old stump.
I am sorry...""
And the girl knew then
that she had a very special tree.
Hers was a Giving Tree-
one who, for better or for worse,
could only love
by giving her everything.
""I don't need very much now,"" said the girl,
""just a quiet place to sit and rest.
I am very tired.""
""Well,"" said the tree, straightening
herself up as much as she could,
""well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting.
Come, Girl, sit down. Sit down and rest.""
And the girl did.
And the tree was happy."

Happy [Canada Day](https://imgur.com/gallery/QKNMeBo)!

My housemates burst into my room and DEMANDED that we go outside and take group photos RIGHT NOW.

I was still in bed.

I told them to go without me.

But they, dressed in bright reds and summer clothes, dragged me out to the backyard, with my grey sweats and black t-shirt and unwashed hair.

They said, if I didn‚Äôt want to be in any pictures, I should at least be the photographer.

(Also, one of my housemates was in a hurry and they didn‚Äôt have time to set up the tripod.)

So I did a photo shoot with them, under the bright sunshine, while they ran around laughing and posing.

It was fun to watch them enjoy themselves.

And we got some good pictures.

I‚Äôll enjoy editing them later, now that I‚Äôm back in bed.

I‚Äôm grateful that my friends still want me there, even though I‚Äôm just a dark cloud hanging over them.

But I wish I wasn‚Äôt so tired.

I wish I was that carefree.

They *wanted* to celebrate.

I wish I wanted to do anything.

But I don‚Äôt.

I just wanted to go back to bed.

...

Update:

My housemates are downstairs playing ‚ÄúSweet Caroline‚Äù on the piano and singing along.

I‚Äôm *still* just in bed.

And honestly, even though I can hear how much fun they‚Äôre having, I just wish they would stop.

I find all the sunshine and happy music and celebrating annoying. I want it to stop so I can sleep in peace.

...What the *fuck* is wrong with me?

A few years ago, on Canada Day, I painted my entire face to look like the flag, and ran around covered head to toe in a red jumpsuit with a flag draped around me like a cape.

I‚Äôve always *loved* celebrating.

I once put together a calendar that had a national holiday for every day, so I‚Äôd always have something to celebrate.

I‚Äôve always been the one running around screaming and laughing and dancing without a care in the world.

I was always the person who wanted to get in the spirit.

And I hated people who brought down the mood.

After all, why couldn‚Äôt they just be happy?

Now, I feel like the Grinch.

This isn‚Äôt me.

Something is wrong.

The mental illness is winning.

And I don‚Äôt know how to stop it.

...God, that music is so fucking irritating.

Why can‚Äôt they all just shut the fuck up?

0,"01.07.19. The giant cat wheel
My mom once bought a five-foot-tall wheel for the cat to run on because she felt like he was getting too fat.

So we lured my cat into the basement, dangled a toy in there, and held it over his head while he jumped on and started jogging in a fruitless attempt to reach it.

He lost interest pretty quickly.

So now we just have a massive, useless hamster wheel in our basement.

People always find it funny when they come over and ask what it is and I explain to them that it was for our cat‚Äôs exercise regimen.

One time I even tried to crawl in there and run in it, too-  the cat‚Äôs not the only one who needs more exercise!

(I almost broke it, and myself. Guess I should have paid more attention to the 30-pound weight limit.)

But even though I didn‚Äôt fit, sometimes I still feel like the cat running in that ridiculous wheel.

All the effort I put into changing - everything I did to pull myself out of the hole I dug myself into - it was all so exhausting.

I kept telling myself it would be worth it in the end, because I would be better. Everything would be.

Was I just wearing myself out with all that work?

I tried as hard as I know how and I‚Äôm still failing.

Still skipping school.

Still can‚Äôt get out of bed.

Still miserable and stressed and sad.

I gave it my all and it didn‚Äôt make a difference.

Now I‚Äôm too tired to keep going, and I‚Äôm still right where I started.

I wonder, was I ever going anywhere at all?

What was the point of trying?

I‚Äôm gonna be stuck in that same spot on the wheel no matter what. I could sprint, jog, walk, cartwheel; nothing would change.

The wheel just keeps spinning, with me at the bottom.

It doesn‚Äôt go anywhere or do anything.

It just wastes time and energy.

So why bother getting up at all?

I‚Äôm going nowhere.

And I‚Äôm so tired of running."

I don‚Äôt want to be the same anymore.

And get ready for a cheesy, girl just got back from summer camp and is going to change her life.

But I think I mean it this time.

I had a long talk/walk with L the third night at camp.

I‚Äôd been really depressed and just couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone until she asked me what was wrong.

I opened up to her about how I felt about my mom dying. How angry I am and was towards God. How totally distant I‚Äôve been.

And I‚Äôve never talked to anyone face to face about that.

But I‚Äôm really glad I did. Because at the end of the day, I need Jesus.

I‚Äôve struggled to hard trying to do it on my own the last few years, and I just forgot how good it was to trust Him.

And being with my church all week and hearing truth, I just felt such peace knowing that this world is not my home. That God has a plan.

And a week ago I was so far removed from God I would have laughed at myself.

But I know in my heart of hearts and even from experience that following my heart leads me no were good and I can‚Äôt rely on myself.

The only time in my life I‚Äôve felt at peace is trusting God.

And something happened today I didn‚Äôt expect in the least.

Alex shared her testimony of how the Lord had worked through her at camp this week. And she‚Äôs decided to place her trust in Him.

And she wrote this beautiful speech she said to our small group. And after it was done, I have never felt such joy.

I know her so well. I got her a job where I work. I keep up on all her drama with boys and everything. But a week ago she didn‚Äôt claim to be a Christian.

I related to so much of what she said I started bawling, and so did a half dozen other girls. I was so 100% not expecting it.

And I just thought. If God can change her heart, He can change mine.

And it‚Äôs true. I know he can. I have a hard time trusting though. I‚Äôm just so used to relying on myself.

I finally feel like my life isn‚Äôt heading downhill and praise God for that.

It‚Äôs going to be hard. I really struggle with what people will think of me.

Even writing this is hard. I‚Äôm terrified of losing the respect of the people in my life.

But like Philippians 3:8 says;

‚ÄúMore than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,‚Äù

And I wish my heart desired it to be true. I pray that God would change me.

I‚Äôm sick of wallowing in my unworthiness and helplessness.

I need Christ."

And I hated my mother, for being too weak to fight back; for letting it happen.

I got attacked by a cat today during my volunteer shift, then missed my bus and had to walk through a really sketchy, isolated area.

...Plus, I missed my housemate‚Äôs birthday.

So by the time I got home, I was pretty stressed out.

All I wanted to do was curl up in a ball in bed and pity myself until it was late enough for me to get high.

But the second I stepped through the door, my housemate said: ‚ÄúOh good, you‚Äôre home!‚Äù

She had 300 water balloons, a wiffle ball, baseball bat, and apparently, a boring day.

She wanted to do something fun, with all four of us.

First, we tried playing baseball outside.

...We hit a car.

Luckily the owner was super nice about it, and wasn‚Äôt mad at all.

Just kidding!

We ran.

(The car was fine; I checked when I grabbed the ball.)

Then, once we were safely back inside, my housemate thought it would be funny to throw a water balloon at me. It splattered all over the kitchen.

So I did the mature thing, and dumped a glass of water over her head.

...And all over our wooden floor.

We ended up having a water fight in the kitchen.

Our only responsible housemate was not impressed.

(Worth it.)

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt just get high and go to bed.

It‚Äôs been harder lately, because my depression has really kicked in. I‚Äôm sort of just drifting through life.

I don‚Äôt really feel anything except anxious and empty and irritated.

I‚Äôve mostly just been passing time, waiting for all this to be over one way or another.

But I‚Äôm grateful to have housemates who drag me out when I want to stay in.

They give me a break from all the shit in my head.

I don‚Äôt deserve it, but I‚Äôm too selfish to let them go.

They make me happy, even if it doesn‚Äôt last long.

And they remind me that in the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm really lucky.

I have friends who support me emotionally, and parents who support me financially.

I have a second chance at school and a really fun volunteer job and a nice house and enough money to buy takeout when I‚Äôm too depressed to cook (which is often) and as much weed as I want.

I have a family that loves me, even if sometimes they have funny ways of showing it. Not everyone has that.

(My family‚Äôs not malicious. They‚Äôre just idiots. But they don‚Äôt hurt me on purpose- I got really lucky there.)

And I have other people that I genuinely care about, who care about me, too. Not everyone has that, either.

I don‚Äôt want to take any of this for granted.

Things could be a whole lot worse.

I am in a constant state of feeing not good enough for anyone.

Pep talk- remember to smile and text the ones I care about today. Let them know how important they are and that I appreciate them. Remember to look down at the flowers and up at the sky to remember how incredibly lucky I am to be alive regardless of how much my heart tells me I don‚Äôt want to live. Remember to have an open heart and an open mind. Healing takes time. It‚Äôs ok to be sad.

Then I just closed my eyes and listened to her play.

She couldn‚Äôt believe I actually wanted her to continue.

I couldn‚Äôt believe she thought I wanted her to stop.

Maybe it was the drugs, but I thought it sounded nice.

Eventually, the food arrived, and we moved to the kitchen table to eat.

I thought about other topics of conversation, when I realized we had nothing left to talk about for the day.

I thought about how awkward it was to eat in silence with someone, until I realized she was doing it too.

And I thought about how neither of us really felt the need to talk at all.

It was just nice to have each other‚Äôs company.

Then our other housemate got home.

He said: ‚ÄúWhat were you guys doing?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

My housemate raised his eyebrows.

He said: ‚ÄúReally, you‚Äôve just been doing nothing for the past hour?‚Äù

depression fucks with me again this week. somehow i manage to get all the homework in my computer class done.i worked on it from 6pm to 1 am so it took Alot of effort. only homework left is my english class. i have not been doing so hot because writing requires alot of thinking and i cant think at all. i been looking online for help and guide and non of them work. it makes me more upset and frustrated because i don't understand the work. i really just want to give up on that class and not turn in any work. i wanted to use a paid ghostwriting service but it is too much money. my back is against the wall and i have no help at all. being depressed doesn't help at all. im not looking up essay guides anymore tonight. im too upset and i really want to go crazy."

My housemate got raped a year ago today.

This has led us to have some pretty... interesting conversations when we‚Äôre alone.

Today, we had one that went like this:

Her: ‚ÄúWould you rather: be gang raped but can‚Äôt remember most of it, or get raped by just one person but you remember it all?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWould you rather: be gang raped or molested? Oh, wait...‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúHaha, good one. Would you rather: shave your eyebrow off, or-‚Äù

Me: ‚Äú-get raped?‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúI was gonna say chug that entire 2L bottle of vodka. What the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù

...Cue our hysterical laughter.

She‚Äôs handling her one-year anniversary pretty well.

Humour‚Äôs a pretty good coping mechanism.

She‚Äôs the strongest person I know.

It‚Äôs not fair.

I wish she didn‚Äôt have to be strong.

And I wish we didn‚Äôt need humour to cope.

But since we do, it‚Äôs at least nice to have someone to laugh with."
0,"26.06.19. My room
My housemates hung out in my room last night.

...Which is *insane*.

No one ever hangs out in my room.

People barely even come into my room at all.

Some people like having friends in their room. One of my housemates even sometimes asks me to come into hers, because she enjoys hosting!

Not me.

If my housemates need to ask me something, they‚Äôll come in for as long as it takes to get the answer, and then leave.

Everyone knows it‚Äôs not personal, I just hate having people in my room.

It‚Äôs *my* room.

If I want to hang out, I‚Äôll go downstairs.

Or go into one of their rooms, if they say it‚Äôs ok.

(They‚Äôve told me to stop asking, but I still do.)

I already thought it was pretty crazy of me that I left the door open the other day.

In my family‚Äôs house, doors are always closed - all of them, all the time.

And I‚Äôve always liked it that way.

It feels safe.

Like a fortress.

When I‚Äôm in my room, with the door closed (and usually also locked), I can let my guard down.

Because everything in my room is exactly the way it always is, and it‚Äôs all how I want it, too.

Plus, it‚Äôs totally safe from other people, who can change things and do whatever they want to my stuff.

Until yesterday.

I was high, eating pizza and hanging out as usual when two of my housemates barged in with a ridiculous idea they wanted to tell me about.

Next thing I knew, one of them was curled up in my comfy chair, arms wrapped around the stuffed unicorn pillow I keep there.

The other was flopped across my bed, moaning in comfort and asking where I got my mattress topper.

The weirdest part was, I was fine.

I didn‚Äôt mind them being there.

I was a little worried it would smell weird or they would notice a stain or something else that would give away how disgusting I truly am.

But if they thought it was gross, they did a good job hiding it. Not that I think there actually was anything.

I just get anxious.

But they weren‚Äôt.

They were just having a good time.

...In my room.

With me.

And all my personal stuff.

And they liked it!

They were relaxed.

And once I got used to it, so was I.

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would touch or break my stuff.

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would see how disgusting I am and not want to be my friend anymore.

...One of them even commented on how clean it is.

(Probably because she saw my bedroom in the last house, when I was too depressed to even clean broken glass off the floor. That room *was* gross.)

I wasn‚Äôt worried they would stay too long, or refuse to leave if I got tired and wanted to be alone.

...Probably because my housemates were as confused that this was happening as I was.

(They‚Äôve never not been allowed in my room. It‚Äôs just sort of an unspoken rule.)

But I trusted them to respect my space.

I trusted them to come into my space.

I trusted them enough to want them there.

...Then one of my housemates wondered if we should switch rooms and I was at the door in a second.

So I definitely still like having my own private space.

But... they were in my room."

Recently met a new guy through my best friends boyfriend. I don't know if I'm excited to meet someone new or if I'm excited to get out of this.

I do know I do not want any sort of relationship at this point of my life. I don't even want to get married. So there isn't much sense to start to build a relationship with someone just to have it go nowhere.
I'm rambling. I just do not want to make someone a rebound or idk. I just don't know and I think too much and then I get confused.

I don't love him. I don't even feel bad about this new guy.

I think I was staying up late because I was unsatisfied and wanted something more. Like the night wasn't over yet because there was something more I hadn't done yet. A feeling, a *craving* that just hadn't been filled.

I felt good today though hanging with my brother, eating with good company, and feeling sweetness from my coworker. I think I'll sleep alright."

Didn‚Äôt do much today. Woke up, watched a movie, ate lunch, got my braces taken off.

That was painful and required a whole lot more drilling than I thought. I can still hear the drills ringing in my ear. It won‚Äôt stop and it‚Äôs kind of scaring me.

May have to put on some music to sleep.

I face timed A for a while and I packed all of my clothes for camp. I‚Äôm all packed except for some stuff I need to throw in the bag in the morning.

I‚Äôm taking a video camera. It‚Äôs not mine, I just forgot to return it to F before the school year ended. It‚Äôll be fine, I know he probably doesn‚Äôt mind.

I don‚Äôt want to look like one of those vloggers though. That‚Äôs the last thing I want to be seen as.

After dinner I FaceTimed P. We talked for a while. I can tell she‚Äôs really excited. I‚Äôm really excited. I hope she can sleep tonight. She‚Äôs been suffering from insomnia lately.

I got a call from the lady in charge of organizing things for the art camp I‚Äôm attending. Or ‚Äúresidency‚Äù as she calls it. Bullshit. It‚Äôs kind of a residency I guess but don‚Äôt make it fancier than it is.

Apparently I hadn‚Äôt turned in some immunization paperwork and I found out I was missing a vaccine.

My dad was just like, I‚Äôll schedule an appointment for next week. And just like that.

I hate getting shots. Oh god I hope they don‚Äôt look at my arm too much. My dad will be there. He‚Äôs never really stared at my arm. Maybe they‚Äôll do it in my right I hope. The scars have faded but sometimes when the light is right they are noticeable if you‚Äôre looking at them.

I‚Äôm okay with opening up to my dad about me cutting my arm. I‚Äôll just tell him it was a thing I went through. Just a phase. The scars on my arm aren‚Äôt bad and they look really old.

They‚Äôre all on my outer arm though. Except for the pale symbol I made on my forearm.

Anyways. I don‚Äôt need to be worried. I‚Äôm just making up problems that aren‚Äôt even there really.

I tried to watch another movie to kill time but it didn‚Äôt work. I can‚Äôt believe how fast today went by.

Well,

I leave for church camp tomorrow.

6 hours on a charter bus with 50 odd students.

Going to learn about God and literally break each other in extreme games.

Ironic maybe?

But we can‚Äôt bring phones.

Which makes me really paranoid. I know I‚Äôll have friends close.

But what IF. What if I have some sort of emotional crisis. Having internet access is one of the only things that have helped me with my anxiety the last few months.

Just knowing that help is out there. Anonymous help.

I‚Äôll probably be okay.

I hope Alyssa isn‚Äôt on my case too much.

At least she won‚Äôt be on the bus. She‚Äôs already there.

I‚Äôm really tired.

I hope I can sleep though. I had a hard time last night.

So goodbye dumb diary for 5 days.

I‚Äôll be sure to write all about it either Sunday or Monday.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll lose my streak but I haven‚Äôt been keeping track.

Bye for now."

My mom makes me so mad sometimes.

She called me today out of nowhere, just to talk.

Which was fine.

Until she asked if I was coming home this weekend.

I said probably not, since my housemate got reconcussed and it‚Äôs probably best I stay nearby.

Then my mom started asking me 10 million useless questions about that.

She told me I should take her to the hospital.

I said I already did.

She told me we should hire someone to get all the puke out of the carpet.

I told her I already cleaned the carpet.

She said: ‚ÄúI really think you should hire someone. You can‚Äôt just walk around with puke-y carpets.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt fucking ask you!

We don‚Äôt *have* puke-y carpets.

I cleaned them *twice*.

With carpet cleaner!

I took my housemate to the hospital, at 3am.

I bought her sunglasses and gave her medicine and watched her symptoms and sat with her while she was in pain and did everything else you‚Äôre supposed to do for someone with a head injury.

I fucking DID all that already!

Why does she always assume I didn‚Äôt?

Everyone else said I did everything right.

But my mom always assumes I did it all wrong, if I even did it at all.

She always thinks I‚Äôm completely fucking useless, no matter what I do.

I ended up telling her my housemate‚Äôs mom cleaned the carpet.

Then she was satisfied.

Other people can do things right.

It‚Äôs just me who‚Äôs a useless failure.

If she thought I had done it alone, she would have hired a carpet cleaner to my house, and I wouldn‚Äôt have even found out until the guy rang the doorbell.

But I *did* do it alone.

And we don‚Äôt *need* a fucking carpet cleaner!"

My Spotify premium ran out today :-(

I can‚Äôt afford to buy premium till tomorrow, but there would be no point because I won‚Äôt have my phone for 5 days starting Wednesday.

I JUST REMEMBERED 4 DAYS TILL THE BLACK KEYS RELEASE THE NEW ALBUM AND IM FUCKING STOKED!

I‚Äôm pissed as hell I‚Äôll be singing about Jesus 288 miles away from home without a phone.

At least I still have podcasts. Until they find a way to integrate ads into podcasts, on top of the ones already in the podcasts.

I cleaned my room and finally washed my sheets for once. They were gross as any unkept teenagers bed is.

When I took off the sheet there was this other fitted sheet underneath I‚Äôve had to protect my mattress. All over it were like these lines of dried blood.

Probably from when I passed out after being satisfied with my cuts and just bled into my sheets. I don‚Äôt know HOW my step mom has not questioned me.

She‚Äôs washed that towel that had the bloody lines all over it. She literally returned pencil sharpener blades that were in my pants pocket when she did laundry. Probably has even seen the bloody tissues in my room.

I‚Äôm more careful now but how can she be so dumb. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm such a convincing actor?

And it‚Äôs not like she has the slightest clue I was sad/ am sad.

Anyways.

I changed my sheets and they‚Äôre all different shades of beige. With a knit throw on top. I‚Äôm testing which blanket to bring to camp since it‚Äôs not wise to bring my entire comforter.

I got my hair dyed. It doesn‚Äôt feel any different really. Just more saturated than it was this morning. Then I got my nails done AND DAMN.

I hadn‚Äôt had my nails done since before I got a job, and I rarely wear nail polish‚Äî in fact, I choose not to wear it because it‚Äôs just extra hassle no one gives a shit about.

But I picked out this deep purple. And they told me to go sit down in this chair, and this cute boy sat down and started prepping his stuff.

I‚Äôve never had my nails done by a guy, but that‚Äôs not saying much because I‚Äôve only had them done twice.

But having a young, attractive guy hold your hand was the most amazing feeling in the world. I was super self conscious about my hands and fingers‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt care. It was just so nice having a cute guy hold my hand I wanted to melt into the chair.

I‚Äôve never held anyone‚Äôs hand for long‚Äî especially not a guy. Maybe in that square dancing unit in 5th grade‚Äî but that‚Äôs been it.

I‚Äôve never even kissed someone. I‚Äôm 17 and haven‚Äôt kissed a boy, meanwhile I overhear conversations of girls my age laugh at someone for not trying anal yet.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want physical affection‚Äî it would just be too stressful. First of all I‚Äôm a fat piece of shit, and even if someone liked me enough not to care, I couldn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm too paranoid of my parents. I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll find out. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I broke up with my fucking online boyfriend. There were more but that was one of them.

My dad has NEVER talked to me about boys. Not even a sex talk. Nothing. Nada. He just assumes I don‚Äôt care. Which is partially true, but I‚Äôm almost mad at him for ASSUMING I don‚Äôt care.

But for now, I‚Äôll settle for the cute guy at the nail salon holding my hand and clipping my dead skin and filing my nails. How romantic.

Ugh and I don‚Äôt know why but I broke my clean streak. I literally had ZERO reason to do so today. I found the pencil sharpener I‚Äôve been looking for while cleaning and it was just right there. Waiting for me.

If I want to be clean I can‚Äôt have blades in my room. Not even in the house‚Äî and if so, an inconvenient location. I want to throw it away but I can‚Äôt. I need the reassurance that it‚Äôs there in case I need it.

Even if it‚Äôs a stupid ass pencil sharpener blade.

But damn. Tomorrow is my last day home for a while. I‚Äôll need to pack for camp.

But I get my braces off.

I finally have more than two fucking bras and I am so happy. Maybe that‚Äôs a bit TMI, but I‚Äôve shared worse on this fucking subreddit.

I got to church at like 7:10. No one even came downstairs until 8:15. But I got to lay down on the couch for a while with the lights off so it worked out.

I was my usual old goofy self until Alyssa came in. I felt like she was watching me. I was reminded of Friday and felt nervous.

K bought 90 Capri suns and is gonna carry them around in a backpack at camp. I can‚Äôt believe he actually did it lmao.

Sometimes I look at him and feel like he‚Äôs smiling at me. In this weird way that is only him. I kind of like him. It‚Äôd probably never work, but I really enjoy his company. I wish we were better friends.

And suddenly since Friday, N actually knows I exist! I‚Äôm really proud of that, since we‚Äôve been going to church together since I started going when I was like 6.

Boys aside, rest of the day was smooth. It was long though. After lunch my stepmom took me to return some clothes and we ended up buying some much needed bras and she even bought my a pair of pants.

I really like her, she‚Äôs grown on me a lot in the last year. I feel like she‚Äôs been around forever sometimes.

Damn, I forgot to return my library books.

Also I had this FUCKING WEIRD DREAM LAST NIGHT. I was like roommates with Mr. Beast?? Like we shared a house? And all of a sudden I felt like I had to tell people who would know. And I told PewDiePie????

I don‚Äôt even really watch them. I sound like a 9 year old boy right now but I literally have no idea how that made it into my dreams. I did watch a little bit of his videos the other day but damn.

CG was crazy tonight. It was just my sisters friend and her little sister who came. We messed around, and played geo guesser for a while.

After they left we all sat down as a family at the dinner and had ice cream. It was nice in a weird way. My sister looked emotionally worn out.

But suddenly she became nice?? I went into her room and we started talking about camp and shit. We talked for an hour or two.

I don‚Äôt want to think about school. She got me thinking about school and I‚Äôm so over it. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being a socially anxious cunt. I‚Äôm sick of all my inner drama with F. I‚Äôm tired of school.

Anyways. School isn‚Äôt even on my radar rn.

I‚Äôve got damn church camp Wednesday and I‚Äôm excited as shit. I love my friends so much. Me and God got shit to work out, but in the meantime I‚Äôve got good friends.

I cleaned my face really well and did a face mask with my sister and I feel really clean.

Tomorrow I get my hair dyed and my grandma offered to do a manicure with us afterwards. And then Tuesday I get my braces off!!!

I hope she doesn‚Äôt do it too dark! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine.

And the new one is going away for two weeks after my first appointment with her.

But that doesn‚Äôt even matter, because I won‚Äôt be able to trust her or know what to talk about. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs gonna be there for me.

work been a living. 2 weeks ago this manager in training humiliated me in front of customers and employees and i spoke to my boss about it.things went ok but my boss spent a whole week giving me the cold shoulder. i noticed she gave me a closing shift with the manager in training this week. She knows i don't feel  comfortable working with her. this is why i hate her.

I called HR about the situation and they told me to take notes in case she gets out of line. I hate to call HR but i go to work to do my job, not to be harrassed and be told that im a stupid shithead.

I want to rip my emotions out.

Purge them from my brain and body.

You know, sometimes P makes a lot of suicide jokes and I get worried. I know she would NEVER, but I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs in a dark place right now.

But I know something she doesn‚Äôt. Her asshole manager that‚Äôs been giving her hell is best friends with a girl who hates her.

And the girl who hates her is (kind of) a friend of mine. It‚Äôs complicated but anyways, she quit and I‚Äôm so glad. I knew she would soon. I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt sooner.

But sometimes she kind of looks dead inside, when she‚Äôs not joking around and being herself.

It‚Äôs probably nothing, but maybe she‚Äôll tell me stuff at camp. We are sitting together on the bus for like 6 hours there and 6 back.

But god. I really hate myself. I woke up and there was this thunderstorm. At 7 in the morning! I saw the transformer blow across the street and the power went out.

I lit a candle and laid in my bed for a long time. I was absolutely exhausted. I‚Äôm mentally drained.

Then I remembered I had to have lunch with Alyssa today. I freaked out. She was 100% going to ask me what I‚Äôve been reading in the Bible and I haven‚Äôt read shit. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I just read on my own time.

I freaked out and read through Philippians once and a half. And watched a short summary video.

She picked me up and we went to this new chicken restaurant. Her two kids were in the car with her. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Being a mom is HARD. I kind of miss when she didn‚Äôt have kids. But her little boy is the sweetest kid on the planet.

When we were eating she asked me what I‚Äôd been reading. I told her and I just could NOT come up with the words to talk.

My brain was empty and I really just wanted to go home and cry. I can‚Äôt believe I put myself in this situation.

She talked the whole way home.

At least I didn‚Äôt have to do the talking. I said nothing. I was embarrassed and anxious. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs obvious. That maybe I‚Äôm not saved anymore.

I know I can‚Äôt lose salvation but like, it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve felt close to God.

And being totally honest I‚Äôm mad at him. For fucking up my life and killing my mom.

I got back in the house and just wanted to actually die. I turned off the lights and got into bed and just stared at the ceiling for a while.

I turned on a podcast. I didn‚Äôt want to think. I‚Äôm scared of being totally alone with my brain when I‚Äôm not feeling well. It has a habit of making things worse than they probably are.

I wanted to slice up my legs but I was so tired and useless I didn‚Äôt. At first anyways. Later I found that old exacto knife and drew a little blood but it just isn‚Äôt the same since the sharp edge broke off.

I felt guilty. Especially after last night. I know Milla told me that I could always talk to her when I had urges. But I just couldn‚Äôt.

It wasn‚Äôt something I could talk about to anyone at all.

But I got mad at my dumb knife and just laid there and kind of dozed in and out of consciousness for a couple hours.

Eventually I had to get up and get ready for work. I felt a lot better after having some resting time.

I went to work and found out that my new manager I don‚Äôt really like may have quit/got fired.

I may never work with S again. He‚Äôs probably going to quit in the next few weeks when I‚Äôm gone.

I debated not going to work tomorrow but I really fucking need the money bad.

We‚Äôre probably going to be understaffed too.

But after tomorrow I don‚Äôt work until the end of July. Woo hoo.

After work my sister and I went to a T-shirt decorating party for camp at a family from church‚Äôs house.

P and I made shirts that say, ‚ÄúIf lost return to P‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf lost return to (me.)‚Äù

They‚Äôre cute and I love them.

N commissioned me to draw this funny picture of J on his T-shirt for 5$.

Finally I got to impress everyone with my drawing skills.

We all talked for a while and I never usually talk to the guys. I really love my youth group. They are seriously the best people in the world.

I‚Äôm excited for camp.

I‚Äôm not excited about being confronted by Alyssa.

I just could NOT talk today. And it was obvious I was lying partially. I was exhausted and I told her that. I said I was sorry a bunch.

I think I should pray.

For once in my life.

Because the truth is, I wish I hadn‚Äôt strayed.

But if I hadn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd have built some of the friendships at school I have.

I really want to sleep."
0,"21.06.19. A nice night
I‚Äôm in a good mood.

It‚Äôs 10pm on a Friday night.

I‚Äôm smoking a bowl, nestled into my favourite spot on the steps in the backyard, right up against the railing.

There‚Äôs no one out except me and the stars.

My housemates are inside, waiting for me to come back in. We have plans to watch TV.

But that‚Äôs not for a few minutes.

 For now, I can stay right where I am.

Warm drafts of early-summer air breeze by, chilled just the right amount by the darkness of nighttime.

I can feel it brush past my skin; its coolness perfectly contrasts the heat sitting in the air.

I can smell it wash away the scents of yesterday‚Äôs sunshine as a new night sweeps everything clean.

...Maybe even the insides of my soot-soaked lungs.

Who knows?

They definitely feel clearer.

So does my head.

I feel like smiling, even though I don‚Äôt have anything in particular to smile about.

I just want to smile.

...God, I‚Äôm so extra when I‚Äôm high.

But I like how I feel right now."

At 9:30 grandma picked up my sister and I, we went to her house, she made us French toast.

At 11 we drove down to this park downtown that has a beautiful view of the skyline and is right on top of the river.

I went to Lilah‚Äôs at noon. He lives in this very normal house for the downtown area. Not the nice ones, but it‚Äôs not shit. It‚Äôs beautiful in its own way.

It‚Äôs the kind of house I‚Äôve always dreamed of having.

I didn‚Äôt say to my dad or grandma or sister that Lilah was a guy. Lilah isn‚Äôt even gay, he‚Äôs just what you‚Äôd call a metrosexual. He‚Äôs straight and cis but gets mistaken for gay because he dresses in a certain fashion.

I‚Äôve never heard Lilah talk about romance or anything, he‚Äôs always thinking about art and design all the time. He‚Äôs the hardest working kid I know.

Milla was there already when I got there. Lilah has the cutest dog. And I‚Äôm not really even into dogs. She was so soft and small.

We stood around awkwardly in the kitchen until his parents left to go do something or another and then Lilah and Milla loosened up a lot.

We talked about art and school and shit like we usually do.

Eventually we went on a tour of the place. It was a crammed three story house. The stairs were super loud and creaky. His bedroom was small and his bed was a pullout couch. It‚Äôs well decorated totally to his style.

The entire attic area was painted white with plenty of natural light from a sliding glass door. The whole place was an art studio. There were paintbrushes on the floor. An empty bottle of vodka. Guitars and charcoal. Paint everywhere. It was a messy dream.

I felt like I had stepped into a real version of all the studios I‚Äôve ever imagined.

The sliding glass door was open and there was a small mat on the roof. Milla had already been there for a while it looked like. She had markers laid out all across the mat.

I stepped out onto it and I was fine until I looked around and realized I was three stories up and there was no railing. I started to feel my heart beat hard and fast so I stepped back inside.

Lilah mentioned possibly going somewhere or doing something, so I suggested we go to the art store. I don‚Äôt know why I did because I really didn‚Äôt have any money to spend.

But we did. We went out and hopped in his car and went to the store.

I bought a mini version of the sketchbook I currently have, and a couple pens and markers. Lilah bought like one pen. I realized I could use a student discount even though I‚Äôm a high schooler and I‚Äôve never been more shook.

I could have saved so much money over the years.

We left and went back to his house. We sat down in the living room and watched a documentary on Meow Wolf. The trippy art exhibition/funhouse in Santa Fe.

THE same Santa Fe that F wants to do a trip to. I mentioned that and Milla and Lilah realized they couldn‚Äôt go because they had to go to some concert.

I was fucking mad but I didn‚Äôt say anything.

F needs 10 people to make the trip work. Right now there‚Äôs like none.

I‚Äôm praying it works and if it doesn‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs going to be okay. I won‚Äôt get too upset.

But we watched the movie for an hour. Lilah sat on the other side of the couch. Milla sat in a chair on the other side of the couch facing the other wall.

After a while she was laying in it sideways and upside down with her head looking directly upside down and at me. I realized my shorts weren‚Äôt sticking to my thighs from that angle and were probably exposing my scars if she was looking.

I really didn‚Äôt think she saw anything though and I didn‚Äôt move. Eventually she got up and sat back normally.

Then grandma picked me back up again because Lilah had to leave to take Milla home. We drove past them on the way back. I took a picture of them and sent it to Milla.

I still cannot believe that happened. Never in a million years would I have expected dad to be okay with it. I didn‚Äôt tell him that Lilah wasn‚Äôt a girl but it doesn‚Äôt matter. He looks and sounds as gay as you‚Äôll get but he‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs closeted or anything.

And his house was totally what my dad would classify as the ‚Äúhood.‚Äù But it‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs just a really old area of downtown.

But he said yes! I feel like a total rebel. I love it.

After that grandma picked me up and we went to eat at the place I work. We went though the drive thru. My manager was the one who brought the food out to the car, but he didn‚Äôt know I was in the car. When he gave us the food I rolled the window down and said hi.

He looked confused like I scared him and he was like damn I was scared haha.

He asked if I was working tonight and I said no, but I was tomorrow.

Then my grandma took us home.

I played Minecraft for a little while and went to my room to just lie down.

I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôve never had this much socializing in one week ever. I actually have friends who want to do things with me and I‚Äôm kind of addicted.

After dinner we went to this new toy store that opened. It sells a lot of different things and we went because they moved locations and my dad was curious.

But when we got home I was absolutely dead. It was only 8:30 but I felt like I was going to die.

And I‚Äôm not done socializing yet! I‚Äôve got lunch with Alyssa tomorrow, work, and a party at these people from churches house at 7-9.

Damn I‚Äôm gonna die.

I have to spend all my spare time Sunday Monday and Tuesday being totally alone.

And I had planned on just listening to this podcast and falling asleep an hour ago but then I got a text from Milla.

She said,

‚Äúcan i talk to you about something serious?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like duh of course I‚Äôm always here for ya in my head. I figured she was going to tell me something about Lilah or the guy she‚Äôs been kind of dating.

Then she said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm kind of nervous about bringing this up, but i was really concerned when i noticed it and wanted to check in with you.‚Äù

And I LOST IT.

My heart froze and I had to put my phone down. I was paralyzed with fear because I knew exactly what she was going to say.

She did see. When we were in the living room at Lilahs house today. She saw my scars up my shorts.

I really regret her seeing. I know she‚Äôs completely trustworthy, but I just didn‚Äôt want her knowing. I don‚Äôt want her thinking worse of me.

But we talked about it very briefly and I said I was doing okay.

Things are fine, but I feel so weird.

Especially after talking to Aug about it last night. Now they both know. F knows. My sister vaguely knows but I threatened her not to talk about it to anyone.

So many people.

I didn‚Äôt tell Milla that F knows. I did tell Aug.

I just said a teacher knows. I kind of wish I would have said who, since we both have his class. But Lilah and Milla were talking about him today and were saying how I‚Äôm HIS student. The go to person for him. And I‚Äôm like yeah you‚Äôre right. But they weren‚Äôt being judgy at all.

They understand I worked to be close in his little world, just like they do with their passions and interests. It was really nice to know they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a total kiss ass.

Ugghhhhhh I just can‚Äôt believe she saw.

It‚Äôs one thing to know. Aug knows. He didn‚Äôt see.

Milla saw, she barely knows.

It was easy to talk to Aug because he understood. He deals with the same shit.

But Milla is so different.

Ugh. I‚Äôm a wreck. I‚Äôm trying to hold it together without crying and I just want to finish this damn diary entry and finish yesterday‚Äôs which I didn‚Äôt do hardly.

...

But the worst thing about this is, I have two friends who know. I told them both I‚Äôm doing a lot better and have stopped.

But I don‚Äôt want to stop. I crave it every day.

DAMN I SHOULDVE BOUGHT A FUCKING BLADE!!!! SHIT.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do, after my hair appointment I‚Äôll be flat broke until the 28th.

I wonder if I‚Äôll actually get my money back if I return those clothes or if they‚Äôll give my like coupons or something.

I really could use like 40$ back."

But now, they‚Äôre just gone.

I‚Äôve been pretty anxious lately.

I‚Äôve been finding it hard to focus.

During my lunch break, I went over to my housemate‚Äôs room to chat and get myself out of my own head.

We ended up talking about panic attacks, and what the right things are that we can do to help each other is when we‚Äôre having one.

It was really nice.

Now I don‚Äôt have to worry if I‚Äôm doing the right thing or not- I know exactly what to do for her.

And she‚Äôll be there to support me, too.

Then she let me bring my school stuff to study with her so I could focus better, since being alone for too long makes my thoughts (and heartbeat) race.

It‚Äôs been interesting for me to realize that I don‚Äôt actually like being alone.

I always thought I preferred to be by myself.

It turns out, I just needed to find the right people to be around.

I didn‚Äôt know you can let your guard down when you‚Äôre not alone. I thought you always have to hide yourself from others, so they don‚Äôt hurt you.

But I can be myself around my housemates.

I can let my guard down, and breathe.

We went down to the kitchen, and my other housemate was there, too.

All of us sat together in the kitchen studying quietly.

They even let me talk out loud while I was thinking. One of them even asked me to talk out loud again when I stopped to think in my head.

She said it was soothing to hear my voice in the background while she did other things.

Which is crazy, because I find it soothing to hear them in the background while I do other things.

With them there, I could relax.

I could focus.

And even though I have a midterm tomorrow (that I am *not* ready for, RIP), I was happy."

Woke up at 7, showered and played Minecraft until 9:00.

I waited upstairs half an hour for L to pick me up. We drove to the museum and talked. We sat in the coffee shop. She bought my hot coca even though I said I‚Äôd pay for it.

We talked about the youth group, upcoming camp, art and stuff.

We could have sat there a lot longer but we got up and decided to actually go look at art.

We moved through the contemporary section making comments and me sharing my very limited knowledge of some of the paintings.

I noticed things I hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

We finally got to the photography section and I wanted to stay forever. The prints were beautiful. Breathtaking. I thought we had another hour or two but she was like,

‚ÄúOh btw we‚Äôve gotta leave in 30 mins because I remembered I‚Äôd have lunch with someone.‚Äù

Go figure. So we zoomed through the rest of the photography, then I showed her some old impressionist artists and we stopped in the works on paper room.

There were the most BEAUTIFUL PRINTS. I‚Äôve never seen such beauty. Looking at those prints reminds me why I love printmaking so damn much.

I wanted to stay but we had to head out.

On the way to the car she asked me this really big question, how do you deal with art and nudity and such a worldly subculture while being a believer.

I told her it was hard. But that was a lie. I don‚Äôt even give two shits about my art and my beliefs. Maybe I should.

But I tried to explain that God made the human figure and our bodies and that being around nudity is highly personal. I said I would obviously never be okay with nudity in a sexual way in art, but things like that are highly personal.

It was a weird subject and I thought I made a good answer, it‚Äôs hard to write it out again.

... I was tired when writing this.

Long story short, went back home, messed around for a couple hours.

Went out to dinner with P and A.

Went to youth group.

Went home and had a mild crisis talking to Aug. It consisted of me crying on the concrete floor of the storage room in the basement and holding my stuffed animals from when I was a kid.

I talked to Aug and he made me feel a lot better. We talked about SH a bit.

And I slept well."

0,"19.06.19. My grandfather
My grandfather was in the holocaust.

My mom used to tell me stories about him.

He refused to ever talk about it.

But they both thought it was important I knew.

He had to sneak out and spend all night scouring the ground for cigarette butts to collect enough nicotine that he could sell it for food because the Nazis wouldn‚Äôt feed them.

I‚Äôve been told by those who knew him that he shared everything with the others in his camp.

He would always eat last, even though they were all starving the same.

He had to hear his friends‚Äô and family members‚Äô numbers called out, and watch them be lined up in front of a big hole in the ground and shot.

He had to watch them fall into a ditch full of dead bodies. Then, he had to watch more nameless corpses fall on top of them.

He had to share a bunk with fifteen men, because that was all the space they were given.

...But it wasn‚Äôt even that bad, because they were stripped naked and shaved bare and given no blankets in the middle of winter.

They needed to sleep in a pile for warmth, to survive.

He had to walk in pitch black darkness through a sewer drain for three days to escape.

When he reached the exit, the first thing he saw was the barrel of a Nazi‚Äôs gun staring him down between the eyes.

But that Nazi had never looked a Jew in the face before. He didn‚Äôt have the heart to kill my grandfather.

I guess he‚Äôd always just been able to look the other way before. He‚Äôd never had to see what he was doing.

It must be harder when you have to watch them die.

So he just sent my grandfather back through the sewer drain instead.

And my grandfather had to walk another three days in the dark, right back into Hell.

Jews don‚Äôt believe in Hell the way Christians do.

Jews know you don‚Äôt have to die to get there.

We know it‚Äôs really called Auschwitz.

My grandfather‚Äôs dead now.

Sometimes, I think of how ashamed he would be if he saw who I‚Äôve become.

If he saw how weak and pathetic I am.

Because he was really strong.

He survived something really, really bad.

And he never complained.

And he never let it stop him from moving on.

He had a good life, after the war ended and he escaped Poland.

I‚Äôve never been through anything that bad.

I‚Äôve never really been through anything at all.

I just made stuff up, because I‚Äôm pathetic.

He would hate me, if he knew me now.

I don‚Äôt know if Jews believe in Heaven.

But if he‚Äôs there, I hope he hasn‚Äôt been watching me too closely. I hope he hasn‚Äôt seen who I am.

I‚Äôve let him down."

**The Memories**


It's been a struggle being on ""summer vacation"" with no job lined up. I can honestly say the past year has been the hardest of my life.


Not only was I a new mom but, my work environment became extremely toxic. Me and one other coworker were badly taken advantage of, increasingly given impossible amounts of work to complete. While the other two team members got more surmountable workloads.


All part of the school district's latest paradigm shift that accompanied our campus becoming a 1:1 technology campus.


The digital materials Crystal and I created will be used by future teachers for generations and no one will ever know how much time and effort it took to create.

I'd been looking forward to summer because I just needed to get out.

But, without a new job lined up, summer brought little relief. Out of the frying pan, into the fryer, as I prepared for interviews at a different district.


I didn't get a summer vacation last year, either. I've had very little time to myself since I had my son last year. I've been constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY on duty. Not a single moment of rest. Always making lessons and online test materials or taking care of the baby.


I just...yearned and longed for a little bit of free time.


Previous summers I would take a ""nostalgia tour"" and spend some time visiting places that had once been significant to me. Visiting my past self, I suppose.


I usually like looking at the past from the vantage point of the future. I normally visit places that were somewhat stressful to me. Maybe I'm trying to give hope and comfort to my past self.


**The Dream**

Maybe five years ago I had a job, a really stressful job, right across from a church. I didn't know how to drive at the time. My husband would drop me off at work (super early) and pick me up from that church (super late) every day.


I'd wait either in that church or in a nearby fast food restaurant.


Both were awkward places for me to wait, because I'm a- not Christian and b- vegetarian, so there weren't many options for me in a fast food place.


I dreamt that I should visit that church. Like a Salmon returning home I kept longing to visit that part of town but I had one job interview after another (not complaining).


**Adam's Academy**


After applying to the other, massive, local school district, I got calls for interviews at several places both near and far. I applied for both science and art positions (both of which I am certified to teach). Mostly I've been trying to break out of English since the whole subject seemed to be going in a really stressful direction.


I interviewed at Adam's Academy and got called back to do an example lesson. They asked me to do a cross curricular Science-Art lesson.


My lesson took a lot of time to prepare and I was very nervous the day of but they absolutely LOVED it! Said I was an amazing teacher.


Adam's Academy was a bit of a commute but, it would be so worth it to finally teach art.


And I loved the principal. Looked her in the eye and told her that her school was my top choice.


**C. Darwin Elementary**


The day after my Adam's Academy lesson demonstration, I went to my interview for a science position at Darwin.


They could not find any record of having called me for an interview. They sort of acted like maybe I'd made up having been called for an interview as some sort of weird Art of the Deal esque strategy. They said they had no science interviews scheduled for that day but awkwardly offered to go ahead and interview me anyway.


I declined. Back in my car, I tracked down the phone number from the day I'd gotten the call.



**E. Darwin Middle**


""Thank you for calling Darwin Middle, if you know your party's extension, you may enter it now.""


Now it all made sense. I hung up my phone and considered just returning home in shame. It was about half an hour into my scheduled interview time. But for some reason, I called back and explained the situation.


""I'm sorry. Apparently I've gone to the wrong Darwin. I understand if you don't want to interview me now, but I can still come in if you'd like.""


""...Please hold. ...Yes, come on in.""


So, I showed up to my interview about 45 minutes after the scheduled time. I was surprised to find that Darwin Middle was extremely close to my home. I must have passed it a million times and it was tucked just out of sight.


Trying to walk in from the parking lot, I realized I couldn't figure out where the front office was. I saw a man with a faculty badge and asked for his help.


He was headed up to the office and invited me to accompany him.


""Are you here for an interview?"" He asked. ""Yes, but it's already off to a bad start.""


""Oh? Are you late?"" he asked


""Not just late, I went to the wrong Darwin. So embarrassing.""


We continued to chat and that's when I first felt it. A sense of familiarity. This was my coworker, my friend. I felt it so strongly.


*Ah. So this is the story of the first time you met me. The infamous funny story of me going to the wrong Darwin.*


I walked into the school to see, unlike Darwin Elementary, Darwin Middle was adorned in theme colors that matched the dress I was wearing. I probably would have tried to play it up as intentional if I hadn't so obviously been confused my destination.


Waiting in the lobby I asked to use the restroom and as I passed the employee mail boxes I got this weird feeling. Like I saw an apparition of my future self strolling passed.


I apologized profusely for the mix-up. The interviewer was a good-natured science teacher who seemed to take the attitude of ""shit happens"" and didn't judge me too harshly (such an attitude could never have been found at my previous place of employ.)


The interview seemed to be going well. The science teacher was impressed with my answers and with my teaching portfolio (which I'd put a lot of time and money into creating at Office Depot).


When she heard about the work I'd been doing, the work Crystal and I had been doing, she acted like she thought it was insane. At this school district, curricula and lessons are already mostly created.


""Hey, I know you applied for a science position but... Would you be interested in teaching English again? The way we do it here is completely different from how it sounds like they did things at your old school.""


I came back two days later for an interview with a panel of teachers and specialists from the English department.


**The Phone Calls**

After the Darwin Middle interview I headed home. Maybe now, finally a moment to relax.


I began doing some laundry when the phone rang. With one laundry-detergent-contaminated hand aloft, I answered the phone.


It was the principal from Adam's Academy! She was calling to tell me that she'd been extremely impressed with me but would I be willing to take a science position instead of an art position?


I was a little deflated but told her I was interested. She asked me to sit tight and promised she planned on offering me a position today or tomorrow.


I hung up with her and went to go wash my hands. I'd barely applied the soap when my phone rang again.


The secretary at Darwin. I thought I must have forgotten something in the lobby. But, she said the principal was emailing me an offer right away.


Now I was in a conundrum. But it was short lived. I decided to do one more practice drive to Adam's Academy and didn't even get half way there before I decided...


Can't beat the commute to Darwin. Accepted the offer and sent a contrite email to the Adam's Academy principal.


Finally safe. Can finally rest.


**Nostalgia Tour 2019**


Next day...


Visited that church. And the fast food place.


In the restaurant the 17 or 18 year old kid behind the counter asked me ""Are you a teacher?"" ""Yes! How did you know!?"" I asked.


He just stared at me and blinked with angsty teenage sardonicism. ""Do I look like a teacher?"" I asked.


""Yeah."" He said.
He asked me what school I taught at. It was a relief to be able to name one.


At the church I prayed that the Adam's Academy principal would forgive me and find a better candidate.


When I returned home, I had a nice email from her saying that she understood my decision and wished me the best.

Hoping to visit more past places before the summer's out. It feels...deeply relaxing, mesmerizing. Surreal. Threading my future and past together on a string. Leaving future selves for my past self to cross paths with."

Hello. Today is definitely better than yesterday. I studied English a little, I was preparing for the exam and fixed a bug in the program. Still not the maximum of what I am capable of but better than yesterday.

Probably worth coming up with a plan for tomorrow. I want will read next chapter in the English textbook, will write a simple parser that will be able to read linear equation systems, also need to improve the class of linear equation systems now it does not take into account if the system is not compatible, also continue to prepare for exams. I think that's all."

I told him about my self harm.

Just a quick reply to his insta story.

I always knew he dealt with self harm, but I didn‚Äôt know when and to what extent.

I told him I was there if he ever needed to talk to someone who understands. And I told him that I‚Äôd been dealing with self harm badly for a while now.

Didn‚Äôt say where when what how why.

He said he appreciated it, and that he wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone.

Now he knows my secret.

Little Aug.

I want to protect him but I just don‚Äôt know how and I‚Äôm not close enough. We don‚Äôt come from the same walks of life.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to deal with gender and body dysmorphia like he has.

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be gay or trans.

But I want him to do good in life. It‚Äôs this weird instinct. I look up to him for being so brave, and he looks up to me, well, maybe because I‚Äôm older and giving him attention.

I don‚Äôt think his self harm was ever really bad. He‚Äôs posted pictures of his DIY stick and poke tattoos he does over some of the scars. They‚Äôre pale a white, old.

There probably aren‚Äôt many scars‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean he hasn‚Äôt hurt as much.

There are so many scars on me. Scars on top of scars on top of scars.

I still have hope they‚Äôll fade. But I don‚Äôt have hope I‚Äôll ever stop any time soon.

I don‚Äôt have any blades. I found a pair of scissors from a manicure kit and drew some blood with them.

The rubber band shit just makes my wrist swell up for some unexplained reason.

I feel so alone.

I know I can always turn to people online.

But for once in my life, I‚Äôd like to talk to someone about it face to face. With my voice.
My shitty, unreliable voice that never says what I want it to. I just want to talk. For real.

I wish I had more confidence.

But if I had more confidence I wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.

When I feel confident enough to tell someone, I also feel confident that I can stop by myself, so I never tell anyone.

I‚Äôm a failure.

I made SOME progress this year. At least F knows. At least I got that far. At least F knows that my mom died.

But he‚Äôll never know to what extent I struggle. No one ever will. Not my own family. Not any friend.

Not even strangers who read these dumb entries.

I want to write and make art.

That‚Äôll ever be the only way I can capture what I feel. Or at least do it justice.

I just need to be good at it first.

But that takes time. And I hurt NOW.

Fuck."
0,"18.06.19. Feeling good
I didn‚Äôt smoke weed last night!!

I was going to, because I felt like shit. I packed a bowl, got everything ready, even put my shoes on.

Then I looked at myself.

It was a Monday night.

And I remembered what I wrote a few days ago about feeling my feelings.

And I thought: *I could numb myself out.*

But then I kept thinking.

I wasn‚Äôt having flashbacks or nightmares.

I wasn‚Äôt having a panic attack.

I wasn‚Äôt feeling anything so strong I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

So I figured, *Why not just try to sleep this off?*

So I did.

I wrote out all my sadness, felt all my hurt, put on a soothing podcast, and let all the shit just drain out until there was nothing left.

And then, I slept through the whole night!

No nightmares.

No restlessness or waking up.

I just slept, and rested, and recovered.

And then, something else happened that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.

I used to think no one would ever be nice to be if they didn‚Äôt want something from me. That I‚Äôm only worth as much as I can give.

And yesterday, I had nothing left to give.

I was overcome with pain, and when I let that drain out, I was left completely empty.

But I still woke up to nice, supportive messages from kind strangers who didn‚Äôt want to see me suffer.

And my real-life friends told me they wouldn‚Äôt leave me either, even though I‚Äôm a total nut job.

And my math tutor even invited me to dinner tonight, to meet his wife and cat.

(We‚Äôve become friends. It‚Äôs not *that* weird.)

And I realized people like me, even though I don‚Äôt know why.

They want me there, even when I have nothing to give.

And I realized I‚Äôm not alone.

When I‚Äôm empty, there are other people who will fill me back up.

I thought I could never let myself break, because no one would be there to put the pieces back together.

But I was wrong.

Now, I know I can get through this.

And maybe, *just maybe*, everything really will be ok.

...Today, at least, it feels true.

I‚Äôve been telling myself that for ages.

Now, I can finally believe it.

I got 100% on both my practise tests. I might even pass my midterm this week!

And I officially started my volunteer position at the animal shelter yesterday. I got through training.

I‚Äôm officially a Cat Cuddler!

(But I‚Äôm allowed to cuddle all the animals that need socializing. Which is even better!)

I‚Äôve learned a lot this past little while.

I‚Äôm smarter than I think.

I‚Äôm stronger than I seem.

And best of all, I‚Äôm not alone.

I‚Äôve always loved people even when they won‚Äôt love me back. I treat them the way I wish they would treat me.

Because I know what it feels like to be hurt.

I know how bad people are capable of being.

For a long time, it felt like the world was full of only darkness. I assumed everyone would hurt you if you didn‚Äôt give them a reason not to.

I didn‚Äôt want to live in a world where everyone was bad.

But everyone else‚Äôs actions are out of my control.

People will hurt me if they want to, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.

The only way to guarantee to myself that there‚Äôs at least one person who doesn‚Äôt like hurting people is to *be* that person, and hope I find others like me.

So I‚Äôve always tried to be good to others, and do my best to bring out the good in them.

Even when they were bad to me.

...Even when I was bad to myself.

I was good to them.

Or at least, I‚Äôve tried my best to be.

It‚Äôs the only way I can think of to deal with the pain.

Sometimes, being good is the only way to prove to myself that not everyone is bad.

Even when I hate myself for it, for being such a pushover.

Even when I wish they would get a taste of their own medicine, just once, so they could see what it‚Äôs like.

I don‚Äôt want to be the one who gives it to them.

And that helps, to a certain point.

It eases some of the guilt from all my past mistakes.

And it‚Äôs nice to see the people you care about do well.

But it could also get lonely.

Because no one ever cared how I was doing.

I always wondered how long I could keep loving others without them loving me.

I wondered if I was even doing it right.

How could I know how I was actually making them feel, if I‚Äôve never felt it myself?

What if I was hurting them without realizing, and that‚Äôs why they were so awful to me?

...Maybe I was actually a bad person, and that‚Äôs why no one cared about me.

But all I know how to do is keep trying.

I wanted to be good.

At the very least, I wanted to be better.

And trying is better than not trying, even if you‚Äôre bad.

So even though I felt like a failure, I had to keep trying.

But my mind always spun with questions I didn‚Äôt know how to answer.

How many times could I open my heart to others, only to have them rip it right out of my chest?

How many hits could I take, without getting to heal?

What‚Äôs the point of trying to break the cycle if nothing ever changes?

Why do people always still just want to hurt me, no matter what I do?

Sometimes, the questions won.

It made me want to close myself off completely.

And I would give up.

It‚Äôs easier to be alone than constantly beat down.

But I‚Äôve never been able to stop trying for very long.

I can‚Äôt help myself.

I love people.

Even when they don‚Äôt love me.

It makes me happy to see them happy.

And I like being able to help them feel that joy.

I like getting to see their face light up with a smile.

I like getting to see their chest puff out with pride, or their eyes illuminate with passion.

I like getting to see them act like themselves, once they realize I really do like them as they are. People are so fascinating when they start being themselves.

Even if it makes me feel like a pathetic loser so desperate for human connection that I‚Äôll keep letting them hurt me forever.

I‚Äôll still keep doing it.

I don‚Äôt know how to stop.

Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt know that I want to.

I‚Äôd rather be pathetic than hurt people.

Even if it means I just keep getting hurt.

But today, I learned that not everyone just wants to hurt me, even when I think they do.

Today, I learned that it‚Äôs worth it to keep trying.

And I‚Äôm so grateful that I never stopped loving.

Because now, I finally get to feel it, too.

People love me back.

Not all people.

But it only takes one.

And, can you believe it?

I have more than one!"

I wrote a whole entry and deleted it. It was inconsistent and weird.

I went through a roller coaster of a day.

First I woke up and felt worthless because I didn‚Äôt have any ideas for my drawing to etch.

Then I watched this movie that made me cry a shit ton about this girl dying from cancer. It was an awfully directed movie but the story and writing made me cry.

It took me a while to recover after that. I was mad about how I didn‚Äôt get to experience death like the movies. I didn‚Äôt get to hold a dying hand in a hospital. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to watch the life leave them. I never REALLY knew what happened. I didn‚Äôt get a grave to visit and cry over.

It was all not fair. I never even got to say goodbye. Not an I love you. Just fucking nothing.  Maybe that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt been able to really heal. I‚Äôm bitter.

Well enough of me talking about mom for the hundredth time.

I recovered and did some other stuff. Made lunch, watched more tv. Played Minecraft. Usual time killing shit.

I decided I wouldn‚Äôt make some rushed drawing and bring it to school tomorrow to etch. I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself more than I want to see F.

And that was a huge step I think for me. I put what was best for me over my desire to see/talk to F.

I can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs been many if any times I‚Äôve done that this year. I need to take care of my self image sometimes.

At 7 there was a thing at our small group leaders house with all the junior/senior girls. On the way there, we go the same route as F and I did when we drove to the other high school to hang up art for the district show after school that day in April?? May? Idk. I think it was May.

I almost started crying. I really owe a lot to him. I feel like nothing ever changes. I say the same things over and over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù And ‚ÄúThank you so so so much.‚Äù

And you know what? He‚Äôs not perfect, no one is. And that‚Äôs okay!

I‚Äôm worried about next year. It‚Äôs going to be very different. But I hope it‚Äôs a dynamic year like this last one. I feel like things got so much better.

Anyways, next year aside, I‚Äôm here and NOW.

I just gotta make it through each day. I‚Äôm happiest when I can make others happy, I need to start being that person again.

I texted Petra and told her how much I care about her and how thankful I am for our friendship.

We have this semi serious joke that we‚Äôll grow old together as roommates forever living the single life. Men are overrated.

And we‚Äôre both kind of dead serious. I can‚Äôt believe someone actually appreciates my friendship enough to want to live with me.

I always complain about not having a ‚Äúbest friend.‚Äù I have a lot of potential candidates, I just need to put my part into the friendship.

I‚Äôm really lucky to have people. I just wish I had someone I could tell almost everything to. Someone I could be serious with, etc.

Oh, and while I was at the thing at Alyssa‚Äôs house, F texted me to tell me he couldn‚Äôt make it to school this week because he had stuff to do because he was leaving town on Thursday. He said he‚Äôd be back next week though.

I said it was totally fine because I was just about to text him and say I was busy this week and couldn‚Äôt make it.

He said he was glad I wasn‚Äôt disappointed, and that hopefully it would work next week.

I should have told him I was gonna be gone for the next four weeks, but Oh well.

If he tells me later this week/early next week that he‚Äôs going to be at school, I‚Äôll just tell him that then.

I was reading about teachers vs mentors in this book I was reading about art. F is somewhere in the middle for me.

First and foremost, he is my teacher, but all those in between times he‚Äôs been a mentor to me.

Not a mentor as an apprentice is to a master, but more like a student and a role model. It‚Äôs so hard to explain. I wonder if he thinks about me and a mentoree (if that‚Äôs even a word.)

I know I‚Äôm one of his more favorite students, but saying favorite might be pushing it. I know I‚Äôm his most reliable for most things, but I don‚Äôt know about favorite.

I wonder if he‚Äôs scared of me. I do tend to be more emotionally open around him, and let a lot of dark stuff out.

But he can appreciate that sometimes and not think of me as weird. Like that poem I made in the fall semester. ‚ÄúHow to Brainwash the Feeble.‚Äù He thought the poem was really awesome, and he doesn‚Äôt even like poetry that much.

I remember him being genuinely interested in it and asking me questions about it and saying that he didn‚Äôt know I had a talent for writing.

I was amazed.

Maybe I should write more.

It‚Äôs hell of a lot easier than drawing.

I think I‚Äôll make a book. Maybe.

A short book of poems and prints.

OOOOOO
SHIT MAN

That‚Äôs a good idea!!!!!

But I don‚Äôt know if I can top that one poem.

I am proud of the one I wrote recently, but it‚Äôs kind of about him and I can‚Äôt let him read that.

I like this idea. Poems and Prints. A book by me.

I‚Äôll probably call it something else though. Something more serious.

I‚Äôm so excited.

I wish I had someone who loved me unconditionally.

Or even just liked me unconditionally.

But no one does.

Not even if I pay for it - even my therapist ghosted me.

I wish she hadn‚Äôt.

And I wish I had someone to talk to.

Someone who would always be there.

Someone who cared.

But no one cares about me.

I can‚Äôt say I blame them.

I‚Äôm hard to love.

I don‚Äôt have many strengths.

And I have a *lot* of weaknesses.

But I wish someone loved me anyways.

I wish I didn‚Äôt have to get better.

I wish I was already good enough."
0,"Hi! Day 1
Hello! I'm student from Russia. I study in college as a programmer. As my hobby I study C++ and English. I think my English level is about A2. Also I like read book, manga and ranobe, watch films, TV series and anime. I'm bad at communicating with people.

About ganers. I don't like violence, dismemberment and blood, but if it's book I can read that (if there's a bit of it). For example I could not watch the first series of Goblin Slayer, but read manga. I like works that makes me think, but often I look for something lighter like comedy and romance, for example Love is War and Senryuu Girl.

For improve my C++ skill I read math book and implement things from there. I just started and implemented solving linear equations through a matrix, but it works wrong. Need a fix.  Also I think to work on MUD.

Why do I want to keep this diary. I think daily reports will help me to better manage my time and more often study programming and English and not watch TV shows or just waste my time on YouTube.

About today. Today did very little useful. I didn‚Äôt study English or C++, I didn‚Äôt prepare for exams(I have one on June 25 and the second on 27!), I just did ""homework"" (not sure about the correct use of the word) for the college, but I still have to do a report for it, and I didn‚Äôt do it either (I need to do this to 21!).It's a very bad day because of me."
0,"16.06.19. I‚Äôve made a horrible mistake
Back in the day, I was a pretty proficient Tinder-er.

Fastest I ever got from match to mattress was right around 15 minutes.

And I used to fuck a new guy almost every night. It was almost like a bedtime ritual for me.

Get in bed, get on tinder, get a match, get over there, get fucked, then get out before they can find a reason for me to stay the night.

Then I‚Äôd shower away my sins when I got back to my dorm, and fall right asleep.

I never fucked the same guy twice, no matter how many times they texted.

So... I‚Äôve ghosted a *lot* of people.

I‚Äôm not proud of it.

But I always got so worried about what they would say or do if I directly rejected them.

I always thought if I told them ‚Äúno,‚Äù that would make them angry, and then they‚Äôd just take what the wanted by force.

I‚Äôd rather have regretful sex because I couldn‚Äôt say no than get raped because I did. At least then it would be my own choice.

In the end, I got both.

But before that, I didn‚Äôt know how to say no to people.

So when I lost interest, I would treat those boys the way I treated any other problem in my life: ignore it ‚Äòtil it goes away.

I felt pretty bad about it.

But admitting I didn‚Äôt want them anymore felt worse.

So I ghosted.

Then, I got a taste of my own medicine.

My therapist ghosted me.

And it made me feel like fucking garbage.

To All The Boys I‚Äôve Fucked Before:

...Sorry.

(I‚Äôve never loved a boy. But I liked that movie!)

I‚Äôm not gonna hunt down all the guys I‚Äôve ever ghosted and pour my heart out to them about how my shitty past made me do fucked up things.

Not all of them deserve it.

Plenty of them did fucked up things, too.

And honestly, some of them I just don‚Äôt respect enough to bother texting again.

But there‚Äôs a couple boys I‚Äôve reached out and apologized to. They usually take it well.

...So there‚Äôs this guy.

I met him on Tinder last year.

We went on two dates.

The first one was the stuff of fairytales. I honestly can‚Äôt believe it even happened.

He picked me up, and wanted to take me to this secluded hiking trail by the water.

But I knew that was how girls get murdered.

...So I told him that, and he took me somewhere public instead.

We got coffee.

And then we finished getting coffee.

But I was having a pretty good time. So I let him take me to the woods.

For a while, we just walked around in nature, talking and getting to know each other.

We found a hole in the fence and cut under it to climb down the rocks so we could sit by the lake shore.

Then we stayed there, just enjoying each other‚Äôs company while the sun set over the water‚Äôs horizon.

That‚Äôs when I realized I was alone with a strange man in the woods after dark.

Not even on an official path!

I panicked.

So he took my hand, and said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll protect you from the murderers.‚Äù

What a sweet idiot.

He didn‚Äôt even realize it was him I was afraid of.

But I had no choice, so I grabbed his hand and let him hold me close as we walked back through the shadows.

He thought it was cute how jumpy and nervous I was.

I thought it was cute how he hadn‚Äôt raped me yet.

By the time we made it back to the car, I knew I could trust him. If he was gonna do anything, he would have done it in the forest.

So when he drove me home, and he actually got out of his car to open the door for me, I leaned up against the hood and said, ‚ÄúThanks for tonight. I had fun.‚Äù

And he said, ‚ÄúSo did I.‚Äù

Then I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in.

He was a good kisser.

But on the second date, he took me back to his motel to watch a movie.

And when he got hard and climbed on top of me and tried to take my shirt off, I freaked out.

I managed to hold myself together until I left.

But I never texted him again.

And once my therapist stopped responding to me, I realized how awful I must have made him feel.

Especially because I *specifically* told him I wouldn‚Äôt ghost. I said it was rude, and I wouldn‚Äôt do that to him.

So yesterday, I sent him a text to apologize.

And we started talking.

And then today, *he asked me out!*

And *I said yes!*

What the fuck did I just do?

I haven‚Äôt been on a date since that guy pulled a knife on me and I finally deleted my Tinder account.

I haven‚Äôt had sex in almost a year.

I haven‚Äôt had sex without also having a panic attack in even longer.

And I haven‚Äôt worked through any of my shit.

The assessment lady said I have ‚Äúattachment issues‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm qualified to date.

Am I just gonna hurt this boy, again?

...Is he gonna hurt me?

I shouldn‚Äôt have said yes.

But I‚Äôm just so fucking sick of being broken.

I want to be normal.

And normal 19 year olds go on dates.

Normal 19 year olds have boyfriends.

Normal 19 year olds fall in love.

Normal 19 year olds don‚Äôt feel too disgusting to be touched by another person.

So when he said he‚Äôd like to see me again, I didn‚Äôt let myself recoil in fear and tell him ‚Äúno‚Äù.

I used every excuse I could think of to scare him off.

I told him I haven‚Äôt been on a date since last October.

He said he hasn‚Äôt, either.

I told him I‚Äôve gained weight since the last time he saw me.

He said he didn‚Äôt care, he just liked my personality.

I told him I was raped, and that we would need to take things slowly.

He said he‚Äôll always stop when I say ‚Äústop‚Äù.

I asked him out on the spot.

We‚Äôre getting coffee next week."

I don't know. I think I am the problem. I get bored too easily. Maybe it's me not putting enough effort in?

He's not that bad of a guy. He is an amazing dad, he's helped me with so much. But I don't know.

Maybe we fell out of love? Maybe we were never in it.

Love is a feeling that I really don't want to experience.

Yeah yeah yeah everyone gets their heart broke and blah blah blah. But seriously. I'll like/love someone but it's never the way I see other people feeling it.
It's so much easier not feeling anything at all.
That's why I am always there for everyone.
Their problems first and hopefully I'll forget mine.

I'm okay. I promise. I'll always always always be okay."
0,"16.06.19. Father‚Äôs Day
It‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day today, which means I watched the kids while my dad watched basketball.

Seeing them makes my heart hurt.

It‚Äôs the little things.

Like when someone grabbed the two year old and started tickling him and didn‚Äôt stop when he said, ‚ÄúNo! Stop!‚Äù

...But that‚Äôs a personal one.

When I was molested, it started with tickling.

He didn‚Äôt stop then, either.

I know that‚Äôs not what was happening to the baby. But I always have to stop myself from puking when I watch it happen. Even writing about it now makes it hard to breathe.

Why don‚Äôt adults ever stop?

There were other things, too.

Like when the four year old casually mentioned she hadn‚Äôt eaten yet today. It was 3pm.

I asked one of the adults to feed her.

She responded: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Like when the seven year old asked why I wanted to give her a hug. Usually no one does.

I gave her so many hugs today.

Like when the eight year old was told by the adults to stop complaining about her tummy hurting, instead of being looked after.

I kissed it better for her.

That was all she wanted.

Like when the eleven year old got so excited that I *wanted* to listen to him talk about his interests.

When the thirteen year old swelled with pride when I asked to see the photography she put on Instagram.

When the fourteen year old was so grateful that I ate dinner and watched TV with him.

When the seventeen year old stayed in my room until 3am telling me why she can‚Äôt sleep at night.

When my mom came into my room to berate me because she stepped on something and hurt her foot.

...She‚Äôs gotten better since our fight, though.

She only yelled for 30 seconds before she stopped herself and left.

It‚Äôs confusing, because we‚Äôre happy.

No one‚Äôs really in danger.

No one‚Äôs actually starving or in dire need of medical attention or any other kind of attention.

We‚Äôre looked after.

There‚Äôs just a certain disinterest in our well-being.

You can hear it in the way my dad mindlessly says, ‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù when the kids try to talk to him.

You can see it in the way no one watches when they run outside. The older ones just watch the younger ones, and everyone trusts each other to stay on the property.

You can even see it in how the dog lights up when I pet him. Usually everyone just ignores him.

How the cat has started biting more since I left, and shies away from being pet now.

It makes me sad, because there‚Äôs nothing I can do except love them as much as I can and hope it‚Äôs enough.

Our home is the best place for them. CPS wouldn‚Äôt do anything except disturb us and anger the adults.

Social workers never get that, though.

They just think I‚Äôm a bad person for refusing to tell them the details I know they would report.

But if I‚Äôm the bad guy, then so be it.

What they want to do is worse.

They don‚Äôt really care about doing what‚Äôs best.

They just care about following procedure, no matter what that means for us.

Sometimes, I still wish I could tell someone. Just to bounce my stories off of, to see if they‚Äôre even bad.

But there‚Äôs no one.

The seven year old is going to camp for a month.

She asked me to send her letters.

Last year, no one sent her any."

I‚Äôm a new father and have an amazing wife and one year old son but I feel so empty right now. I miss my friends. I miss my mom. I resent my father. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. It‚Äôs been that way for far too long. I have no desire to do things I used to. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I miss my mom so much. There‚Äôs too much old pain inside. The abuse I took from relatives as a child. The ridiculing and bullying during school. The lack of direction and focus I‚Äôve had since my mom passed just won‚Äôt go away. I love my son. I love my wife. I haven‚Äôt been the same me that she signed up to spend the rest of her life with. I feel like I‚Äôve let her down by not being able to overcome my issues but for some reason I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to her. I used to tell myself that everything would end up ok because I had been through so much that I was too strong to be brought down. Now I feel like the weight of everything is becoming to much for me. I feel exhausted all the time. I feel alone. I feel withdrawn and depressed. I‚Äôve been battling depression for years and it always seems to come back around any holiday. Mother‚Äôs Day reminds me of my mom and how much I miss her. Christmas reminds me of the family that I had that doesn‚Äôt speak to each other anymore. Father‚Äôs Day just reminds me that I‚Äôm not loved by my father and that I have nobody to look to for help. Nobody to turn to when things get tough. I know I can talk to my wife but she has so much on her plate already that I feel bad bringing my past shit back around because we‚Äôve gone over it so many damn times. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Am I ever going to be happy and myself again? What happened to all my friends? My best friend is now homeless and a drug addict. My older brother that I looked up to for so long won‚Äôt talk to me anymore because I stopped answering his drunken phone calls at 2 am. Now he‚Äôs moved back to Ohio and I feel like we may never be brothers again in this life  like we used to. I miss my sister. Sometimes I feel like running and being by myself but I can‚Äôt because I love my son and would never do to him what my father did to me which is abandon me. I‚Äôm unhappy but I can‚Äôt give up. I feel like all I do is work then come home and hangout with the baby then go back to work again. I have no hobbies. I have no passion. I have no dreams. I have what I have and I‚Äôm grateful for it, but it‚Äôs simply not enough right now to overcome my past and all that pain. I feel like it hurts too much to look at the past but I‚Äôve been through too much to let go of it. It‚Äôs a part of me. It‚Äôs how I became what I am. How can I let go of the pain if its who I am? How can I become a better person? How can I find my old passion, my old dreams, my joy in life again? I always find ways to fuck things up that are good for me. Like I‚Äôm so used to suffering that I don‚Äôt know or even want to live without it. I see people all together with their family and I think that I can bring that to my life if I keep trying, but what to do till then? My lack of desire and energy has had an affect on my relationships to the point that I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre all just gonna fall apart. They always seem to. I literally have no real friends left that are within 1000 miles of where I live. Nobody seems to ask me to do anything anymore. Am I that bad that nobody has any interest in being my friend? Can they see the pain in me and just would rather not deal with it? Is it because I‚Äôm too withdrawn? Even at work where I have people I supervise they don‚Äôt seem to care much about me. I feel insignificant and lost. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore or remember who I wanted to be and how to become that person. I‚Äôm truly lost and lonely. My son brings me the only joy I find in life anymore. The only things I look forward to are what he‚Äôs gonna do with his life. I want to be the father he deserves. I want to be the husband she deserves. I want to become the person I deserve to be. I just don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Nobody seems to take me seriously anymore and I‚Äôm afraid my son will see it. I‚Äôm afraid he won‚Äôt look up to me when he gets older. That he‚Äôll see me as a failure and a bum. That I‚Äôm just another boring old dad with no dreams, no ambition and no fun to be around. I‚Äôm more afraid of that than anything. But how do I turn things around when I have no direction nor do I have the energy to accomplish anything I do set my mind to? I don‚Äôt feel whole. I feel like a shell. Like I‚Äôm just going through the motions of life waiting for the end. I need help. I need someone to talk to. I need to have some release of all this. I haven‚Äôt had real fun in years.

0,"Slightly over 1 year since I became a ""real"" adult
I haven't posted here in a while. Honestly, I'm choosing to post here because I went through my subs trying to figure out which one would be best for what I have to way, and it was either this one or r/casualconversation, and the thought of posting there just gave me anxiety because I worried that maybe 50+ people would respond and I think I'd feel obligated to reply to a certain number of them or something, and I've been getting into an increasingly internet-quiet/typing-quiet mood over the past year.

Anywho.. It just occurred to me that I feel like it's crazy that we spend our whole childhood supposedly preparing for adulthood, but I've been here for a whole year now and I feel like I'm still going ""The hell is this?"", ""The hell is that?"", and ""That is not at all what I thought it was.""

And I know I'm far more prepared than a lot of people at this time. I have money management skills and a college education, a job, and some home economics know how. Beyond that though, I've been starting from scratch.

It took the whole year, but I *think* I just about understand how romantic relationships are supposed to work.

At the moment, I feel like the most unfortunate thing is that I explicitly remember my parents mentioning when I was a child that it was weird to stay friends with people from high school or college after the fact. But here I am, post-college realizing that the ability to meet people once you're no longer in school drastically decreases because you're no longer forced to go to a place that has hundreds of people who are your own age every day. So it probably would have been beneficial to have picked up a few more friends or to have had some better friendships during high school and college so that I would have been inclined to make them a bigger part of my life now. It wouldn't have been weird or inappropriate like they said, it would have been a fantastic idea. *rolls eyes*

Unrelated to that, I keep feeling like my brain is too tired for everything I want to do, and I find that particularly annoying.

I feel like there's a super long list of stuff that I got wrong as I was growing up that I want to remember to tell my children one day, but I'm really worried that I'm going to forget it all, so I'm going to have to write it down. But this is one of those things. I do want my kids to take their education very seriously, almost as seriously as I did, but friends are so important. Being friends with specific people who dress a certain way isnt important and being friends with everyone isnt important but have somewhere between one and a few really close friends is really important."

It‚Äôs so late. I need to get off the fucking toilet and shower.

The clothes I ordered came in the mail today while I was at work. When I got home and opened it the first thing that fell out of the big white bag was the blue dress.

God that dress, it‚Äôs slightly different in person but not too noticeable. It‚Äôs the perfect length, and fits me pretty good for being a fat ugly bitch.

If curl my hair and put on my new sandals, I‚Äôll be the most beautiful I‚Äôve ever felt.

Everything else I ordered fit except for two pairs of shorts. I got the wrong style on accident. I‚Äôll have to return those sometime this week and order new shorts tomorrow.

I‚Äôm so happy!!!!

It sounds so materialistic of me, but I RARELY ever am able to find this many clothes that fit me and are cheap and comfortable.

I think I‚Äôll send the sweat shorts back. I‚Äôd rather spend the money on a better pair of black shorts.

I feel so good. Today was good.

I can‚Äôt wait to wear my dress to church. I hope the spaghetti straps won‚Äôt be an issue.

Maybe I‚Äôll wear a jacket."

I had a breakdown last night.

I was at home, though, so I couldn‚Äôt make any noise.

I couldn‚Äôt smoke any weed.

I couldn‚Äôt drink or cut or kill myself.

I couldn‚Äôt do any of the things I usually do when everything starts feeling like too much.

So I went on one of those free online counselling chat services, where you text someone anonymously.

I had no choice.

I had to do something.

And I knew I couldn‚Äôt do it myself.

I started off fairly calm and reasonable, just saying I needed help calming down.

But the counsellor didn‚Äôt get everything I was talking about, because I started my story in the middle.

So she asked me for some background info.

Why did I get diagnosed with PTSD?

Why did I need help with school?

Why couldn‚Äôt I talk to my parents about all this?

Why was I so upset tonight?

And I just fucking lost it.

I told her everything.

It started off kind of coherent, and then it quickly descended into one long emotional ramble.

I was a mess.

I don‚Äôt even know when I started crying. I didn‚Äôt even notice it until I tasted tears that had dripped down my face into my mouth.

It all just flowed out of me.

Tears, feelings, snot, pain, memories.

I sat on the floor in my dark bedroom for an hour.

(I had to keep the lights off so my family would think I was asleep and not bother me. They bought it, even though it was only 9pm.)

Everything hit me all at once.

And illuminated by the dim, lonely glow of my laptop screen, I fell apart.

I sat and I cried, because there was nothing else for me to do. There was no way for me to stop it.

So I poured out my soul to this random, apathetic stranger on the internet.

She barely said a word, and I ignored what little she did have to say.

(‚ÄúHave you tried picturing a calm ocean breeze?‚Äù)

(Fuck you, bitch.)

And when it was over, I didn‚Äôt feel any better.

I just felt drained.

But I had no tears left to cry.

And I was sick of sitting on the floor.

So I brushed myself off, put on my coziest pyjamas, grabbed a few soft stuffies, and went to sleep.

And today, when I woke up, I felt better.

I think I finally understand the point of talking about your feelings.

Terrible timing, since my therapist just ghosted me.

But I‚Äôm taking this as a new beginning.

...No, not a beginning.

The story would have to end for me to start a new one.

And I‚Äôm far from the end of this.

But I‚Äôm turning the page.

It‚Äôs a new chapter.

My demons will keep chasing me forever if I keep running. I‚Äôve always been so afraid of what will happen if I let them catch up to me.

But last night, I couldn‚Äôt run.

I couldn‚Äôt hide.

I thought if I ever stopped running, the demons would catch me and drag me down and destroy me.

But then I had no choice but to give in. So I let my demons overcome me and do what they wanted.

And something unexpected happened.

They had their way with me. They made me feel unbelievable pain, helplessness, despair.

But then, they let go.

And I was fine.

I thought you let go of the past by trying to escape it.

I thought facing my demons would be giving up.

I‚Äôve been running as fast as I can, trying not to let them win. Trying to be strong enough to always outrun them, to never let them get close enough to hurt me.

I thought they were too strong, and I‚Äôd have to run far enough that I could avoid them, so I wouldn‚Äôt lose.

I never thought I could fight back.

I just assumed there was no point.

I thought they would break me in a second.

That wearing those wounds would be a failure on my part, for letting them hurt me.

I thought if they caught me, they would drag me down forever, and I would be stuck with all that pain.

But I wasn‚Äôt.

And they didn‚Äôt.

It turns out, they never really wanted to fight at all.

They were only chasing me because I‚Äôm *their* escape.

Once I let them out, they were free.

And so was I."

I dream of art camp.

It sounds cheesy to call it that, although that‚Äôs what it essentially is. A better name would be like, ‚Äúhigh intensity three week fully immersive college credit art course.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt call it by it‚Äôs name here. So for now, it‚Äôs ‚Äúart camp.‚Äù

Three short weeks doing some of my favorite things. I‚Äôll take Printmaking, where we‚Äôll dive into silkscreen, relief carving, lithography, intaglio, and more.

Life drawing where I‚Äôll do tons of drawings of still lives, live models, other people, sketches and doodles galore.

My mystery elective, which will probably be either photography or experimental painting. I hope I‚Äôll learn a lot from either of those. I don‚Äôt know what to expect.

Creative writing and art history! I‚Äôm not 100% sure on the art history though.

On top of that they have professional practice seminars and talks and will teach us practical ways to get into college.

I‚Äôm so excited. I can see myself sitting in the printmaking department at my own little table. Working away at some print or drawing.

I can see myself sitting alone in the grass against some building sketching or talking with people.

I can see myself sleeping at night wondering if my roommate is asleep.

It‚Äôll probably be totally different from what‚Äôs in my head though.

Oh but most importantly, I can see myself at the exhibition night on the last night. A small section of the white walls in the gallery space entirely devoted to my artwork. I can see myself nervously standing around in my blue dress. Wondering if I hung up my art the right way, wandering if my family will think my art is stupid. Waiting for someone I know to wander into the gallery. ‚Äî hoping it‚Äôs F.

I PRAY I won‚Äôt be socially awkward the first couple of days. I PRAY I make a good impression upon teachers and the adults there. I hope I make friends, not weird ones, but chill ones.

Ahhhh I‚Äôm so so excited I just had to gush a little.

I really want to impress people. Just a little."

I set a deadline for myself. Tuesday.

I texted F and asked if he would be at school any days next week. I need to get two plates beautifully etched before I go to camp.

I want an etching or so I can be really, truly proud of and in love with.

He said he‚Äôd be there Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday. But Wednesday I‚Äôm already going roller skating with P and A.

And Alyssa wants to get together. Fuck. I don‚Äôt have time for another breakdown like last time. I‚Äôll just lie. Tell her my bible reading has been good.

But that‚Äôll have to be Thursday or Friday.

I can‚Äôt do Monday because I need a day to draw my plates. And I need the weekend to come up with ideas.

... Wow I‚Äôm so busy.

I wish I weren‚Äôt. I wish I had one more week to relax, think, draw.

Camp is the 26th. I‚Äôll probably spend all of the 25th packing and working and being all excited.

I really wanted to get together with Lindsey like we had talked about. But that‚Äôll have to be in August if it works with her.

After church camp I have three days to rest/get ready for a family reunion and my 3 week art camp.

At the end of the art camp, there is an exhibition  where we get to show off a bit of the work we‚Äôve made at the camp.

Obviously I‚Äôll invite my parents, maybe grandparents, although I wish I didn‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôll invite F, I know he said he wants to come. Or at least he SAID that. I‚Äôm thinking about inviting Lindsey or Alyssa, it just depends.

I bought this beautiful dress from H&M. It hasn‚Äôt arrived yet, and I really, really hope it fits. It‚Äôs just beautiful in its own unique way. It looks like a cyanotype and I love it. [https://m2.hm.com/m/en_us/productpage.0744893005.html](https://m2.hm.com/m/en_us/productpage.0744893005.html)

...

I remembered I was also going to play D&D with the gang on Thursday night so I texted the group chat to see when and where and found out S was in a bad car accident and is in the ER.

There‚Äôs an awful bruise on her neck and a shit ton of glass went into her hand. I feel so bad for her. I want to cry. I know she‚Äôs tough as shit but I can‚Äôt imagine how scary that‚Äôd be. Her car is completely totaled.

So I don‚Äôt know if we will meet Thursday. Most likely not. But I‚Äôll leave the time open just in case.

Now I‚Äôm meeting with Alyssa Thursday morning.

Jesus fucking Christ what a week.

And I‚Äôm going to my grandparents on Sunday!

I didn‚Äôt even realize I had so much going on until I sat down to write this. I thought I had more time. Summer is going FAST. I really don‚Äôt have time to waste playing mine fucking craft.

My life is never this interesting.

For the first time in my life, I have a life.

And I could have done so much more if I wanted to. OH and Milla said that me, her and C should get together sometime this summer.

I just want to scream and run back to my introverted turtle shell.

The issue with me is I like the idea of friends, I just don‚Äôt like all the maintenance. If only I had like one or two close friends.

...

I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. I had so much I wanted to do before camp, and I have barely scratched the surface.

I need to return my library books.

I need to shop for bras.

I need to etch two plates.

I need to finish my charcoal Drawing.

I need to finish ‚ÄúThe View.‚Äù

I need to finish that other book by David Bales.

I need to finish them before Tuesday because I told F that I‚Äôd let him borrow it. I can probably get a lot of reading done in the car Sunday.

I need to clean my room.

I need to get my hair dyed. (24th)

I need to figure out which days I requested off because I forgot.

Read my fuckin bible so I have something to talk with Alyssa about.

AgHhhh and so much more I haven‚Äôt even remembered that I need to do.

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane.

I‚Äôm just going to cool down. Drink some water. Finish that podcast. Lay in bed.

0,"14.06.19. My worst nightmare
I barely slept last night, but around 5 or 6am I finally managed to fall asleep.

I had a nightmare.

My stomach is still in knots from it.

In it, I lost the little note inside my locket, the one my 7 year old cousin gave me.

The note she wrote that says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.

The one she asked me to keep in the locket and wear forever so she would always be in my heart, even when I had to leave.

The one she checks I‚Äôm still wearing every time she sees me.

She always gets so suspicious I‚Äôve lost it or taken it off. It crushes her to think I don‚Äôt really love her, or that I‚Äôve forgotten about it (and by extension, her) completely.

And she‚Äôs always happy when I show her I‚Äôm still wearing it and she sees that I still love her.

In the dream, I lost the note.

Outside, in the wet grass.

Everyone else who was there was busy enjoying themselves. They were having a scavenger hunt.

(It was a dream, ok? It had weird parts.)

But I refused to join.

I had to find the note.

But no matter how long or hard I searched, no matter how many false hopes when I found other slips of paper in the grass, I just couldn‚Äôt find it.

It was gone.

My mom came out and told me to stop looking.

She told me I was ruining the scavenger hunt for everyone else, to stop crying and go join them, that my cousin wouldn‚Äôt be that upset.

After all, she‚Äôs just a kid.

Kids don‚Äôt remember things.

Kids don‚Äôt get upset.

That‚Äôs what my mom said in the dream.

But all I could think was: *Don‚Äôt you care?*

I was sobbing on the grass.

I‚Äôd lost the most important thing I have.

It was going to hurt my cousin.

My mom didn‚Äôt care about any of that.

She just wanted me to stop ruining her good time.

When I wouldn‚Äôt stop crying and join her, my mom scoffed at me and left.

So I stayed where I was, endlessly, desperately searching for the note through my tear-stained vision, until my alarm went off.

When I woke up, I opened the locket.

The note was still nestled there, right in place.

But the terror still hasn‚Äôt faded.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had a nightmare I can‚Äôt wake up from.

I‚Äôve had dreams about all the worst things I can think of. And I can think of lots of awful things.

But this one was worse than all the others.

This one didn‚Äôt stop when I woke up.

My worst nightmare is hurting the kids."

Just going to ramble.

Recently it was my sister's birthday. I got her a 3ds game, Persona Q2, because she had been playing Persona 5 a lot on my PS4. I didn't have to get her anything since I told her that her bday present was to go see BTS in concert and I also paid for her friend's ticket. But... I still wanted to get her something. She likes it. :)

Also everyone in the house is sick except me. I don't think I could afford to get sick since I'm still recovering from surgery.

Speaking of surgery. I'm on week 4 since surgery. I can't eat too much because it will hurt my stomach, kind of like how someone feels when eating too much food. A bloated feeling, but for me it's actual pain. üòÖ I was just so hungry though... I only eat carbs in an emergency and there wasn't really anything healthy to eat.

Anywho, I got several packages today.

One was for my sis from my other sis for her bday, so I wrapped it up and gave it after singing happy birthday. My sis thanked me for wrapping it. I didn't expect the package, what a surprise and right on her birthday!

Another was a kpop trade - a few photocards. The person I traded with is so kind... I'm glad I got back in touch with her. üò¢ I kind of look up to her. I never really told her that since I don't want to have a relationship where one is on a pedestal, you know? But I'm happy she's still so nice to me and I can talk about merch with her.

The package I opened after that was for an out of print game I bought for the Vita. It was hard to find a copy that wasn't $55 so I checked Mercari and luckily found one about $48. I mean it's not that much cheaper but it was also domestic so I went for it. It's in English but was only released in Asia. I played it a little, it's been fun. I have the PS4 version but I prefer handheld games since I don't have to wear glasses like I do for my tv.

My last package was from my favorite group BTS. I bought 2 dvds - Love Yourself dvd New York and dvd Europe. I don't have the Seoul one... I also don't have the exhibition book. Anyway, I pulled Taehyung's photocard for New York and I thought it was hilarious because it was a closeup of his face. For Europe I pulled Jimin's photocard. It is so cute! I love the blue hair and his selfie game is strong. Definitely keeping it. I didn't even pull my bias's photocard but that's okay I guess. Ironically I always pull maknae line and hardly pull my own bias.

That's all for now. üôÇ"

I kept thinking back on what i wrote yesterday. I dont really regret it, though my grammar could be fixed and my sentence structure could be better.

Anyways

This whole moving situation is very stressful, my roommate is still moving and i still dont want tk go back to my grandma. Theres a lot of bad memories in that house, mostly pain. A lot of emotional pain really. My grandmotger has always been a strong woman, but it seems like the years as well as karma has caught up to her. She has many illnesses, the ones i know are high blood pressure, diabetes, knee replacement, obesity, depression, the discs in her spine are unaligned. She was a great mom, she made sure i was clean and always fed, but she was very abusive towards me. I think it's because she had a lot of emotions from her past coming out. My mom told me that when my grandmother was a kid she was blamed for one of her sisters catching fire. Her and her sister were playing in the attic/top room of her home in Mexico. Being that this was 50+years ago electric light bulbs weren't really a thing. She was playing with her sister in a blanket tent they made. My grandmother accidentally knocked over a candle, that fell on the blanket, which was ontop of her sister, and she was ablaze. Panicking they both screamed and the sister flailed about wrapping the blanket around herself. The adults came running at the sound of the girls shrieks, and managed to smother the flames. The worst part is that they unwrapped her in one pull of the melted blanket, skinning the little girl in front of everyone. They took her to the hospital, she had 3rd degree burns on over 70% of her body and she lived. Everyone blamed my grandmother. My grandmother carried that guilt with her all her life, influencing her in her later years into an abusive relationship with my grandfather. My grandfather doesnt talk much or at all about his childhood. He tells me he'd be badly beaten by his dad and his mom was a drunk...

I dont really wanna talk anymore, my friends are picking me up in a little bit. We're going to ignite, I just wanna forget about my problems for the night.

I decided to go on a walk. I brought my sketchbook just in case. I really didn‚Äôt come across people. I wanted to be alone, but my reasons for being alone were more fear driven than anything so I decided to face my fears and I didn‚Äôt turn on the street I usually do.

I kept walking down the busy road to the tiny shopping area. Down to the Starbucks.

I felt like every single car was watching me, and they probably were. I felt so paranoid. When I crossed the street I felt every pair of eyes on me. Judging me.

When I walked into Starbucks it felt oddly familiar. I used to come down to draw there in the evenings during the school year. I always see this one girl/guy who works there. I don‚Äôt know their name but they‚Äôre usually polite.

I ordered the smallest drink I could and sat outside on the patio. It was empty except for two older women chatting over coffee.

It was nice. Starbucks IS nice. I felt underdressed in my gray T-shirt and DIY jean shorts. I had no makeup on. I felt bare.

I started to draw and fucked up so I scribbled shit all over the page. I listened to the two women talk briefly. They started talking about another woman who was an art professor or something. One of the ladies said she used to do art but it gave her so much anxiety each time she would start something that she just quit.

I tried not to smile. I didn‚Äôt want them to realize I was listening.

This mother and her son sat down at a table. The son was reading this giant book on Caesar. The kid must‚Äôve been no older than 11 or 12.

Every once and a while he would stop reading and energetically tell his mom about something he read or some crazy fact.

His mom left for a while and the kid moved across from me to a different chair and kept reading.

I decided to do some quick gesture sketches of him and other people who were sitting there. After a while there were no people.

I saw a mother and her two daughters from church. They‚Äôre so old now. I remember being there at the court the day they were adopted. I even babysat for them once.

I shyly said hi and kept drawing. I waited till they left to go back in, order another drink, and I sat inside in the air conditioning.

I drew some more people then my drawings got worse and worse the more bored I got.

I decided to leave and I crossed the street.

On a whim I decided to open the gate and go into the small plot of graveyard fenced inside the middle of a giant parking lot. It was large enough to sit unseen by the passing traffic.

I sat down against a tree. The light danced across the unkept grass. I drew for a little while. I was trying to get over my fear of bugs. There weren‚Äôt a ton but I started to get pretty anxious so I got up and left when my pencil ran out of lead.

I walked fast home. This small group of middle school boys were 50 ft behind me following me down the sidewalk.

I was gone around 3 1/2 hours.

It was so nice to be away from my sister all afternoon.

I listened to a podcast or two. Read half of a book. Ate some pizza for lunch.

Overall it was a good day.

It‚Äôs not over.

But I felt so at peace in that little historical graveyard. A place where people were buried over a hundred years ago.

Headstones with people who have been dead longer than I‚Äôve been alive.

It was like this morbid community of death.

A place like this is where my mom was supposed to be. Where she should be.

Not ashes in an urn.

But I didn‚Äôt really think of death. I just was overwhelmed with the beauty of the place. How quiet and alone I was, yet surrounded by a busy street, and technically in the middle of a grocery store parking lot.

I should shower now. My sister said I stink.

She‚Äôs probably right. I don‚Äôt know if I put on deodorant this morning.

I did wash my face though.

I want to stay up late tonight if I can.

A group of my friends (and their friends) were hanging out in the kitchen.

They invited me to join, so I spent some time with them. I had a good time.

But then, like always, I got tired and wanted to leave.

So I went back upstairs to my room.

Not a minute later, I heard a knock and giggles.

I‚Äôll skip the details of what happened - it‚Äôs one of those things that‚Äôs such a collection of inside jokes that I can‚Äôt even explain exactly what it was.

When the joke was over, I went back to my room and my friends headed back downstairs.

And as we separated, my housemate casually said: ‚ÄúLove you!‚Äù

And I casually said back: ‚ÄúYeah, you too.‚Äù

It was so natural, I almost didn‚Äôt even notice what just happened.

It wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

It just *was*.

Even though I‚Äôm broken.

I can‚Äôt believe they love me back!"

I feel like life is slipping from me.

I don‚Äôt see the point of things anymore.

I got up early. Did my laundry, drank extra water, went on a walk,  showered and listened to a podcast. I did all the shit they say to do to get out of a funk.

And I still feel equally empty inside. I‚Äôm just clean. That‚Äôs all.

I tried to force myself to feel good, but it all seems so hopeless. I feel like things will never change. Or at least this sadness will never go.

I‚Äôll have it with me for the rest of my life. My sweet mother. I miss her so much. I say that every day but it‚Äôs fucking true.

I miss her every day. It‚Äôs been more than a year without her now. Tomorrow would have been her funeral.

That god damn funeral.

I thought I was SO strong.

But you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve got until it‚Äôs gone. And the longer she‚Äôs gone, the more it hurts.

I keep having urges but I need a new blade.

Mine is old and rusting. The tip broke and is no longer sharp like it once was.

I tried the fucking rubber band trick. Made my wrist swell up.

[This](https://prnt.sc/o15pvn) was from four snaps. My skin is weird as shit. Now it itches. I hate myself. I hate my body. I wish I were a ghost.

I could float around, fly through walls, and I wish I could read thoughts. Life would be so much more interesting.

If only it were that way.

I kinda don‚Äôt care about writing down the actually events that happened today. Or any day. I‚Äôm kind of done.

But I will because that‚Äôs why I started doing this in the first place. So no day of my life would be totally and completely lost or forgotten.

I woke up. Made some breakfast. Drank some water. Put my clothes in the wash. Went for a mile and a half walk. Listened to a 99% invisible podcast about this painting. Came home. Put another load in the wash. Ate lunch. Watched TV. Went to church. Came home.

My day was boring. I didn‚Äôt do anything meaningful today.

I wish I were dead.

Not because I‚Äôm bored.

Because I feel dead on the inside."

Have you heard of Sylvia Plath? I'm obsessed with her, especially her semi-autobiographical book 'The Bell Jar'. I feel like Esther, reading about Esther, how accomplished she is, how alone she feels. I'm not alone; I have incredible friends, loving parents, and a great boyfriend. I've somehow managed to achieve everything I wanted, and I'm working on what I wish to achieve. I'm privileged, and I'm an insufferable attention-seeker if I claim any kinship with Plath. I refuse to belittle her like that. But what am I trying to say through all these muddled words? I want to be left alone, and I don't want to be left alone. I know I should reply to texts, but I feel like an empty shell - nothing I say is of any consequence. I have my whole life laid out in front of me, like a noose that I can't undo. It's closing in on me, and all this love is suffocating me. What a selfish pig, what a drama queen. What do you do when you reach the point when can't trust your thoughts, your emotions? I just want to end it all, but even that is not in my control. That's the cruelest truth - there's no such thing as free will. Am I here writing this, or am I really cutting? Or is that my head splattered on the road? I don't know, my thoughts are too vivid and they scare me. I can't even bring myself to reply to my therapist. It's hilarious I'm stressing about letting her down.  My fingers are a mess. I've chewed and peeled my skin until they are red and raw. I can't wash dishes, and I'm positively howling if I have to squeeze a lemon. It's hilarious - I want the pain, but I also don't want it. Plus, people notice. I guess I'm going to have to bring gloves back into fashion. Maybe I could waltz in a blue gown and then kill myself. How poetic. And so dramatic. If anything, I'm at least consistent."

I dont really know how to start this off, maybe something will come of this, maybe I'll be famous. All I know is life has proven itself to be very difficult.
I am in actuality very sad and very lonely and maybe putting these words in an anonymous public forum will make me feel less lonely? Who knows.
 This all bullshit, i know what to put down on this keyboard its whether or not i will allow myself to express and finally admit my feelings. I'm very insecure and i think there might be something wrong with me, im not entirely sure. Im not sure of anything because im afraid of being attached to things  ecause thats when things are able to leave because nothing sticks around forever. I just think its a little funny how that seems to be the path and theme of my life sometimes. Its hypocrisy and abandonment.
 I hate when i see people succeed because deep down i know i can do what they do, I'm not stupid, I just have no motivation or confidence in myself. I know i have so much potential to do anything, but will I? Will i ever get off my ass and do something with it? Maybe. I thought i could if i found someone to believe in me, I thought it would be my girlfriend but that doesnt really seem to be working. I dont know how I feel. I met this girl off of Tinder, the 1st date of the dozens of people i tried to talk to. I took off with what i could and i think i regret it. I cant bring myself to let go, and i cant be honest with myself, im not entirely sure if i ""love"" this girl because im so damn afraid of being alone. But i do miss who i used to be, i was so creative, i would make some beautiful ass drawings, at least something id be proud of myself for, id would stay up all night smoking , listening to music that i could feel in my soul and in my bones. I would be so happy to see what i can make. I just dont feel that anymore. I think its because im dissapointed in myself.
Today is my 1 year anniversary with this girl, and i dont know what to do with my life. I hope shes not pregnant because i can't afford to have a kid, i dont wanna put them in the system either. I thi k we might take a visit to planned parenthood and after that i can finally find the excuse to split this up because i have no time for myself, i am stretched between my friends my 32+hours a week of work, responsibilities, my familt that im trying to put back together.
I got kicked out of my grandmas a couple years ago, she caught me smoking weed in the back porch, she told me to get out and gave me a look like i was my mom. My mom had drug and alcohol problems. I cant afford to see a therapist and my insurance doesnt cover one i think. I dont even bother to check, thats how seld destructove i am.
This might be alot for me to let go of, or maybe its not enough. I dont remember where i heard this but it went something like ""change happens when we are more uncomfortable with who we are than who we could be"" and goddam am i uncomfortable. I find a lot of comfort in rap. The emotional kind, not emo rap, im talking about when artists talk about how they really feel when everything gets quiet and you become aware of what is going on inside you. Geeze im really fucking stressed and full of anxiety and im really trying. The shit is just so damn hard

Is it just me, or is it that when you try to open up to people who's been hurting you, instead of consoling you, they will try to put the blame on you?

Is it bad to crave for their attention? Like: ""hey, i am hurting because of your actions. Maybe you can be as illogical as I am and try to understand me?""

Is it wrong to expect them for compassion instead of logic?

After so much time it took me to get used to it without her ..but all in vain my all scars are wet again ... I want to die now... rather living with this pain ... How can someone be so selfish ??
She called me multiple times today and after getting annoyed  I received it .

When she just started I realized how far we are from each other. Its been months i havent listened to her voice. And all of sudden she called and the pain I felt after that 38 seconds call !!! Maybe that's why I have been avoiding her calls.

she called me just to give her journal to her friend .. And in the end she specifically told me she called just for that...  I don't know what happened next she hung up and I started crying and I still am... It was 12:05 am (13.06.2019)

I just want to die now . I want someone to listen to me . Am I just meant for having all such pain, stress ,anxiety , headaches .

It was pneumonia that killed her.

I‚Äôm 90% sure.

Anyways, I‚Äôm writing this on my iPad which has the fuckin‚Äô weirdest keyboard layout in the world. My fingers are too short to type comfortably.

Who cares. I haven‚Äôt used this iPad in ages, don‚Äôt know why. Guess I just forgot about it. I spent 270 bucks on it, don‚Äôt know how I really forgot I had it.

I opened reddit and it was on my old account. The old account where I posted naively about self harm, even started making diary entries for a handful of days.

I cut myself for the first time on Oct. 23, 2018.

I read through the texts from the last year with mom. The last year of her life anyways. She told me that she was in the hospital with pneumonia on my birthday. I guess that‚Äôs what killed her. I realized I didn‚Äôt know shit about pneumonia so I googled it a bit.

I miss her SO much.

...

I am almost all packed for church camp. It‚Äôs not until the 26th, but I‚Äôm already prepared. I need to order some shorts though. I‚Äôve only got the one pair that are long enough to cover my legs. But I got these pajama pants today. They are light and airy. Blue with dark blue textured polka dots everywhere. I don‚Äôt have a good shirt. I want to get an really large T-shirt.

I feel so full. I drank 10 cups of water today. Not to mention too much food. I want to lose weight, but I felt pretty today, even with the weight. I felt like myself. My hair was wavy today, I slept in braids last night. I feel beautiful with wavy hair.

It‚Äôs raining out, and when I heard it I laughed. The local NPR station said there would be a change for thunderstorms and I almost said yeah right out loud.

I‚Äôm just tired. I want to wake up early tomorrow and get started with my day early.

The last few days been uplifting. I been getting compliments from various people saying that i am a hardworker and excellent guy. It was nice to hear. So i am appreciated. I am used to thinking i wasn't a good enough worker.

school been tough on me. I had more assignments to do including an essay in both classes. The last essay i turned in on sunday earned a B. the instructor commented that it was a fairly strong essay but forgot to use the times new roman font.  I felt good for that. i spent the whole weeking stressing on it because i wanted it to be perfect. I haven't started homework this week in both classes yet. I want to wait til friday to get it done since i have the whole day off from both jobs.

I want to look up ways to clean my body and organize my thoughts. i keep saying i am going to do it. I never follow through on it. cleaning my body, organize thoughts and improve my executive function. Those are the 3 things to improve.

as for my savings, i had to withdraw from it to pay my phone bill. I took more out to get fast food. I am doing it all fucking wrong. I was so good at savings until i bought that fucking fridge. I never got back on top.

How do i boost confidence? what does it feel to be confident? I never felt it my entire life. I am so used to being the timid quiet person. I never been a lion. always the lamb.

I can never have a platonic relationship with guys. Not without developing feelings or being attracted to them out of pure lust. I partially realized this. It is not fully confirmed until validated out loud.  I am lonely and i keep seeing friendship with males turning romantic. in reality its never going to happen and if i tried to anything sexual or even hint, chances are I can get my ass kicked and feelings hurt.  I repress those feelings and the insecurity comes out and i have thoughts of hating them and blocking them on all social media. Yesterday was my coworker's 21st birthday and i saw that he had over 400 comments saying happy birthday and so many people calling him. He even mentioned getting promoted at the grocery job and i wish him happy birthday and congratulations. deep down i felt jealousy. He worked at the grocery job less than 6 months and he gotten promoted quickly and gets compliments from customers on a daily basis. Hell a customer bought him lunch one day and i was so surprised. I want to be happy for him but i can't. I just think why can't it be me?? i should've been me. damn man.

In 10 minutes i will be punching in to work.
Thanks."
0,"11.06.19. My giraffe
I have this stuffed giraffe.

It‚Äôs soft and it‚Äôs cuddly and it has a cute little smile and four limbs positioned perpetually open for a hug.

And it‚Äôs just the right size for them, too.

I keep it in my room, and whenever I‚Äôm alone I carry it around with me. I sleep with it every night.

I got it last year, during my first summer home from school.

My first summer dealing with flashbacks.

And nightmares.

And panic attacks.

And everything else that happened last summer.

There‚Äôs this pile of stuffed toys in my room that the kids like to play with.

One day, I was sitting next to it.

And I thought: *I really need a hug.*

But there was no one around to ask for one.

I remembered being in the hospital after I tried to kill myself when I was a kid.

One of the doctors told my parents that I needed a hug.

So they went down to the gift shop and got me a little blue bunny, for baby boys.

(They were probably out of pink ones.)

And my parents gave it to me, so I would have something to hug.

I still have it. I bet it was somewhere in the pile.

But the bunny was for newborns - way too small for proper hugs.

And for whatever reason, hugging the bunny doesn‚Äôt make me feel better, even though it‚Äôs supposed to.

But I figured, maybe the doctor was onto something.

So I grabbed a different toy from the pile and wrapped myself around it and squeezed it tight.

It was the giraffe.

That giraffe was there to help me sleep when the dog or cat couldn‚Äôt stay in my room.

It was there when I needed something to hold onto because it felt like I was drifting away.

It was there through every panic attack, even the ones that lasted long into the night.

It was there every time I needed someone to stay with me while I cried. Or just to stay with me.

It was there every time I needed a hug.

No matter how many times.

The giraffe doesn‚Äôt care.

It‚Äôs just a toy.

It will be always be there for me.

No matter how big or small my worries are.

No matter what I‚Äôm feeling, or how long it lasts.

My giraffe just keeps being there.

When that summer ended, I brought the giraffe back to school with me.

And that stupid toy saw me through the rest of the worst year of my life.

After St. Patty‚Äôs, I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

My whole world had been turned upside down.

Everything felt so messed up, I couldn‚Äôt see how anything could ever be right again.

And I just wanted someone to give me a hug and tell me that everything was gonna be ok, so certain that they could believe it for me, because I still couldn‚Äôt.

My housemate got raped too, not long after me.

Her brother let her come over every single day for months so she could sit on his bed and cry and tell him everything while he listened.

Her sister helped her with her schoolwork when she started getting overwhelmed- even wrote an essay for her a couple times when she was in a pinch.

Her mom stayed up on the phone with her all night when she had so much anxiety that she was up until 4am puking in the bathroom.

She only went to counselling once.

She said: ‚ÄúWhy would I want to talk to a stranger? I‚Äôll just call my brother.‚Äù

That was all she needed.

Whenever I needed comfort, my giraffe was the only thing I knew would be there to give it to me.

Without hurting me.

Without taking advantage of me.

Without wanting anything in return.

My giraffe is always there to give me a hug.

It stays with me for as long as I want.

It would even listen to me, if I wanted to talk to it.

(I don‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs listening in spirit as I think things through in my head. It‚Äôs even sitting on my lap right now as I type this.)

It never judges me.

And sometimes, when things get really hopeless, I hold it up so I can look into its big, round eyes.

And its warm smile.

Its arms open for a hug.

And I imagine it saying: *Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.*

And then I pull it in close and squeeze.

All I ever wanted was a hug.

There‚Äôs a person-sized hole in my heart.

My giraffe isn‚Äôt it enough to fill it completely, but it takes up a little space.

Now, the hole‚Äôs that much smaller.

I know it‚Äôs stupid to love a stuffed toy.

...I‚Äôm nineteen years old, for fuck‚Äôs sake!

But it helps."

I jokingly posted on my story that my new aesthetic is crying on the bathroom floor while listening to music.

Which was meant to look like a joke, but it really isn‚Äôt. Although I wasn‚Äôt crying, I did feel empty inside.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about where my life would be right now if everything didn‚Äôt happen the way it did.

Would I still be mad at my mom all the time, or would I finally matured enough to stop listening to my dad and love her.

Would I still be as into art as I have? F and the arts provided a safe space for me this year and I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd be AS involved if I hadn‚Äôt needed it so badly.

Or maybe I‚Äôd be even more confident of a person. A better leader, a better friend, a stronger person.

But my life isn‚Äôt that way entirely.

I‚Äôm thankful for the pain in a way. I needed it. I deserved it. I would be nobody without it. Not to say my pain defines me, it just has played a huge part in who I am this year.

...

Milla and I texted a lot Saturday night. We‚Äôve talked before about wanting to lose weight. She‚Äôs not fat by any means at all, but she‚Äôs not a model either.

I‚Äôm a lot bigger than her. I don‚Äôt want to be.

My fat thumbs mock me as I type.

We made a pact for the summer. We would both ‚Äúglo‚Äù up. We both want to lose like 30 pounds.

We almost hung out today, but Jesus I have so much social anxiety. I cancelled because I was going to my grandmas.

She was gonna come over and we would go for a walk around the neighborhood. I told her I finally found F‚Äôs moms house after years of her living so close.

I walked by her house yesterday. The garage door was open but it shut when I approached.

I keep hoping that one of the times I walk by, F‚Äôs car would be in the driveway.

I don‚Äôt know why. Fuck. Why am I like this.

I‚Äôm not obsessive around him in person at ALL. Why is my head like this?!

If anything I‚Äôm extremely shy around him sometimes until I warm up a bit.

...

I showered and put some shit that‚Äôs supposed to make my hair curly in my hair. My sister told me it would totally work on flat hair. BS I thought. And I was right. My hair is as flat as a pancake.

I put on one of those sheet face masks my grandma bought for us. It was aloe. I sill have it on. My face is cold and goopy. Quiet music from grouper plays from my earbuds.

I‚Äôve been messing around with the weight loss app Milla and I downloaded. I ate a lot today. Thank GOD I skipped lunch. I still went way over my calorie goal.

I like the new app. ‚ÄúLifesum.‚Äù

It‚Äôs way more fun that my fitness pal.

I really really really don‚Äôt want to fuck it all up again. I NEED to lose weight.

I want to wear long flowey linen pants and lounge around in sandals.

I want to be able to find a bralette in my size, or be able to wear literally any article of women‚Äôs clothing from target or something.

I don‚Äôt want to be a clothing addict. I‚Äôm not. I just want to be comfortable. I‚Äôve been gravitating towards beiges lately.

I want to be the tall, skinny, red head me with wavy long hair and linen clothes and crazy earrings and freckles. And of course my glasses.

Not tall, fat, red head me with my blonde roots coming through. My hair as flat as paper. Bad posture, mismatching clothes, chubby cheeks with freckles. I don‚Äôt want to be that me anymore.

...

I always thought when people drew/painted pictures of lit windows at night, that they weren‚Äôt really yellow in person.

But as I look out of the window here in this strangely familiar bedroom, the window of a house across the way a bit is yellow.

A little yellow square casting yellow light onto the lawn/bushes.

I wish I lived here. I wish I could move in with my grandma full time.

I wouldn‚Äôt be a burden to her ever. I‚Äôd buy my own things and do my own laundry. Cook my own food and everything.

But I feel so grown up sleeping on this queen sized bed with soft covers. The only furniture in the room a couple dressers and a chair and a nightstand with a lamp and clock.

It‚Äôs a peaceful room. Meant for sleeping, and not much more. Truly a bedroom.

My bedroom at my house is a lot of shit crammed into one space. A bed, an art studio, a closet, everything.

But this change is nice.

...

I wish my grandparents would go to bed and turn the damn TV off. It‚Äôs almost 11 PM.

I want them to turn the light off so I can open the blinds and see out of the skylight in the living room."

I don‚Äôt quite know why I want what I want. I just need someone I look up to to be proud of me and my work.

Right now. That‚Äôs F.

But I don‚Äôt think of him that much. Not during my summer break anyways.

But I don‚Äôt have that pressure on me every day. To make something creative, beautiful, original, innovative. And that really takes a toll on me.

I need time to cultivate and present a beautiful body of work. And that‚Äôs what summer is for me. Well‚Äî what it was supposed to be.

I can‚Äôt let it slip away from me again. I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.

I need a 20 piece portfolio by December. That‚Äôs a LOT. I can do it, I just need a vision.

I need to visualize the whole of my portfolio in my head. Not piece by piece exactly, because that has never worked for me. I just need need to take baby steps.

I need 12 for a concentration.

Another 5-8 to show my full array of skills.

Tomorrow I‚Äôm staying at my grandmas again. Which means I probably won‚Äôt have time to eat a whole lot done. But sometimes I need that inspiration from every day life.

I want to make heavily detailed, rich prints, full of deep, dark colors. Blood red. Ocean blue.

Yet I also want to make beautifully light prints. Yellows with dainty black drawings. Precise marks. Pinks and grays.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll make my portfolio about.

My moods and emotions. My typical headspace.

But how unoriginal.

I don‚Äôt want to be innovative. I want to hit people in the heart. But not too hard. My parents see everything.

If only I had total and complete freedom. To depict whatever I please. I‚Äôd truly be free.

I could never bring my church friends to my art shows if I was totally true to the darkest parts of myself.

But that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll figure it out. I‚Äôm too shy to talk/show people deep shit anyways.

I just need to make one piece, and hopefully it will guide the rest.

I pray to the gods of art and fear.

I really want to do something with blood. But that‚Äôs fucked up. I have this vague image of a fruit bleeding in my head. I haven‚Äôt been able to shake it for days.

I‚Äôve refused to dive into the idea because it would be inconceivable to make. Right?

I‚Äôd need to come up with some good explanation for it. But that always comes later.

Making art is hard.

I‚Äôm gonna finish my podcast and sleep on it."

I can‚Äôt help but wonder what it all means.

My life. My art.

I dream to one day be inseparable. But that means being vulnerable in front of the world.

I‚Äôve got a whole portfolio in my head. I can imagine my work in galleries. I can imagine it being photographed just the right way. On a beautiful white wall.

I can imagine how it makes you feel. Me feel.

Yet I don‚Äôt make much.

Because the work in my head is real to me. More real to me than any drawing I‚Äôve ever made, any photo, any print I‚Äôve ever produced.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I feel so real, but feel so fake when asked to prove myself to people.

F sent the group chat a message about national art competitions for high schoolers. One in particular he pointed out. I took a look at it, and after a while started realizing that I‚Äôll never be a good artist. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have the skills, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt have any good subject matter.

I‚Äôm not political. I don‚Äôt have interesting heritage to make art about. I have nothing but myself. And my feelings. A whole plethora of them.

Music evokes feeling. So does dance. Film, and very rarely art.

Art is eye candy. Rarely soul candy.

...

It‚Äôs hot out here. My eyes squint and strain to see the keyboard on my phone. But the breeze is cool. It feels like summer.

The ocean of leaves rustling and the wind catches my hair just right.

This is what I love about life. The beautiful world we have. The sun on my skin. Soft linen shirts. Toes curled. A crystal lite pink lemonade.

I could make art about nature‚Äî man had been doing that for thousands of years. But I can‚Äôt make any contemporary art about the natural world without it being seen as ‚Äî god I don‚Äôt know, all that environmentalist shit.

Which I‚Äôm not opposed to at all.

I just believe this world won‚Äôt be around for much longer. There‚Äôs nothing I can ever do. And even if I devoted my whole life to it, in the end I‚Äôd barely make a dent.

But I can capture its beauty with the small things. Ugh. I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve just got so much emotion I want to put into art. Terrible pain and extreme serenity. The whole spectrum.

Some people make controversial art. I don‚Äôt.

And that‚Äôs okay. If I never make it big in the spotlight, because there will always be people out there like me who can appreciate it.

The quiet and lonely parts of life.

That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôll make art about loneliness. Maybe.

I can‚Äôt pick a whole theme for my life. My life changes. But I can decide on the next few pieces.

I won‚Äôt do that now.

I just want to lay here. Listen to the music. The birds chirping. Enjoying the last ‚Äúfree‚Äù summer of my life. The last summer without a gazillion responsibilities.

I love and hate growing up."

0,"09.06.19. The bad days
Sometimes, I have really bad days.

And everything feels like too much.

...But at the same time it feels like nothing‚Äôs really wrong and I made it all up because I‚Äôm too emotional.

And it feels like it‚Äôs never gonna get better.

...Because how can it get better if nothing‚Äôs even wrong in the first place and it‚Äôs all in my head?

And I feel completely alone.

I feel like no one can help me.

...Because how can they, if nothing‚Äôs even wrong?

But then I remember that I don‚Äôt need their help.

When I want something from others, I have to remember to just give it to myself instead.

That‚Äôs what healthy people do.

And I am not healthy.

I‚Äôm insecure.

And mentally ill, most likely. (I‚Äôll find out on Friday.)

So when I want someone to be here with me, to listen to me and tell me they‚Äôre sorry that all this is happening to me (if it even is. What if I just made it up?) and give me a hug and tell me that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok, I should just do all that to myself instead.

So I keep telling myself: *Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.*

And I just have to try my best to believe it.

When I want comfort, I have to give it to myself.

Because I can‚Äôt just keep lying in bed all day.

I have a math test, for fuck‚Äôs sake.

So I come up with a plan.

I have to be gentle with myself.

That‚Äôs what the internet said to do.

I can listen to myself wallow for one hour.

Then, I have to get up.

I set a timer.

Maybe then I‚Äôll take some Advil.

And go outside for a walk.

I probably should, since I‚Äôve just been lying in bed. It‚Äôll be good to stretch my legs.

It‚Äôs nice out today. Maybe the warmth and the sunshine will help me.

I can walk to the corner store and get some coffee.

Coffee always helps.

Plus, I need it to focus.

How can I do math without coffee?

When I get back, I‚Äôll study for as long as I can.

And I‚Äôll try to remember to eat and stay hydrated.

And if I do a good job, I can go to the dispensary downtown and buy some fancy weed. Something that will put me to sleep right away.

And after 5pm, I can smoke it.

Then hopefully I can go to bed early, unless my housemate gets mad that I don‚Äôt want to watch TV with him. I already skipped our usual show yesterday.

But watching TV with him isn‚Äôt bad.

I‚Äôll probably have fun.

And then tomorrow I‚Äôll write my math test.

And everything will be ok.

It just sucks right now.

But it won‚Äôt be like this forever, even if I really feel like it will.

Just because something looks like the end, that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt more I just can‚Äôt see yet.

That‚Äôs what my tattoo is there to remind me for.

It‚Äôs always there, even when I forget.

I just have to get through the bad days.

Everything‚Äôs gonna be ok."
0,"9:14 PM 6/8/19
Maybe things HAVE progressed. Just a bit. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in serious grief anymore, right?

What I‚Äôm dealing with isn‚Äôt just grief, it‚Äôs a lot of other shit all burritoed together.

I woke up, and it was so hard to get out of bed. I‚Äôm so sick of being awake. I hate myself so fucking much for not being productive this week. Next week will be like the first week of summer break. I‚Äôm going to get up early, shower, make myself a healthy breakfast, listen to podcasts/music, and work on stuff.

I just have to overcome this brain fog myself. I am in control of myself.

I have something to look forward to at least. I have something to practice for. I‚Äôve got art camp. I‚Äôm so SOOOO excited. I am not going to let myself be depressed for this. I still can NOT believe I‚Äôm truly going. I think my first diary entry was the day I found out I didn‚Äôt get a scholarship to the camp. I was devastated. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go.

But it fucking worked out. It always works out. And I need to remember that about the Santa Fe trip. Things might not look good now, but it‚Äôll happen/OR something better will happen. I‚Äôve been very lucky through life.

Except for mom.

But my life had been going almost too good up until that point. I remember on New Year‚Äôs Day of 2018 thinking that something bad was going to happen this year. Something devastating. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve got some psychic intuition, but I was right.

Jesus Christ. I was right. I was hurting so much last year, nothing at all compared to this year. Maybe that scare with F seeing my SH, but that pales with comparison to crying myself to sleep every night and waking up still crying.

One year ago today, I still went to work after mom died. I didn‚Äôt want to stay home, I mean, I did, but I didn‚Äôt want my dad to sit down and talk to us. I just needed to be somewhere else. Work for me is like a totally different life. I can shut off my emotions, what‚Äôs happening in my personal life, and just be a charismatic robot who takes food orders.

I don‚Äôt even think I cried that day. I wanted to cry. I wanted someone to ask me what was wrong. No one ever did. No one at work knows my mom died. Even though I was working there when it happened. No one knows. The only person who remembered my mom was Marilyn, but she quit.

And I‚Äôm okay with that. But it sucks. I want to tell people my mom died. But Jesus Christ what a conversation bomb. I can‚Äôt even bring it up when people ask me what‚Äôs wrong. I don‚Äôt want to make people deal with that.

I miss her, but I‚Äôve learned to block it out. I had to make a decision; live every day in grief but remember mom, or forget and move on with my happy life. It really hurts a lot.

I just want to hold her again. Look her in the eyes. Hear her voice. I can barely remember it. I wish I could see a video of her. I wish I had her fucking phone.

When Grammy dies, I want moms phone. I hope they didn‚Äôt get rid of it. And I want her ashes. I never have seen them. I never got to hold her.

Fuck them. They‚Äôre rich as shit. They could afford a casket. They could afford a fucking tombstone. But they didn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôll never know why.

I‚Äôm just so fucking sad and mad I‚Äôll never be able to visit her grave. Because she DOESNT FUCKING HAVE ONE. SHELL JUST BE ANOTHER FUCKING VASE IN THE HOUSE. JESUS CHRIST WHAT A TWISTED WORLD.

I miss her so much

More than I can say

Fuck.

Anyways. Work was ok. It was fun. My legs hurt a lot.

I want to die

I hate missing her so much"

Ahhh..  This migraine

While writing this I m having difficulty in concentrating on everything .

Yesterday, I went to hospital but came back in back home in the afternoon with my cousin when it was boiling hot outside...

I came home had a lunch and I passed out
I was sleeping for like 15 hours OMG..

And having some weird dreams about my problem related to someone who created it all...

My friend came from his hometown back to K-town yesterday he even called and texted me but unfortunately I was passes out ..

Will call him today definitely."

One of my favourite feelings is coming through the door when I‚Äôm the last one home and putting my key on the key holder next to all the others.

Then mine‚Äôs the fourth, and the set is complete.

Everything is in its place.

...Including me.

And I always smile to myself as I go upstairs.

Today, I was the last one home.

I put my key next to all the others.

But mine was only the third.

One of my housemates went away, indefinitely.

She got hurt pretty bad.

We don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs gonna be until she gets better and comes back.

Remember when I used to only post once a day?

I even told myself I would never post more than once.

That I should never need to use this as an outlet more than once a day.
That I should get out of my head and off the internet and live in the real world.

Lol!

Fuck that.

Today, I totally backslid.

I didn‚Äôt study *at all* even though I really needed to.

I spent most of the day lying in bed overthinking.

I even went on an online counselling service. I haven‚Äôt done that in months, since when I was really bad.

Although- I did end up going to Tim Horton‚Äôs with a friend. So at least I didn‚Äôt completely regress.

But I spent a lot of today dealing with all my crazy emotions.

Fuck.

Why am I so emotional?

Maybe it‚Äôs just PMS.

...That‚Äôs probably what it is.

But if it‚Äôs just my period, is any of this even real?

Fuuuck.

I wish I didn‚Äôt get PMS. How am I supposed to know if my feelings are real or if they‚Äôre just hormones making me crazy?

Every time I get PMS, it makes me question if I should even be feeling bad about any of the stuff that makes me feel bad.

Like, do I even feel bad about that stuff when I‚Äôm not on my period??

(The answer is obviously yes. I feel bad all the time. I‚Äôm all over the place.)

But since it gets worse when I‚Äôm on my period, it makes me feel like I just made everything up because I‚Äôm too hormonal.

Oh my god, I have so many fucking feelings today.

*Fuck* feelings.

Why can‚Äôt I be a computer?

Or a boy.

Boys don‚Äôt get periods!

...Or raped.

Well, that‚Äôs not true. Boys get raped.

But they get raped a lot less than girls.

If I was a boy, maybe I would be less afraid. Boys are less afraid of that stuff than girls. And they don‚Äôt get hit on as much, either!

Fuck boys.

Boys are stupid.

So are periods.

There‚Äôs been a lot of construction happening outside my house lately.

I don‚Äôt remember when it started.

It‚Äôs all background noise- I didn‚Äôt even pay attention to it.

They start working before I wake up, and they keep going long into the night. It‚Äôs just a part of my life.

Then today, all of a sudden, it stopped.

I‚Äôm not sure why.

It was only for a minute.

Something must have broken.

But for a minute of that one Saturday afternoon, everything stopped.

All the beeping.

All the engines growling.

All the thumping and the buzzing and the grinding and the sawing.

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it was there until it stopped.

And then the whole world was quiet.

And I felt some of the tension melt away.

And I realized all that noise was giving me a headache.

And it felt really nice to have some quiet.

Then it turned back on again.

When the construction started up again, I finally realized how loud it was.

And I hated how much harder it was to focus.

And I hated how it never stopped.

And I *hated* all the noise.

And even though I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it before, now I wanted it gone more than anything.

Then my ears got used to the sound, and it faded back into the background again.

But now, every time something beeps, I remember how nice the quiet was for a minute.

It reminds me of my feelings.

For a minute, once, my brain got quiet.

All the mental illness went away.

I just... existed. No extra noise.

Then it turned back on again."

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt feel better today.
I feel better. But it‚Äôs just this empty feeling I haven‚Äôt been able to shake all day.

Even at work. I just felt kind of numb.

I woke up late. I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I woke up and remembered the shitty 40 min conversation I had with fuckin‚Äô Denise from the suicide hotline chat.

Jesus. She told me the same thing everyone tells me. You should talk to F. You should reach out, get help.

And I almost believed I would, that I really could.

But like I said, I felt better today. Which isn‚Äôt totally unusual. I‚Äôll go back to feeling better, maybe even happy this next week, and something will happen and I‚Äôll just spiral out of control back to the fucked up part of my head that just wants to watch me suffer and pay for the shit I do.

I‚Äôm sick of the cycle. And I‚Äôm just numb from it all.

I wanted to feel SOMETHING, god, just anything. And I really wanted to cut. It just wouldn‚Äôt be satisfying. My left thigh has no space left. My right either. I need to let them heal for a few weeks before camp.

But I still wanted to be in that headspace. I decided to draw what was going through my head. I‚Äôm embarrassed honestly. I drew what looks like some edgy tumblr post that kid used to show me on the bus back in middle school.

Jesus Christ, I used to make fun of her. She was trying to reach out to me for help, and I just thought she was attention seeking.

I made the mistake of drawing in my new sketchbook. It was so satisfying. But I realized I‚Äôm fucked because I was going to fill the entire journal with life drawing and just turn that in as my summer work instead of 10 drawings.

I taped over it with paper.
[https://prnt.sc/nz48t0](https://prnt.sc/nz48t0)
[https://prnt.sc/nz48z7](https://prnt.sc/nz48z7)

I‚Äôll draw over it and it‚Äôll look like nothing interesting is there. I really just do that so if some random person asks to see my sketchbook, they won‚Äôt have the audacity to remove the tape and look underneath it in front of me.

But if I never end up being able to talk to F, I secretly hope when I turn in the entire sketchbook when school gets back, that he‚Äôll look under the paper.

Look at the fucking desperate things I do for attention. Jesus.

Today was boring as hell. I spent a few hours making intricate packing lists for both camps.
I need to order more clothes and some random shit like an umbrella, and a hairbrush. I‚Äôve seemed to have lost my hairbrush somehow.

Cue ‚ÄúOh where is my hairbrush.‚Äù

So I am just going to post my ranting and complaining about my situationship and my asshole boyfriend.

It's supposed to be a relationship but it honestly feels more like roommates. He is a very unemotional person so its hard to get much out of him.

I don't want flowers or presents everyday. I just want him to listen to me. Actually listen and not get offended or totally zone out. Complimenting me would also be great too. But I guess I can't ask for too much. Or anything.

We've been together for almost 6 years and have an almost 5 year old.

So yeah I got pregnant 3 months into it.

He has talked to other girls, gone on fetish sites to post his dick pics and complain about me. The list goes on.

I know I know I should not be with him. Especially not raise my daughter to think it's okay. I just for some stupid reason. Love him. He is my comfort zone.

Maybe that's what it is.

He was with me the whole pregnancy. He was with me when I had preeclampsia. He was with me when the headaches started. He was with me when I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

I feel like that's what he's still here though.

He doesn't want to be the jerk that breaks up with his daughter's mother who has MS and kick her out of the house.

Today, i find myself thinking alot about my relationship. Im so used to constant contact, instant replying and i dont have that with this one. I went from ""The Best"" to nothing within three weeks, I say i love you and its pushed to the side. I feel like all my effort, all my emotion is being drained into a blackhole. All i want is you and you know this, I came to you with a shattered heart and i glued it together to give you a chance. I take one step and if its wrong, I get repercussions. But if you were to take that step, I would hold it back. I am nothing, Im just trash that one person picks up and puts into anothers container. I want to know why. Why am i suffering. I took 7 months of having my love one-sided and your doing it to me now. Love works, Love doesn't work. Does it matter? Your the most beautiful in the world while i sit here and cry for the attention... A person will love you, A person has limits. A person will show you the day, the day of the most love. and you will push that to the side and that day will be the last day, You will be loved. Suffering till the end, No help, No care.

Today started off shitty.

But then I met a cat.

3 cats, actually.

I was walking past when I heard meowing.

And I looked over, and there were a bunch of cats looking back.

For a moment, we all just stared at each other.

Then I said: ‚ÄúHi babies!‚Äù and clicked my tongue.

And they ran right over!

And all of a sudden I had two cats (the third hung back to watch) rubbing themselves all over me, meowing and batting at my hand to pet them.

I don‚Äôt know exactly how long I stayed there for.

Honestly, I think it was at least an hour.

But it was a beautiful, sunny day to sit outside with my new friends.

They were so soft!

And SO cute and friendly!!

I played with them and petted them like I was in some kind of trance. No other thoughts even crossed my mind. I was totally focused on them.

I probably looked like a lunatic, giggling with a bunch of stray cats. I even talked to them!

(I always talk to animals like they‚Äôre people. Especially cats. On some level, I think they understand. Or at least they appreciate that I respect them enough to treat them like an equal. Lol!)

I hung out with the cats until they stopped coming back to me for more.

Then we gave each other one last look, and went our separate ways.

This isn‚Äôt even a diary anymore.
Just my rants to the void.
And sometimes, someone will read them.

But I guess I should at least explain today, I‚Äôd been looking forward to it all week right?

I woke up and this overwhelming feeling loomed over me. I wake up with extreme anxiety. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt remember what happened last night. I‚Äôm trying to remember what I need to do today, and tomorrow.

I‚Äôm just grasping for anything. It‚Äôs all so overwhelming. And then I remember something that happened last night, and one by one, one thing leading to the next. I get a grip on things.

That is, only if I have something I have to do.

And I remembered today was Thursday. I remembered I was going to school to work and see F today. Then I remembered he hadn‚Äôt let me know if he was going to be there or not. I thought about texting him again, I almost did. And then I worried over it for hours. Since 6:40 AM.

Until 10:15ish. He messaged me and said he was at school. He said I could come.

‚ÄúHey ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. I am here. I don‚Äôt need any assistance but if you want to come up and work you can.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt need any assistance. OK?

I got my shit together and dad drove me to the back of the school. F let me in the doors.

And it was so weird. It was like greeting an old friend, but you pretend like nothings changed, although you can‚Äôt quite remember what things used to be like. He asked how my summer was going. I just said ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Which if I‚Äôll be honest, wasn‚Äôt a total lie up until this week. I was so fucking awkward. I‚Äôm so fucking STUPID. I put these fucking walls up, and then people don‚Äôt want to talk to me. God‚Äî I wish I weren‚Äôt like that. I wish I could just be HONEST.

I set my bag on the table and I kind of explained the art stuff I got. And he disappeared into the changing room. I worked alone for most of the time. For at least an hour or two.

The plate etching worked perfectly. I‚Äôve got it figured out. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt decide what to do because I thought I was done because I left one supply I needed at home. I went into the changing room to show him the outcome.

I said I‚Äôd finally be able to do real ones instead of these fucking doodles. He came out of the room and we talked for a minute. He asked if I was doing another one or gonna do anything else. I said I was, but I‚Äôd left it at home. Then I texted my dad to go to my room and find the supply I left and bring it to me.

I sat around waiting for him to bring it. He asked if I‚Äôd heard from/hung out with anyone else from the class. I said I‚Äôd stopped by Milla‚Äôs house briefly, and texted Lilah a bit, but that was about it. He asked when my art camp was again. We talked about the giant cyanotype he had made. It was HUGE.

And then he went back into his little room. I went outside to get the stuff from my dad. I realized I forgot to put a stop in the door and I got locked out for a second. But F let me back in.

It‚Äôs so strange. How I idolize him, yet in person, I‚Äôm fucking shy and get mad at him and he just disappears. He always just disappears into that room.

Finally he came out and started working on his computer while playing some history podcast he was listening to. We talked about podcasts briefly. He said he listened to HBM, the one I love and thought he would like.

He said he didn‚Äôt really like it.

He didn‚Äôt like it.

God. How could I be so fucking stupid?????

He asked me if I‚Äôd read any of Art & Fear. I said I‚Äôm on my second reading of it. I told him how I‚Äôd bought the author‚Äôs other, similar book. I told him I‚Äôd lend it to him when I was done.

Anyways. Things got less awkward, but no less than I usually am.

I don‚Äôt know why I idolize him.

I know why I did.

I don‚Äôt know why I still do.

I‚Äôm realizing things are never going to be the same. They might be better, or worse. I just don‚Äôt know.

And he talked more about the Santa Fe trip. He said we can make it an official school trip. But he said the only issue is that he and his wife would have to go for free. Which I don‚Äôt blame him. Either we‚Äôd have to raise almost 2k. OR we‚Äôd have to collectively pay for them.

There is NO WAY we can raise 2k.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve lost interest in everything. I need to focus on ME this summer. I can‚Äôt afford to waste time doing some fundraiser.

I‚Äôd rather just pay extra for them.

I should have said I‚Äôd taken more hours on to pay for the Santa Fe trip when he asked me about work and shit.

FUCK.

UGHHHH!

I finished up. Said thanks. Etc.

And I went home. Baked my plates in the oven for a while. Then let them dry.

I messaged F once more. I thanked him for letting come by and work.

He said, ‚ÄúOf course. You‚Äôre welcome. Let me know whenever you want to come up and work. I‚Äôm happy to have you around if I‚Äôm going to be there. Happy etching!! I‚Äôm anxious to see a plate FOR REAL.‚Äù

I know he‚Äôs serious, and being sarcastic, but I can‚Äôt help but worry if he‚Äôs sick of me doing all these fucking tests. I don‚Äôt want to let him down. I want to make a good plate.

But every idea I can think of is so vile.

But he said he‚Äôs happy to have me around. Or was he being passive, or did he sincerely mean it. Fuck.

I had a mental breakdown this afternoon. Finished season 5 of black mirror. I really don‚Äôt like this season AT ALL. The stories are interesting, but the endings don‚Äôt feel like black mirror.

I just lost it. I wrote a diary entry that sounded like a fucking mental person wrote it.

I still am depressed AF right now. I just want to stay in bed for the rest of my life.

I wish I weren‚Äôt like this.

Why can‚Äôt I be happy?"

Added some fuckin format

I wish these entries were personal.
```
Every fucking day
I go out
And do things
And see people
And talk to them
All fake

All so FUCKING shallow
Every interaction is selfish
Even my own
There‚Äôs not a person on Earth with exception.
Not even fucking F.

And I‚Äôm SO happy with them.
And that‚Äôs not a lie.
I LOVE fucking being the outside
Person I am
That person is shallow
Fucking people pleaser
Desperate for attention
Good or bad

Embarrassing or not
She fucking runs to it
And the SECOND
I‚Äôm alone.
The second I have to face
my true self
There is so much pain

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm drowning in a headache
Every thought
Everything I think
Turns into self hatred

And I hide it
From everyone. From my family. From those I actually care about. From even my outer self.
I‚Äôm here rotting
And NO ONES GOT A FUCKING CLUE

I could ask for help
Not that anyone in the world could truly help me
I‚Äôm the only one that can help me
But I fucking hate myself
And even if they knew
Would they really care
I mean REALLY

Or would they be sad for a while
Even feel sympathy
‚Äî FUCK
everything is pointless
The only think that makes sense in my head is ME = BAD
Therefore
PUNISH ME

AND No one and their fucking bullshit wisdom can help me. Because I‚Äôll always be like this.
When is IT FUCKING GONNA END.

Because it won‚Äôt end when I speak up. Maybe my outer self might feel a little better.

But ME. I‚Äôm damned.
What‚Äôll I do HUH?
Make it another year or two
While I get fucking worse and worse
If she makes it to art school
Can she rely on me for her fucking ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù

Because she‚Äôs got 3 weeks left
Until her freedom is gone
Her fucking freedom to make whatever the hell she wants
Whatever I want
But all I wanna depict
Is my bloody body
The earth, the trees screaming in agony
The lightning smiting the very earth that created it
Because it was born to hate
Fake fucking people
Self obsessed
My own corruption
On display for the fucking world

I want to photograph me
Not her
But photos show the physical world
I‚Äôm fucking here
Alone.

And I‚Äôll always and forever be alone.
Maybe she‚Äôll find her soulmate. The ‚Äúone.‚Äù
But when he‚Äôs gone. When she lies awake at night. She‚Äôll have to confront me

Because I‚Äôm fucking all I‚Äôve got right now.

I want to rip my body apart and die.

I won‚Äôt fuckin do it

But it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to

I wish someone would knock me out
I don‚Äôt want to be conscious right now

I feel like I‚Äôm losing it

0,"06.06.19. Arguments
I got in an argument with my mom today.

And with my housemates.

...And also with some friends.

I guess I was feeling a little argumentative.

My mom called me a stubborn brat who hates losing.

But I don‚Äôt argue to win.

I argue to lose.

I like hearing different opinions. I like having my perspective changed.

But the thing is, I‚Äôm not gonna let just anyone change my core beliefs.

If you‚Äôre gonna prove me wrong, you have to prove it.

And the only way to prove something is to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

You wouldn‚Äôt send a murderer to death row if you only *kind of* thought he really killed that guy.

So why would I let someone change my mind without looking for the flaws in what they‚Äôre saying?

If your opinion passed all my tests, I respect it.

But it has to pass *all* my tests.

I am always willing to change my mind.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean arguing with me is easy.

The problem is, some people take my questioning as a personal attack.

But it‚Äôs not *about* them.

It‚Äôs about the argument.

They don‚Äôt care.

They get angry.

They call me names.

They refuse to keep arguing with me.

...Which means I win.

But it doesn‚Äôt feel like winning.

And honestly, a lot of the times I wish they would just stay calm and prove me wrong.

It‚Äôs boring being right.

I want to have my mind blown with something I‚Äôve never thought of before.

I want to give an argument everything I can and still lose.

But usually things get too heated long before then.

So I don‚Äôt argue with people often.

But, to everyone who simply stops arguing with me because it bothers them that I don‚Äôt blindly accept their opinion.

To everyone who tells me that I‚Äôm pushy or conceited or obsessed with winning.

To everyone who stops listening when I stop agreeing with them.

I‚Äôm *right*.

And if you disagree, prove it.

I‚Äôm listening."

Sorry, this is the third post today.

I‚Äôm really trying
To not believe the lies

I catch myself just verbally abusing myself inside my head. Telling me my dad is mad at me, that he is disappointed. My friends all think I‚Äôm selfish and a crybaby. My dad thinks my friends are annoying. F thinks I‚Äôm annoying. Which he probably does right now. I‚Äôll never get printmaking figured out. My art is shallow. Nothing I make is any good. I bother F but never make anything good.

He was at school today and didn‚Äôt tell me.

He said he‚Äôd tell me.

But I FUCKED UP

And HAD TO FUCKING ASK HIM IF I COULD COME USE THE DAMN ETCHING SOLUTION in SUMMER.

He said sure, even when I doubted him. He made sure I realized I was more than welcome.

But I must‚Äôve done SOMETHING

GO FUCKING FIGURE. I am so annoying. Ali probably thinks I‚Äôm a clingy crybaby. So does P. And I‚Äôm trying to be patient with P because I know she‚Äôs got a lot going on right now, but sometimes I feel like she hates everyone and everything. Including me.

I don‚Äôt know if I should go to school tomorrow. Even if he says yes.

He said, ‚ÄúI think  I will be. I plan to get up there about 10 or so and stay for a while. I will let you know. ‚Äú

But ugh I hate texting because I can‚Äôt detect tone. He says he thinks he might be, thus implying that he had been considering not being there. Because he was already there today. And yet the next sentence he says he might go at about 10 and stay for a while. This implying yes.

But I feel like a fucking bother to him.
I probably am. Shit. Fuck.

Oh my god I can‚Äôt deal with another panic attack right now.

I just need someone to be nice to me.

Not just the sarcastic interactions.

I need a fucking human to just look me in the eyes and tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay.

What if he forgets about me tomorrow?

What if my dad doesn‚Äôt let me?? He already seems mad at me now. He didn‚Äôt say a peep the whole ride home with Alex.

I would be mad at me too. I‚Äôve been a shitty daughter who wants to fucking do art‚Äî of all professions.

But maybe I‚Äôm not cut out for it. I love doing it with all my heart, but I don‚Äôt even know how to love myself. I don‚Äôt know if I even can.

Maybe I need God.

But I really would rather have man.

Because man can look me in the eyes and tell me that I‚Äôm doing okay, even good.

Jeez, I ruin so many friendships when I open up.

Maybe I‚Äôm destined to be fake. But that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing. Faking happiness.

That‚Äôs not totally true. Some people do make me purely happy. I just don‚Äôt believe that I do them the same.

UGHHH I REALLY WISH THIS WASNT HAPPENING

I FUCKING HOPE F ISNT ANNOYED WITH ME

OR MY DAD

OR MY FRIENDS

I just wanna cry myself to sleep again.

But I don‚Äôt wanna wake up crying again.

I should just disappear."

It was so tiring day may be because I haven't slept for 20 hours but finally, the month of blessing has been ended ..

Last day before Eid I have been to my aunt's place because my uncle had minor heart attack that day and he has been in the hospital since then ...

After prayer we had breakfast then my other uncle came home.. I received many wishes from my friends and relative but idk may be I was waiting for someone special to wish even though I know she will not text ever ... While having these thoughts I slept and woke up by a call from my father it was 10 pm . It was routine call then I came to know that no one is in the house except for my one younger brother .. Everyone  went to aunts place but she was very upset ...

The whole last month I haven't studied .
I should study more often from now on ..
Got a video msg from my friend H who went to his hometown to celebrate Eid ..

I am not allowed to smoke until 5pm.

That‚Äôs how I make sure that I‚Äôm not slipping back into old habits.

If I smoke before 5pm, it means I have a problem.

Even if it‚Äôs 4pm.

Even if I‚Äôve done all my homework.

Even if I‚Äôm having a really hard day.

A really, really hard day.

I will not smoke until 5pm.

Even if there‚Äôs nothing else to do.

If I smoke before 5pm, then I‚Äôm throwing away all the kindness and privileges and second chances I‚Äôve been given to get back to where I am right now.

All the hard work I‚Äôve put into changing.

Any chance of having a bright future.

...If I even have a chance at a bright future.

Better not risk it.

Chances are slim enough as is.

I will not smoke before 5pm.

Even if I have a headache.

Even if I feel like crying.

Even if my head is spinning and my heart is racing and I can‚Äôt quite think straight.

Even if it‚Äôs all I want to do.

I am *not* allowed to smoke before 5pm.

Even if it‚Äôs 4:45pm.

Even if it‚Äôs 4:59pm.

If I let myself smoke before 5pm once, then I‚Äôll do it again. Then again, even earlier.

Then suddenly I‚Äôll be high for 3 days straight and failing out of school and unable to leave the house except to go buy more.

I already used my second chances.

Fuck it up again, and I‚Äôll have to deal with the consequences alone.

I finally got my art supplies in the mail.

I went to town on them right away. Tested out cleaning the plate with whiting, which worked great.

Then my dad left to get a haircut with my sister so I went and applied the ground to the plate like they did in the video. It went on smoothly and looked amazing!

However when I went to wash it off, it got all over my hands and would NOT come off. I started freaking out a bit.

Then I heard the garage door open and I went into panic mode and threw the cheap ikea coffee table I used as a surface into my room, and tried to hide the evidence.

My dad came in and was inspecting the mess I made at the sink and was yelling at me to clean it up. He went downstairs while I assured him I‚Äôd clean it all.

Although I had no fucking idea how to get it off. I looked online, tried some shit under the sink, and even emailed the company in a panic asking for help.

When cleaning at the sink, I felt a dull pain in the bottom of my stomach and got super light headed trying to clean. I started feeling weird, then everything was growing cold, and my eyesight was going dark so I fell back on the floor of the kitchen and laid there trying to get blood back to my head.

Until my sister came around the corner and I sprang up and went back to cleaning. I got up and laid on the couch blankly responding to her whining about her ruined haircut.

I realized I couldn‚Äôt fix this myself and I asked my dad to help. He was mad at first and banned me from using that stuff in the house again. I said okay. He helped me clean it up. He used gasoline to get it off. We went outside and I washed my hands with gas. My hands are pink.

While he was doing something in the garage, I snuck into his room to steal some more pain meds so I wouldn‚Äôt faint.

Note to self.

Don‚Äôt fucking cut yourself three nights in a row while ON YOUR PERIOD. Especially not on pain killers.

So I‚Äôve probably lost more blood than I should have. I‚Äôm fucked. I hope it comes back? I‚Äôve got no clue how blood works.

All I know is that I am never in a million years talking to my dad about my self harm.

That means never talking to anyone at school. Never talking to a therapist. Never talking to anyone. Ever. I probably shouldn‚Äôt write about it on my phone.

I probably shouldn‚Äôt go to the pool at camp this summer even in shorts.

I must be careful at camp because if any of my church friends find out, so will my dad.

I‚Äôm fucked.

Now I can‚Äôt get my plate ready to go etch at school tomorrow. I‚Äôm kind of done with printmaking.

I want to learn it SO BAD, but I just can‚Äôt do it myself. I need to learn.

I‚Äôm so fucked.

My leg hurts.

Why did I do this.

I need to shower and get the gasoline stench off me.

I ruined my brand new 15$ shirt.

I‚Äôm a fuck up.

I just messaged F asking if he would still be at school tomorrow. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to tell him.

I‚Äôll need to make a decision if I want to keep trying right now.

I am SO fucked."

Tonight my mom died. A year ago.

I lived a year of my life without the person who brought me to life.

I‚Äôm mad I‚Äôm not more sad. Yet I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve healed a little.

There‚Äôs something wrong with me. For real. And I‚Äôm not just saying that lightly anymore. I‚Äôm mentally ill‚Äî

I obsess over my teacher for being nice to me.

I isolate myself from my real life friends and never tell them anything because I‚Äôm terrified I open up, that they‚Äôll avoid me.

I rely on total strangers on the internet to provide some social interaction. I then tell them more than they need to know, and I hurt others when I hurt myself.

I cut myself a bunch of times until there‚Äôs enough blood to run down the bath into the drain. Because I hate myself, and feel so alone.

I‚Äôm selfish. I lie. I manipulate people. I‚Äôm awful.
Fuck.

Oh my fucking god. I have 90% of the symptoms of BPD. My mom had BPD.

Fuckkkjj fuck fuck fuck I can‚Äôt be ill. I can‚Äôt be BPD. I am almost a textbook example according to this website. Although I‚Äôm not totally reckless. That‚Äôs the only thing. [http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/)

My dad thought my mom had BPD. He thought she was crazy.

I think I have BPD. If I‚Äôm still like this in a year or two. I‚Äôm going to talk to a therapist/psychologist.

Jesus Christ. I‚Äôm a monster. A disgusting outcast. Fuck me.

It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve looked at other disorders and conditions before but I never fully match. BPD is the first one that I understand and literally describes me.

I don‚Äôt wanna be medicated oh god fuck. But no one will ever know. I won‚Äôt tell a soul.

I‚Äôm not THAT bad.

I‚Äôm just clingy and hate myself at the base line.

Fuck....

I stared thinking about doing my diary entries manually in a journal or something irl, but it‚Äôs just so much easier to type. I hate handwriting.

After work I got home and checked discord. I hadn‚Äôt checked it since last night after bre left. I was joking about how much I hate myself, and I think she got mad. Which why the fuck did she get mad at ME for hating myself?

So when I got back on, I saw that they had muted me for an hour because I ‚Äúbroke the rules.‚Äù Which is stupid, because it wasn‚Äôt clear which rule I broke.‚Äù

I felt like shit regardless. Before work I got a letter from Grammy saying something about my mom. She attached a message my mom sent her a week before she died. The letter said something about how much my mom loved me and was so proud of me.

So I was crying in my room because I fucking missed my mom. I posted a picture of her on my close friends insta story. I kind of ranted about how unfair life is and how much I missed her.

Then after that was when I checked discord.

I needed to hurt myself. I needed to pay for what I did to Bre and I needed to get all this sadness and anger out over mom.

So I sat on the side of the tub and sliced my leg a bunch of times.

Not as much as I wish I would have.

I‚Äôll count here in a minute. 67.

I hate that these diary entries are so fucking sad and gross and I hate myself so much for it.

I want to die sometimes.

I deserve it more than anyone.

It‚Äôs June 4th.

But let‚Äôs talk about yesterday.

Woke up, got ready, threw some shit in a bag and my grandma picked my sister and I up.

We stopped at McDonalds and grabbed a breakfast sandwich. For some reason I‚Äôve eaten a ton of McDonald‚Äôs lately. I hardly EVER eat there.

We stayed at her house for a while and talked. We brainstormed what we might do with the day. After a lot of bad ideas, and stuff that we‚Äôve already done, my grandma suggested we just go out driving towards *art college.*

Obviously I was like, ‚ÄúHell yeah.‚Äù The last time I was there it was night and I could barely see.

So we drove down there with no instructions, taking the back roads, getting lost, missing exits. It was fun. Eventually we found it, and it was just as it‚Äôs always been. A cute little campus downtown.

And I am SO EXCITED to stay there for three weeks. I‚Äôm gonna have SO much fun. I hope I make some good friends.

Anyways, after we drove by it once or twice, we ended up near the art store in WP. We went in, the lady working there was really nice and told us about this weird paper that was hella expensive. She talked about workshops they did there, and said we should come.

I know of one of the artists who‚Äôs doing the next workshop there, well, he works at the store and I‚Äôm fairly certain he‚Äôs checked me out once or twice with my mom. He‚Äôs got cool art. I follow him on Insta.

I didn‚Äôt buy anything at that store because they are always out of shit. I love the place, because I‚Äôve just got so many fond memories going there, but it‚Äôs just always out of stock on popular stuff.

So we went to the other art store down in the CR. Which I fucking LOVE. They got a new door, which was a big improvement from the old one. They have so many cool knick nacks and shit and always are stocked in everything, even stuff you‚Äôve never dreamed you needed.

After like an hour of deciding, I finally picked out a sketchbook. Not to big, not too small, the paper wasn‚Äôt too white, it was ivory. The cover wasn‚Äôt black, it was brown. (Which was nice for a change.) There wasn‚Äôt too many sheets, and it wasn‚Äôt a spiral, which I was kind of nervous buying it because of that.

I got a couple of pens, and a pencil with RED LEAD. I knew they made red pencils, but not red lead for mechanical pencils!!

After that we dropped off the peppa pig scrunchie at Milla‚Äôs house, then went home, decided to skip lunch for then and just wait for dinner. I started drawing in my sketchbook when I got home. I drew the fireplace.[https://prnt.sc/nxiuih](https://prnt.sc/nxiuih)

My sister and grandma went off to some dumb ass store my sister wanted to go to, so I got some alone time to draw. I was really hungry by then.

When they got home, my grandma finished dinner and we all ate. I helped my sister make that banana pudding shit that is so good.

After dinner I was chilling in the living room being a sad shit thinking sad thoughts and being a bit of a bum. I didn‚Äôt want to cry in front of my family, so I went upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom. I talked to a friend, who probably saved me from going to town on my thighs with a pair of scissors I found. I owe her a lot. ;‚Äô-)

At about 8 I went downstairs for half an hour and ate some of that pudding we made. I got sad again and went to go back to hiding in the bathroom, I was more mad at my sister than sad.

I brought my sketchbook, and flipped to a new page and started drawing the window in the bathroom. All of those small lines and shit. I realized the plus side of having a moleskin sketchbook is that I can use both sides of the page without a big spiral in the middle.

I didn‚Äôt finish. I drew and listened to sad music over and over. Specifically one song I randomly happened upon earlier in the evening. Lighthouse by Grouper. I drew until about 10 and then got up and went back to bed.
[https://prnt.sc/nxizlm](https://prnt.sc/nxizlm)

And now it‚Äôs 9:59 in the morning and I should get ready.

OhH I forgot!

Whilst sitting on the floor of the bathroom crying like a loser, F messaged me on group me.

Anyways, back to today, I feel gross. My hair is greasy. My linen shirt is all wrinkled the wrong way. I probably smell. I didn‚Äôt bring my toothbrush‚Äî oh wait, my grandma has one for me.

Anyways. I have to work tonight. Only for a few hours. But in the meantime, I can spend the morning with my grandma. I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll do."

Fuck, I skipped another day.

I hate forgetting.

But maybe I didn‚Äôt need to write, because I talked to multiple people yesterday who really knew me - as much as I‚Äôve been willing to share with people.

I was able to be authentic with them.

So I didn‚Äôt really have anything I needed to write about. I just talked to my friends.

Yesterday was the first day back at my 2nd job at the swimming pool. it was a few familiar faces and some new. i spent the whole time cleaning and throwing shit away because the pool place opens this way and everything has to look good. My depression was in full bloom so i felt like complete shit the whole time. I kept thinking to myself why am i here? i rather be somewhere dead. sorry to say that but its the truth. after work i grabbed lunch from a local family restaurant and went home to change for my nephew's 8th grade graduation. The program lasted an hour. I seen so many guys there dressed up. The urge to go up to a random guy and grab his ass was strong. I kept myself under control. after the program was done all the parents rushed out of there like it was no tomorrow. It was so many people all up on me and i was so overwhelmed by it.  i almost had a meltdown. now im home in bed late at night.  Today is my first back at the grocery store job. i will not be looking forward to seeing everyone. They are a bunch of lazy pig whores who never wants to work. All i need is a miracle to get away from the hellhole for good.

So far one of the tiring days in Ramadan . Its probably the last suhoor atm ...

Woke up at 9 am seriously disturbed by the construction work going on and only slept for 2 hours ..  Went to pensioners office with my grand mom but surprisingly they were out of cash due to last working day before vacation...

I have seen some really senior citizen there waiting for like 3 to 4 hours...

Then decided to buy those item that will not be available during Eid vacations ..

It was too hot out there today ... Then came back home and turned on my TV to watch world cup match .... And while thinking that how many relative and family friends will visit us this time ...

Then I don't know I slept there watching TV woke up at 5 prepared for iftaar and then enjoyed the last moments of the match ..

Most probably today will be the last day of Ramadan...."

It‚Äôs been about three months since I started logging entries into my diary here on Reddit.

That‚Äôs roughly 90-100 logs. All long, some short.

I should go back and read some of the ones from March. But I just remember them being depressing and so lonely.

I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve made progress. Not just in the past three months, but the last year.

Tomorrow night, one year ago, my mom died in her sleep. I still have no official cause of death. They didn‚Äôt say‚Äî probably something to do with her sickness.

But that‚Äôs the thing. She wasn‚Äôt sick, really. From what I was told, it was no more than usual. She‚Äôd always had SOMETHING going on. First it was the bipolar, the depression (which I wasn‚Äôt even aware of until shortly before her death.) the fibromyalgia, the diabetes.

But she was fine. She‚Äôd go to the hospital every blue moon for something or another. But she was fine. I think the diabetes even went away. And she didn‚Äôt seem too badly affected by the fibromyalgia.

But some fucking cold, or pneumonia was what did it. A week or two before the night she died, she told my dad she couldn‚Äôt pick us up for a while because she couldn‚Äôt drive‚Äî she‚Äôd had a seizure and came back from the hospital.

Which didn‚Äôt even faze me. She went to the hospital for some weird reason or another every year. She was still going to work, a coworker would pick her up in the morning and drive her.

From what I knew she was fine. She sung me happy birthday a week before on a voicemail. Even texted me a couple of days before.

But she fucking died in her sleep. Sometime Monday night on June 4th 2018. Which what the fuck does that mean? How does a 40ish woman just die in her sleep? Was it a seizure? Was it a heart attack? What the fuck was it??

Her coworker came to pick her up in the morning. No answer. She must‚Äôve gotten ahold of the police, or my moms dad.

Grandad texted me and asked me the password to her phone sometime Tuesday. I gave it reluctantly. I had no reason to believe she was dead. That didn‚Äôt even cross my mind.

But it was Wednesday afternoon I found out. We spent the day at my grandmas. Decided to go to the pool at the community center right next to where we used to live. Where I lived for 7 odd years. Where my mom and dad once lived together, until one October night my dad explained that my sister and I would get to have two Halloween‚Äôs.

Oh my god.

That‚Äôs why my dad was upstairs so much.

Holy shit. He even had a bed in his office. Oh my god I‚Äôm just now realizing this. Jesus Christ. How could I be so stupid.

Fuck. Anyways. We were at the pool. We‚Äôd only been there half an hour when grandma called us over to the side of the pool. She told us our dad was gonna pick us up. I don‚Äôt think she knew why.

I knew SOMETHInG was up. Everything seemed wrong. I thought maybe great grandma was sick, and possibly even dead. I thought maybe some grandparent was in the hospital. Anything at all. Mom didn‚Äôt cross my mind.

We got in the car. Swimsuits still dripping. Flip flops and all. He drove down the street, past our old house, and went down the dead end street with the old abandoned park at the end.

When the car turned right to go down that road, I knew where we were going. Something was up. He had some news to tell us.

We parked and he got out of the car and he sat on the concrete cylinder pipe painted bright red and blue. The ones we used to climb on as kids.

I got out of the car but just stood there. Frozen. Then I remembered the text from grandad. I wondered if mom was sick. But I was prepared for him to tell me my great grandmother died.

My dad told my sister and I to come closer. My feet were heavy and unable to move, but I did. And he started crying. My stepmom stood by the tree next to the car.

He asked if I‚Äôd heard anything from grandad. And in that moment he started crying. And I started crying. And he said, ‚ÄúGirls, your mom, she passed away.‚Äù

And I

Died.

I didn‚Äôt know I could produce that many tears at once. They came out. Hot and heavy, in desperation. In agony. I turned around and fell to the earth. Rocks and twigs dug into my bare knees. And I curled up and cried.

Then this fucking hand was on my shoulder. It was bony. It was my stepmoms hand. And I stood up. Tears still flowing like a waterfall. But I was expressionless.

But still they poured.

My sister was clinging to my father.

I got back in the car.

And sat there.

I stopped crying.

Eventually everyone got back in.

I stared out the window. I tried to keep calm. I asked when, how, where, etc.

And we went home.

It was an hour or two before church.

My dad asked if we wanted to go, expecting a no.

But I said yes. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone. Not with my family.

And I thought I‚Äôd be fine. I joked around with my friends even. But it wasn‚Äôt until he started the sermon the tears came out. No one noticed, I think.

I was a silent sobber.

I cried that entire hour.

I sobered up for small groups.

And towards the end. She asked if we had prayer requests, or someone asked if I was okay or something. And I told them.

My mom died.

And I just cried and cried and cried. Everyone fucking hugged me‚Äî held my hand, put a hand on my shoulder.

It was uncomfortable. But at least someone knew.

And Alyssa prayed for me.

Anyways.

I‚Äôm a fucking mess now.

I‚Äôve tried to repress that day.

That place. That park and our old house.

For the next 5 months I recalled every memory I had of my mom. Everything reminded me of her. And anything that did made me cry.

It got bad when school started. At the very mention of the word ‚Äúmom,‚Äù a stray tear would form.

But in October.

We were on a field trip. With the art class. With F.  On a big yellow school bus. I was sitting next to log. We passed the old community where that park was, my old house. Literally every store on that street sent memories I thought I‚Äôd forgotten flying back into my head. And I just cried.

I held it in. I kind of disassociated during the field trip. I barely remember where it was to.

But on the trip back. I lost it. I silently cried the whole way back. No one noticed, and if Log did, he had come to expect that from me by now.

But F noticed. He saw. I think we made eye contact, even 5 rows behind him. I immediately looked away and hid my crying.

But he didn‚Äôt say anything.

And when we got back to school. I went to the bathroom, and banged my head on a wall and cried. Eventually when the halls had cleared a bunch, I left to sneak back into the classroom to grab my backpack. It was a Friday and MYM club was meeting. I snuck in. F noticed me, and I grabbed my bag and left. As I was leaving the room I noticed him get up and head towards me as I left the room. I pretended not to notice.

I had made it out into the hall when he came out of the room a few moments after I did. He called to me, asked if I was okay. We stood so close, right outside his class.

He asked if I was okay, he said he saw me crying on the bus. He asked if something happened on the field trip.

I said no no no. I said I was sorry over and over and over.

He asked what was wrong and I could NOT get the words out of my mouth.

Eventually he just waited for me to explain, and I just said it was hard to go by there again.

He looked confused, I said the town name to clarify.

I said I was sorry a bunch more and teared up.

He asked if I wanted a hug.

I said sure.

And he hugged me. Not for more than two or three seconds.

But someone hugged me.

I hadn‚Äôt been sincerely hugged in forever. Maybe ever.

He asked if I was gonna be ok. I said I was fine and I left and disappeared down the hall.

And I think it was that moment, I became obsessed with him. I needed him to understand my emotional pain. I needed him to know about my mom.

I became so alone and depressed the next few weeks. I cried so much. I was empty. I just looked sad all day long.

But I wanted him to know my emotional pain, because he healed it. When he asked me what was wrong and hugged me. I felt healing. For the first time, from anyone.

And I tried every day to show him my sadness. I LONGED for him to ask me again what was wrong. But being overtly depressed every day just drew him further from me, because I drew so far into myself.

But he made me laugh, and smile, like no other person. He made ME, of all students, feel like I mattered.

And I looked up to him so much.

But no matter how I presented myself, happy, or sad, he never asked what was wrong, and if he did, it was in front of people, or I just said I was fine.

And day as soon as I left the room, I cried because of how awful I was.

I started hating myself. I felt so alone. And I cut myself for the first time.

And in the next two months my self harm got worse and worse and worse. I‚Äôd go home and cut on 90% of days.

And this just made me even more alone. F didn‚Äôt know about my mom. He doesn‚Äôt know how sad I am. He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve been cutting myself because of how stupid and lonely I feel.

I just became obsessed with the goal of showing to him how sad I was. I just wanted him to ask me what was wrong, and tell him about my dead mom.

I‚Äôd go to the cafeteria every day at a precise time when I knew he‚Äôd be there. I got to class on time. I stayed for all clubs. I stayed after school as many days as I could find the excuse to. I even would sit and wait for sometimes an hour out on the steps after school just waiting for him to drive by and wave to me sitting there.

But after months of staying after school almost every day, doing everything I could to help, and spend time in that room, he grew to really trust and rely on me. I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre friends. Not in the way I am with my buddies, but he‚Äôs a friend in the sense a mentor might be.

Sometime somehow he must‚Äôve put the pieces together about my mom. I don‚Äôt know the exact moment. But I know he knows now. I think.

I just don‚Äôt know if he knows how or when. But he‚Äôs gonna know tomorrow because I‚Äôm 100% putting something on my close friends story. Which is literally only him.

Not because he‚Äôs my only close friend. But because I can communicate stuff that seems like I‚Äôm telling everyone but only him.

And he knows about my mom, but I don‚Äôt feel that much better. I do. But I don‚Äôt.

He knows that I cut myself.

Well I convinced him that I used to. That I‚Äôve stopped.

But when he found out I thought I‚Äôd fucked what we had up. But I think it just made our understanding of each other better.

I kind of wish he would ask me if I ever went to see a therapist/counselor so I can tell him I didn‚Äôt.

Maybe then he will realize I haven‚Äôt stopped.

..

Well this wasn‚Äôt much of a diary entry. Just a long story of me being needy.

But I am needy.

I need people. I need him.

I think I‚Äôve moved on from that sad, neediness I had this school year. Especially this last month.

He literally gave me a ride home to my grandmas that day I offered to help him set up the art fair

He confides in me sometimes.

He tells ME first when he‚Äôs got some new idea or plan for something related to the class/school/whatever.

I‚Äôm really happy I‚Äôve been able to get out of that depression.

I‚Äôm not cured.

By no means.

But he is and has been my medicine."

Just been busy whole day with Eid shopping and stuff . Its been whole Ramadan I barely took any class but hopeful to cover it after Eid vacations .

The day was tiring and really hot today .
I was just surfing on my institutes website and found the results came out but thank God it was not mine but I know a person who gave the exams and once was really close to my heart ...

Damn man !!! Everything triggers me again and nostalgia really hits hard and I kept thinking about that time ."
0,"02.06.19. The fortune teller
I went on a trip with my family last summer.

One evening, we were wandering around an ancient, spiritual sector of the city, when we met a man.

I wish I could remember what he called himself.

All I remember is asking him: ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a fortune teller?‚Äù

And he said: ‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù

Then he pulled out a deck of small cards and told me to pick one. He said it would reveal a truth about my spirit.

(Or something similar. I wish I could remember better.)

I asked him, ‚ÄúHow much for this?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free.‚Äù

So I picked a card.

The card said: ◊ô◊ï◊§◊ô

It translates to ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù- inner and outer.

The man looked at me and said: ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù

For a moment, I believed him.

Then my mom said: ‚ÄúWhat? It doesn‚Äôt suit you at all! Give that one to your sister and pick another.‚Äù

So I did.

The second time, I got ‚ÄúSimplicity‚Äù.

The man said: ‚ÄúThis card is for someone who appreciates the simple things. They need little, and live modestly.‚Äù

My mom said: ‚ÄúSee? That one‚Äôs much better for you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs true; I don‚Äôt need much.

But... I wanted to be beautiful.

I wish my mom had let me keep the card."
0,"02.06.19. Feelings
Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm a psychopath.

I can turn my feelings off.

I just tell myself: *Stop.*

And then I do.

My sister used to come to me crying whenever someone hurt her.

My advice was: ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt let it affect you.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how feelings work!‚Äù

And she would cry some more.

Eventually, I learned that the right thing to do was just sit and listen, and try my best to simply understand what she was feeling, rather than tell her to stop.

...But I had to google it.

I never understood why she didn‚Äôt just stop feeling, if it was something that bothered her.

She never understood what the fuck I was talking about. Her feelings didn‚Äôt work like that.

In time, I learned that most people‚Äôs don‚Äôt.

Then last year, I learned that mine don‚Äôt, either.

And I got pushed over the edge, and everything hit me all at once.

I couldn‚Äôt stop feeling.

So I did drugs.

Weed, acid, shrooms, coke, pills, whatever.

Sometimes, I did it to numb my feelings.

Sometimes, I did it to feel anything at all.

And sometimes, I just did it because I was bored.

But no substance in the world could keep me from falling apart last year.

Nothing could stop me from feeling, no matter how hard I tried.

I was totally helpless; a slave to my own thoughts.

And I finally understood what my sister meant when she told me you can‚Äôt just shut feelings off.

So I learned to give in, to just let myself feel whatever I was going to, and ride it out until it went away on its own. Nothing lasts forever- especially not feelings.

For a while, all I did was feel.

I felt more intensely than I ever knew was even possible. I felt emotions I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

But I rode it out, and did what I could to buoy myself until the storm inside my mind passed.

And eventually, it did.

But now, I‚Äôm back where I started.

Every day, I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to do.

Then every night, I smoke weed and have a few drinks, and it keeps the feelings at bay.

All of them.

I‚Äôm numb."

(I'm going to be adding to this as an on going rant about life. Draw from it, IDC, call me out, do what ever.) (Just know, the 1st entry is from another reddit, the rant reddit, so the date for it will be older than me actually making this post on here

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{1st June, 2019}

I criticize a friend for being a druggie

Yelled at one because I'm jelouse of her

Ran one off

And just blocked another for no reason.

Now I'm pissed because I have no one to vent too, like the low life I am. Idk why I'm fucking like this, and apparently no Therapist or what ever can help me, so fuck them.

I hate everything I used to love, drawing, video games, just everything. I can't fucking be normal.

I want to do drugs to get my mind off it, but I hate drugs, as they fucked over my family, and are why I'm here today.

I can't tell if my problem is not being able to follow my dreams (cross-dressing, and becoming a feminine male), have my own privacy, my past, or the fact I chose people like me as friends, and then treat the good people like shit, like they're worthless.

One friend, she's so sweet, but I just yell at her, because I'm so angry. For all I know, rn, she could be fucking dead, and the last thing I've said to her ""is fuck off""

I don't know what to use, I can't excuse myself, but if I just back down, I'll look confused, and I don't like that

I don't get why all these people can find love 'n shit. Why? Why do I always get stuck in the long distance relationship, with somebody that smokes pot and drinks Alcholol, barely even talks to me, and rely on them to help me.

Why can't I go church? I keep getting told god can help me, but rn he isn't...but I feel like if I turn on him now, I'll be fucked even more

I go to some group that's ment To help me handle this all, but I just feel like everyone else, some depressed asshole, who blames everyone. I'm a Hippocrate.

I debated doing drugs today, seeing how chill my friend was, then yelled at him for it...

One of my only irl friends is leaving, well, has left today, and won't be back for a month. He cares about me as a friend, and is chill, he's like me, except not an asshole

Idk what to do, hell, I'll probably delete this shit.

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{2nd June, 2019}

My partner and I got into an argument over hormones. I just want to be more feminine. I'm tired of looking masculine. But this seemed to have rubbed her the wrong way. So now she's drunk, and just degrading me...

But I deserve it...maybe it'd be best I just died in a whole, maybe...maybe not...my dog would be sad, but he probably doesn't care either, just sees me at the human who feeds him and lets him shit.

I don't want to get religious, but maybe God is telling me something...maybe he's telling me to fucking stop. Just end it. Or maybe stop, and just be normal... I'm not sure. But what ever it is, I'd much rather be dead right now than what I'm feeling. I'm so tired. I don't want to kill myself directly. Maybe a bus hitting me, or a robber shooting me? Something normal. I mean, if I have to, I'll off myself, but it's not preferred...

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{5th June, 2019}

I'm doing a bit better. Currently taking a day off from walking, as it rained today, so no working out for this boio. I wanted to give some insight to myself.

I'm a male, but I enjoy being small, feminine, and am a bottom. I'm pretty much Into anything that has a dick, or can have a strap-on, and is dominant in bed. I'm not just sexual though, and am pretty complex when it comes to love, yet pretty simple. But the sex part of my love life is easier to explain.

Crossdressing boy, who looks feminine, but has a dicc, likes it up the ass from dominant partners.

Basically, my current partner is a mistress of sorts ...it started off as a slave type rp, just for fun, but it grew into our conversation as well...we got to know.kore about each other, and I think I'm in love with her. She and I don't wanna be too rash, as we're long distance, but she is like me, and is jelouse, and a little possessive. Not creepy ""you can't see your family"" possessive, just we hate cheating, and the thought of it, and will tell each other if someone tries to get us to cheat. We're also pretty open to each other about knowing who we talk to, and aren't weird about letting us see our phones, unless it's a personal family matter.

But all that's just side talk.

Yesterday, she and I got to talking. I was calm, and so was she...

We talked, and honestly, I feel stupid saying all that shit the other day... I'm just weird I guess...well, not weird, just a fucking jerk.

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

{8th June, 2019}

She accused me of cheating. Why? Because I thought she wanted to do a job Biology related. She told me to fuck off and to go to my biology hoe. So I fucked off. I am now wanting to end it all, but all I can think of is how my grandma and dog would react."

It‚Äôs so late. But I‚Äôll recap.

Woke up late.

I think I read for a little bit. Maybe.

I know we went to the car dealership.

We‚Äôve had this piece of junk for 10 years, and it‚Äôs time to get another.

I was 7 when I was there last.

Funny how time flies. Lives change.

We ate at Schlotzkys or however it‚Äôs spelled. Which was like a fuckin‚Äô flashback to being 7 again. We used to eat there with dad, AND mom.

Separate of course. But there.

Went to P and S‚Äôs grad party. Ate some fruit, socialized a bit.

P dared me to take a bite out of an onion as if it were an apple. I did.

I can still taste it.

My parents were looking at Honda Pilots.

F drives a Honda Pilot.

Oh yeah.. F.

I sent him a message, I‚Äôll just paste it. I‚Äôm too tired to write/summarize.

‚ÄúHey I was just wondering if there were any days you were going to be at school working on stuff sometime in the next 3 weeks, if I could stop by and use the ferric chloride/press. I promise I‚Äôll try and stay out of the way! It probably won‚Äôt take me very long to do what I need to do.

I‚Äôve ordered some stuff I think is the solution to all the issues I‚Äôve been having with printing, and It‚Äôd be really helpful to test it out before I go and spend a lot of time etching a bunch of plates. (Just in case this ground is a dud as well.)

But if you‚Äôre not gonna be in the classroom any time this month, or you‚Äôd rather just work alone, it‚Äôs totally cool and I can wait till later! Just let me know. Thanks!‚Äù

And to which he replied,

‚ÄúSure! I think I am going to try to go Thursday. Let me see what‚Äôs happening this week and I‚Äôll let you know for sure. Actually, I was thinking I could probably use an assistant for some things I‚Äôm doing this summer. I‚Äôll let you know. I wouldn‚Äôt need your help the whole time, so you could do your thing too. ‚Äú

And to which I responded,

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to help out with anything I can! And well I just ordered the stuff yesterday, so I‚Äôm hoping it will arrive in the next 2-3 days. So I‚Äôm hoping it all gets here before at least Wednesday, which I‚Äôm sure it will. But if you‚Äôre going to try and be at school Thursday, that would be awesome!
Thanks a billion!‚Äù

And he said,

‚ÄúCool. Thanks. I‚Äôll keep in touch.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm realizing I should have worded things differently.

Anyways. After dinner I got really sad

Boo hoooo

I cut myself in the bathtub and watched the blood drip drip drip onto the tub floor. Then I did the other leg and took a shower.

I talked to some kid who kind of reminds me of me when I was 14. She‚Äôs nice. Just a little naive. I feel bad for her.

I think I read some more somwhere in the day bbut I can‚Äôt remember.

I wrote a poem too. It‚Äôs got its own post.

I wish I could tell him what I wrote.

But maybe that‚Äôs too far.

A lot happened today.

Some good, some bad, some in-between.

There were so many little adventures; so much I could write about.

I can‚Äôt think of what to say.

So much happens all the time.

But when I sit down and try to write it all out like a normal fucking diary entry, my mind goes blank.

I don‚Äôt know how to recap my day.

...

That was gonna be the end of my entry. But then right before I hit the ‚Äúpost‚Äù button, my housemate came in.

He said: ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou were gone all day.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúWell, you were out at some point.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúUm... I went to Tim Horton‚Äôs.‚Äù

I tried to think of more.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

Luckily, my housemate filled the silence.

He said: ‚ÄúYou kind of blink in and out of existence, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt make a single sound all day. I didn‚Äôt know you were home.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWell, I was out for some of it. Like, I just got home.‚Äù

But it was 9:30 at night. I knew I hadn‚Äôt just come from a coffee shop.

Where had I been all day?

I know I had a full day. I know I did stuff.

What did I do?

Obviously, I know where I was and what I did all day.

If I really think about it, the details are there.

But it‚Äôs like I only live from one moment to the next.

I‚Äôm running on autopilot.

Or maybe I‚Äôm just running.

It‚Äôs like my housemate said.

I kind of just blink in and out of existence."

0,"A false beginning
I am almost exactly where I wanted to be... yet something seems a little off.

&#x200B;

I wanted to improve my GPA and so I did, although not as much as I had planned, but nevertheless I did not fall much short from my original goal.

&#x200B;

I had been eagerly waiting for finals week to end so that I could finally see her again. But as soon as  they ended, my overwhelming desire to rush back to her wilted as with the same intensity as it has surfaced. I decided to not go and see her, Don't get me wrong, I still have a MAJOR crush on her. But something feels different and I can not put my finger on it.

&#x200B;

Then fate decided to drag me back from Karachi and shoved my in her lap. It was oblivion for exactly 5 hours. After that the oblivion faded away. I yearned for her yet I did not feel like being in her presence (Although there was no way around it). We fell asleep same bed but the distance between our bodies and the prying eyes of the world made it seem like we were on completely different hemispheres of the Earth. Heck her hand was barely a few millimeters from mine yet my hand could not extend and embrace hers.

&#x200B;

It is as if she has drifted apart but in a different way. I have better conversations with her than ever before. She initiates conversations more than ever. She shows that she understands me more than she has ever shown. I yearn for her more than I ever have. Sometimes all my mind agrees on doing is  fixating upon how soft, warm and captivating her naked body would feel. How homely and comforting her gentle touches would be and how rich her laugh would be in the absence of any other entity except ours. Yet, I feel she is further away from me than she has ever been. Every time I look at her, I am reminded of how unnecessary my affection is for her. TBH, I have never admired and envied anyone as much before. I want to be like her. I want to learn to live life in the same carefree and optimistic way that she does. I want to have that unwavering faith in myself just like she has.

&#x200B;

It is the 27th night of Ramadan and she is upstairs praying to God. And here I am, a closeted agnostic, a self-proclaimed smartass with nothing to show for it, a recipient of favors that I do not feel deserving of, a hopeless romantic that has nothing of significance to contribute to anyone's life. The only thing I carry is the promise to improve in great strides and the shit-tonne of uncertainty that is naturally associated with any and all such promises.

&#x200B;

I want that completeness, that iron dome of immunity from the opinions and actions of the world just like she has. Do I love her? Or am I just entranced by how much she resembles my ideal self? She is already where I want to be. Would my ideal self ever romantically love someone who was behind in the journey? I feel like I should be able to answer that question but I am not certain. I am not certain because I am afraid the real answer might very well be ""no"".

&#x200B;

What stops me from confessing to her? The unimaginable distances. The fact that if she rejects me I would still have to keep seeing her, her family and pretend everything is fine. I am BAD at acting. I am bad at keeping my discomfort within the confines of my heart.

I‚Äôm so fucking exhausted. Today was pretty cool until about 20 minutes ago. I went rummage sailing with my parents which usually isn‚Äôt a good thing but I got three plants and a pair of shorts so it was a pretty good day to me and my parents bought me breakfast. It‚Äôs so crazy that the donut üç© shop that has been ran by the same people my entire life has just changed. So stupid to care about something like that but idk I don‚Äôt feel as welcome there now but the food is better so whatever I‚Äôm a brat I guess on the way home everything was going great. I guess it was too great because my dad started in on me how I‚Äôm stupid and don‚Äôt know anything about the world says the guy who is on welfare but is against socialism like tf you‚Äôre so fucking stupid but I can‚Äôt seriously listen to a guy who voted for a rapist so I should‚Äôve known it wasn‚Äôt going to end well. Whatever I‚Äôm still pretty pissed that podcast I‚Äôve been listening to was really nice to escape my family with not hearing half of what they say really improves my mood"

Annnnd it‚Äôs already Friday night.

This week went by fast.

But so does every week, so what‚Äôs new?

Also random side note, I‚Äôve been reading the notes I‚Äôve made in the notes app and I found a TON of freaky ass dreams I have barely any recollection of.

Dreams about bathroom crockpots, skinny birds, and F, and Wendy‚Äôs, and F again. Weird shit.

F shows up a lot in my dreams. Which I‚Äôm not mad about. I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs changed. For a long time when he‚Äôd appear in my dreams he was unnaturally hostile, then he would ignore me.

It‚Äôs different now. But I‚Äôd like to think our relationship is different.

Or maybe the underlying relationship to myself has changed. Maybe I don‚Äôt hate my guts as much anymore. Maybe my mental health has improved.

Speaking of hating my guts and F, I posted some dumb pics of me being stupid and said something edgy like

‚ÄúI literally hate myself so much.
Can someone surgically remove my brain because it‚Äôs being rlly mean lately >:-(‚Äú

And F responded. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre swell.‚Äù

Just that. While I was at work.

My heart melted a bit but I was too busy taking inventory/answering the phone/taking orders all at once.

I fuckin love that man. He‚Äôs like my dad who‚Äôs not my dad. He‚Äôs just fucking great‚Äî beyond great! He‚Äôs perfect, yet perfectly imperfect.

He‚Äôs been there for me when I literally wanted to die. He‚Äôs been there for me when I felt useless, he‚Äôs been there for me when I felt like I was annoying him. He‚Äôs been there for me when I‚Äôve been stupid. He‚Äôs been there for me even after he found out I‚Äôve been fucking cutting myself. He‚Äôs been there for me when I felt uninspired. He‚Äôs ALWAYS been there for me. Maybe not so much the last two years, but I barely had his class.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without him. He‚Äôs a father figure, and a mentor, yet a friend. He inspires me to go above and beyond. But is never disappointed with me when I slip up. He‚Äôs the only serious artist I know in my life who isn‚Äôt some flamboyant annoying fuck. I love him.

Anyways. Enough of me gushing about my fuckin‚Äô art teacher for today.

...

Today was okay.

I didn‚Äôt get out of bed until 10.

I was fairly productive for an hour and a half. Ordered some much needed art supplies. Ordered two new books with my gift card from my birthday. Both books by the co-authors of art and fear.

I finally wrote Grammy back. I just gave her my address and said hi.

I cleaned my room too. Which didn‚Äôt take long. My room is so empty, it‚Äôs hard to not keep clean.

I ate some lunch, then some more food. So much for starting my diet. After that I watched a new episode of the new Twilight Zone.

After that I went outside and drew a little bit came back in after a short time because I was being bit by bugs.

Eventually I got ready for work, and did that.

Today was boring.

I read more of art and fear for a while.

My brain is shutting down.

Basically. I miss F.

I miss my friends a lot too.

But I miss him most of all.

I really wonder if I‚Äôm mentally ill.

If you asked me now. I‚Äôd say no.

But take one look at my diary, or one look into my head and my emotions. I probably am.

Just today I considered dropping my clean streak and slicing up my thighs to high heaven.

I really want to. Just one at least.

Or to pick at scabs.

It just disgusts me when I have to look at my thighs on the toilet.

Scars that look like gaping wounds. Still dark pink‚Äî almost red.

Scars that look like...  cuts.

I wish the whole world didn‚Äôt fucking care and I could walk around and have them invisible to others.

0,"31.05.19. A river called Denial
I did a lot of research on abuse.

Went on a Google deep-dive. Even posted a couple questions on some Internet forums.

And what I learned is this:

When someone‚Äôs being abused, on a deeper, fundamental level they already know that something is wrong. Even when they seem completely oblivious, deep down, they know.

I learned a lot about abuse.

There were a lot of things I recognized, things I didn‚Äôt even know counted as being bad.

‚ÄúAbuse‚Äù is kind of a strong word.

But when I read that little paragraph, it hit me.

Deep down, I already knew.

Something is wrong with my family."

It was another plain depressing day.

I went to the bank to get money for my weekly rent. I went out to eat at a restaraunt for lunch and then i went to walmart.

At walmart i got some bodywash, new work shoes and a foot roller for my feet to massage it. I was gonna get this portable evaporative cooler but it was gonna make me go over budget so ill get it another time.

Then i went to aldi's and got a few things.
While i was waiting for the bus, i met someone new. We chatted for a bit and exchanged snapchat usernames. He lives two towns over from me and he is not my type but he probably not gay. I could use another friend tho.

I took my first quiz in one of my new classes and got a B. Hooray. I have a two page essay that i have write about myself. That requires alot of brain juice so i have to prepare for that. My english class will make me write so much more. I dont know if i can handle it.

While i was sitting in my pity puddle, there was something from the college brochure that stuck out. It said that i dont have to keep my current job just to go to the free online school. It means i can free myself. Only thing i worry about is being able to catch on with what to do at a job and transportation. It is what always stop me.

Tomorrow or technically today, i plan on seeing my older sister that lives in an assistive living home. It will be nice out so ill dress comfortably."

Sometimes I forget what happens in a day until I go to write it all down and it all comes flooding back. If we just take the time to remember, most of the time, the memory is right there.

I woke up. God dressed. Felt a little edgy and wore my shorts and striped shirt and some dark makeup.

I ended up just feeling really fat today.

Some days I just feel fatter than others.

I catch a glimpse of myself walking in front of a reflective window and see how fucking big my torso is.

I REALLY need to lose weight.

I just need to control my diet. If I can control my productivity, I can control what I eat.

Mind over matter.

Anyways. Ate a fucking McDonald‚Äôs breakfast. Went over to grandmas and we talked about shopping. Go figure.

We went to Dick‚Äôs. My sister looked for some shorts. I looked around secretly hoping to find some longer cycling shorts or something. I realized I needed at least ONE pair of shorts that can get wet at camp.

I tried on a pair and I just felt fat.

It‚Äôs hard to shop when you just feel fat and gross.

We left there and went to the shoe store. I was kind of turned off by it all. Shoe shopping isn‚Äôt very fun. I‚Äôd rather order something online, and besides, my heart is set on those doc martens.

I did get a pair of socks that have cherry pies on them. They‚Äôre super cute. That made me feel a little better. I may be fat, but I‚Äôve got cute socks!

We went to the thrift store after that. I always gravitate to the same clothes. I bought some of what I usually end up getting.

I did get this nice faded orange pink linen shirt that I can‚Äôt wait to wear. And some funky earrings.

We tried to find a place to eat, and it turned into a fucking nightmare because of my sister. It‚Äôs so hard to find somewhere to eat with her fucking picky ass palate.

I hate her guts sometimes. We‚Äôve been fighting a ton more recently.

In the car ride there, F messaged the group chat more about the Santa Fe trip. He said the price was likely to be around 1,300$ instead of 1,000$. Shit.

I eventually figured out that I‚Äôd just not dye my hair at the salon anymore and I could save some of the extra money there.

Then he was saying he really needed 10 people to go or else the trip was going to be a lot more expensive per person, plus he couldn‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôd all get on the same flight.

Only 6-7 people responded to say that they would come if they could afford it. Two for sure said yes. (Me and M.)

I DMed him about something related to it and all hope isn‚Äôt lost. He‚Äôs not going to give up. ‚ÄúNot by a long shot.‚Äù

Later in the day he texted the whole group again and said that he‚Äôd talked to a school administrator and we should probably have a meeting about it soon, before the end of the month.

We went back to grandmas after lunch.

I‚Äôm so grateful for my grandma. I love her so much. I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to afford the clothes I really needed this summer, and she said she‚Äôd order them for me. EVEN the doc martens. (They‚Äôre sandals, not 200$ boots haha.)

On the drive back to our house, I got super tired out of nowhere. I barely made it in the house.

After I got inside I saw how nice the sun looked outside and I decided if I were going to rest, I might as well do it out in the sun. So I slathered on some sunscreen and put a towel out on the patio and just listened to podcasts for an hour and a half.

My sister eventually joined me, but she put on her whole fucking swimsuit. I was just out there in my T-shirt and jean shorts. Literally the only skin exposed to the sun on me was my arms, just past my elbow, my legs past my knees, and my face.

I‚Äôm gonna end up with a weird tan eventually.

Maybe. I don‚Äôt know if I tan. I‚Äôve never tried. I‚Äôm always a pale ghost, or bob the tomato. Never in between.

So that‚Äôs one of my goals this summer. Get tan.

After laying out in the sun cooking for an hour and a half, I felt heavy and sweaty so I took a cold shower.

After that I had some dinner and after dinner I talked with my stepmom for over an hour almost.

We talked about college, and sales, and the future. And jobs and money and adult life.

She basically started to sell me on being a salesperson. They make GOOD money at her company. It would be a great job. If I got hired there, I could be living on my own and pay off my student debt at the same time. Over a few years of course.

She thought I‚Äôd be good at sales. Really anyone can be.

Anyways, I won‚Äôt type out the entire convo.

I basically decided that I want to go to art college because I know it‚Äôs what I want to do throughout my life, even if it‚Äôs not my main source of income. And that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôve always been okay with that.

But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I want to learn as much about art as I can.

So after that long, inspiring, but draining conversation, I went back to my room and decided to go on a walk.

I walked down to the little shopping area near my house. Walked in the grocery store and up and down the isles, and then left without a thing.

Then I fucking went to McDonald‚Äôs and bought some chicken nuggets like the fat ass I am.

Honestly out of everything embarrassing I‚Äôve ever written in this damn diary, that takes the cake by far.

I walked back home and sat down at my desk and started to read my book but I only made it two pages in before my brain gave up.

I then made a packing list of what I‚Äôm going to bring to art camp this July.

I thought I didn‚Äôt have the energy to write tonight, but I guess I was wrong.

I‚Äôm gonna sleep good tonight.

Tomorrow maybe I‚Äôll start on some art."
0,"30.05.19. Today, I woke up happy
Mornings are tough for me.

My life is so full of chaos. My days are all so unpredictable.

So most mornings, when I wake up, I have no idea how the day will go.

Will I have a good day? A bad day?

It‚Äôs impossible to predict.

And it makes me miserable.

Because most days, I have no idea what to expect.

I know how many problems I already have. I know how often new problems come up. And I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take.

Most mornings, I wake up and wish I hadn‚Äôt.

Usually, when I wake up, I‚Äôm already exhausted.

Sometimes it feels like life has really put me through the ringer. And it feels so unfair that I have to keep trying to handle whatever life wants to throw at me. It feels like the hits just keep coming.

But this morning, I woke up happy.

I still don‚Äôt know what to expect.

But today, I know I can take it.

And I‚Äôm excited to try."

0,"9:33 PM 5/29/19
I made myself wait to the end of the day, and I‚Äôm glad.

I woke up at 6 this morning. I dreamt of something or another. Something insignificant that will probably be explored again by my subconscious if I dream tonight.

I woke up at 6, but didn‚Äôt get up until 9. I took a shower, and somehow managed to do nothing but fuck around on my phone until 11.

I ate some leftover spaghetti for lunch. Watched some dumb ass Jim Carrey movie, Yesman. It wasn‚Äôt good, AT ALL. I hope I never remember that movie.

I sat around some more and finally stopped procrastinating and go work on some figure/gesture drawings. I‚Äôm really trying to say no to procrastination ‚Äî as much as Jim Carrey says yes to life, I say no to my lazy desires.

I sat down at my desk with the comfortingly simple notepad my grandma gave me. Nothing fancy at all. Just plain, notebook paper.

I watched a video and a half on the theory and technique of gesture drawing and realized that I just had to fucking do it if I wanted to understand it.

I found a website that has free images, and literally sketched my worse. It was like exercising my some distant brain and hand muscle I‚Äôve barely tapped into before. It was rewarding, and fun to explore.

There‚Äôs a greater wonder and magic in learning to make art rather than finish a long slaved over piece. (For me anyways.)

My first drawings were literal dog shit, and I crumpled them up and threw them into a pile on my desk. But when I finished a second sheet, I crumpled it up not solely because I was embarrassed by it, but because these drawings DO NOT MATTER. They are the result of exercise. The sweat of artmaking. You wouldn‚Äôt bottle and frame the sweat from a workout?

(Although THAT would sure be an innovative art piece!)

I finally stopped after a while. I definitely stopped too soon, but early enough for my brain to not get so bored with it.

In the end I threw all of the sketches away and kept the last one I did for reference when I practice again. Hopefully soon.

Here is a picture of four of the sheets in progression from first to last. [https://prnt.sc/nv77og](https://prnt.sc/nv77og)

Hard to see, but that‚Äôs what I get for crumpling them up.

Anywhoo.. after that I got dressed because people were coming over to sign for the car. It was an odd experience. I had to do the writing. I sold it to some 22 year old who graduated from the same high school I go to.

My dad kept trying to make smalltalk with her dad about the tornado yesterday.

And there it was. 2k in cash. In my hands. The most money I‚Äôve ever held at once.

It was weird. Saying goodbye. Although I didn‚Äôt really get a chance. I force myself to not be sentimental about mom around my dad.

Speaking of which. I haven‚Äôt replied to my moms mom. I don‚Äôt want to, but I should. Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow or Friday.

After the car business was over, I dicked around the house for three hours until it was time for church. My sister has been driving me insane lately. She‚Äôs SO mean sometimes. She does this thing where she won‚Äôt admit she‚Äôs ever wrong. She‚Äôll lie about her contractions and even lie about lying, and then make ME look like the dumbass. I really DO NOT like that.

She‚Äôs always loved picking fights and trying to get reactions from me, but I really fucking hate when she acts like she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs doing.

Dad made oven raviolis and I sat down with mine on a plate waiting for the sauce to be finished microwaving. My sister brought out the sauce ‚Äî and she does these tiny little things to piss me off, like when carrying the hot bowl with oven mitts to the table, your first response would be to set down the bowl on the table right?

But noooo, she had to hold the fuckin‚Äô bowl and try to pull out the chair with her elbows. JUST SO I COULDN‚ÄôT touch the sauce.

Then she sat down and when she was removing the bowl from under the hot plate, she moved the bowl directly next to her between her plate and the empty plate next to hers.

We ALWAYS put the bow in the middle. It makes natural sense. But she FUCKING PUT THE BOWL RIGHT THERE.

And when I pointed it out to her, instead of saying hey I can‚Äôt reach the sauce, I said L can‚Äôt reach the sauce because she was sitting right next to me. And my sister was like, but L isn‚Äôt eating raviolis all innocent like, knowing full well I‚Äôve been waiting for her to bring the sauce to the table.

I just fucking LOST it. The tears started flowing out from my eyes fast and hot and I just yelled at her with a genuinely hurt voice and took my food to my room.

She‚Äôs so fucking cruel sometimes, and she always wonders why I hate her. She always wonders why I think she‚Äôs dumb. BECAUSE SHE FUCKING IS!

She‚Äôs done things like this all week, it‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt get enough attention from the friends she FaceTimes all day, and is doing so as I type at fuckin‚Äô 10 PM.

Anyways. I cooled down a tiny bit and we went to church. We played 9 square. I was average. We found out our team for camp. We‚Äôre the black team. Black Panther themed. Great! üôÑ
I tripped on the concrete and skinned my toe and knee and hand and landed hard on my butt. When I fall, it‚Äôs like a fucking skyscraper going down‚Äî tall and heavy.

Later after church we went back out to play more 9 square and I was fuckin killing it! I‚Äôve never been so good, I finally figured out the best technique to get people out. I felt proud that people recognized I was doing well.

I‚Äôm still mad at my sister, but I‚Äôm going to be the adult here. She makes herself look dumb all the time. I don‚Äôt need to do anything to make that happen. And when it happens. I stay silent.

When I got home I went to my room and sat at my desk and read more from Art & Fear. I reread the chapter on teaching, and read some new chapters towards the end. I underlined some stuff too. I‚Äôve never done that with a book before on my own.

Then I found a stopping place so I could go write my diary entry for the day then go to sleep.

So goodnight world."

0,"29.05.19. Every flavour Oreo
I have a new mission in life.

At the local supermarket near my house one day, I discovered an entire shelf wall full of different Oreo flavours, sizes, thicknesses, and colours.

I had never seen so much Oreo variety before.

I was immediately enthralled.

Every now and then I‚Äôd show it to a friend, and they would be equally surprised at the sheer mass of different kinds of Oreos right there under our noses.

I became determined to try them all at least once.

So from then on, every time we ran out of Oreos, I‚Äôd buy a new flavour.

It was fun the first few times.

Then I got depressed and forgot about it.

Until today, when I stumbled upon a package of Coconut-Flavoured Oreo Thins in our pantry. I couldn‚Äôt believe they survived the move.

(We lost so many important things when we moved. But we held onto the coconut flavoured Oreos.)

Anyways, today I tried coconut flavoured Oreos.

They were surprisingly good.

I gave some to a friend and she agreed.

So we got to talking, and she asked me why I even bought those to begin with, so I told her about the shelf in the grocery store and my whole mission.

Then I declared: ‚ÄúNext time I‚Äôm buying the carrot cake flavoured ones!‚Äù

I‚Äôm gonna try every flavour Oreo.

I will not die in peace until I succeed.

And in the meantime, I have something new to try. Something exciting to look forward to.

For now, it‚Äôs Carrot Cake Flavoured Oreos.

But it makes me laugh.

Which makes me happy.

Someone told me today: ‚ÄúYou know, you seem like you‚Äôre doing a lot better lately.‚Äù

And I realized they were right.

I am."

Today was national hamburger day.

It‚Äôs not like that matters or anything, I just thought I‚Äôd start with that.

Although I did think work would be busier because of that. Maybe everyone was frightened off by the tornadoes. Business was slow tonight.

I texted Aug in the bathroom about it all. Kind of.

Long story short, my dad and sister went on the storm chase of their lives without me. I‚Äôm a bit sad. At least I won‚Äôt be exhausted tomorrow?

The tornado damage was bad north west of me. I hope no lives were lost.

I ate room temperature tacos for dinner and pondered the situation.

I talked with my step mom about my troubles in the world of art making. About this damn etching ground and shit.

That led me to go get my laptop and actually research it some more. Apparently it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have to be shipped all the way from the UK! There is a printmaking supplier in Albuquerque that sells it! I‚Äôm saved!

Thank god for the Southwest.

The Santa Fe/Albuquerque area must just be a hub for art, especially printmaking. I want to do SO much research before I go. I want to make the most of that trip, if it ends up happening.

...

My dad just came into my room and told me that he got an offer on the car. $2,000. That‚Äôs 2k I can put towards a car of my own. That helps so much. So fucking much!

I‚Äôm sad to sell moms old car. It really made me uneasy just seeing it in our driveway. Now I have to be there to sign over the car to some stranger. The car I‚Äôve had so many memories in.

Gone.

Just like mom.

But I‚Äôm trying to get over it. I‚Äôm trying to get over her. Not forget, I‚Äôll never let that happen. I just need to get over her death. And I sound selfish, and that‚Äôs OK.

Anyways, I‚Äôm going to go to bed now. Maybe I‚Äôll dream tonight!

Sweet dreams me, and anyone else who may read this. Sweet dreams to future me who someday will inevitably re read these to figure out where I fucked up.

I hope you don‚Äôt fuck things up too much. You‚Äôve got to hold onto what you‚Äôve got.

Edit:

After all that talk about moving on, I just checked my email and got an email from my moms mom.

I guess they had a family meeting and shared memories and cried and what not. They asked about me, and still think of my sister and I as family.

It‚Äôs just so hard. I don‚Äôt feel the same way about them. I‚Äôve never liked them. But they ARE family, and I love them for that.

I don‚Äôt want to think about mom.

I don‚Äôt want this to seep into my dreams.

I don‚Äôt want them in my life anymore."
0,"28.05.19. First day back from home
I had a really good day today.

I woke up feeling like shit, physically and mentally.

Yesterday I crashed and passed out before it was even dark outside. But yesterday fucking sucked.

I had full-on paranoia, worse than I‚Äôve had in a while. I felt like a lunatic.

To calm down, I tried going for a walk to the corner store for some tea. We have tea at home, but usually walking helps me calm down.

But there were more people out than usual, most of them men.

And then at the tea station, were three huge, tall, bulky, scary-looking guys. And they looked really similar to the boys...

You know which boys.

One of them had exactly the same hair- cut, colour, everything.

I almost had a meltdown right there in the store.

But I told myself I was being ridiculous, and that it‚Äôs time to overcome this bullshit. Nothing even really happened.

Plus, I was worried that if I ran, they would chase me. It‚Äôs always easier to go the path of least resistance.

So I stood right next to them and got my tea anyways.

That mindset is probably why I get raped so often.

I just can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt even puke.

By the time I left the corner store, I was in full blown fight-or-flight.

Luckily, I was already high and I‚Äôm naturally pretty good at controlling my expressions, because the absolute last thing I wanted was to have a crazy, screaming panic attack in public.

So of course some tweaker locked eyes and walked straight at me, lurching across the sidewalk like a zombie.

My fight-or-flight response is freeze, which means when I get really scared I do nothing.

It‚Äôs definitely the worst one to have.

It means I‚Äôm completely helpless.

By that point, I don‚Äôt even know what was going through my head. I was so anxious I just went on autopilot.

Until a motorcycle roared past.

The sound startled me so much I spilled my tea.

I looked like a crazy person.

I can‚Äôt believe I actually jumped. It was like I was playing a movie character with PTSD. That shit‚Äôs not real life. This isn‚Äôt my real life.

How can that have happened to me?

By the time I made it home I was a wreck.

I even accidentally told my other housemate that I‚Äôve started doing drugs again. He was so disappointed.

Then I went right up to my room and fell asleep.

So when I woke up at 3 or 4am this morning, I wasn‚Äôt too happy about it. I was hoping to sleep forever.

But I fell back asleep a little later, and didn‚Äôt wake up again until 9 o‚Äôclock.

So I really wasn‚Äôt expecting to have a good day today.

When I woke up again, I still had all the awful thoughts from yesterday running through my head.

Plus, my stomach *really* hurt - badly enough for me to even acknowledge it. I have a really high pain tolerance, so it takes a lot for me to even notice it.

(It was probably the two plates of nachos I ate yesterday out of spite even though I‚Äôm supposed to be cutting back on gluten. Stupid fucking celiac.)

But I forgot - I had already booked math tutoring.

I was set to meet him in an hour.

Fuck.

So I told myself I would go to tutoring, finish all my online work for this week, and then I could go right back to bed.

I also told myself not to eat any gluten today.

So I rolled myself out of bed and out the door, and grabbed a piece of fruit and some coffee on the way.

Then tutoring went really well.

We even went half an hour over time to finish a tough problem, then just ended up chatting for a little while longer after that.

By the time I left, my mood had picked up.

And when I got back home, my housemates were hanging out in the kitchen. So I got another piece of fruit for a snack and stayed with them.

We had a fantastic time. I love hanging out with them.

And the fruit made my stomach stop hurting.

My housemate even told me she noticed I‚Äôve been doing a lot better with school and doing all my work. I haven‚Äôt missed any deadlines so far or anything.

She said she can see how hard I‚Äôm trying. And that she can also see how much better I‚Äôve gotten.

That made me feel really, *really* good.

Then - Drew showed up. Uninvited. Again.

But this time, my friends were there, too. So I finally mustered up the courage to tell him to leave and to stop coming to my house without permission.

And he left!!

He even texted me an apology after.

Although, he also texted me to make plans. And to guilt-trip me for not responding to his other texts.

You win some, you lose some.

Then I bought groceries while my housemates cleaned the house. It was a win-win for everyone, since they like cleaning and I like running errands.

The weather was cold and grey, but not rainy.

That‚Äôs my favourite weather!

What can I say? Maybe I‚Äôm just a weirdo.

But I love the cold, because it keeps me awake. When it gets too hot, I zone out. And I don‚Äôt like when it‚Äôs too bright outside, because my eyes are sensitive.

On the way home, one of the grocery bags broke and stuff fell all over the place.

But right away, a really nice lady gave me a new one. Not even a plastic one! She gave me a reusable bag, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it breaking again.

She swore up and down she just got it for free and didn‚Äôt even use it before I let her give it to me.

That made my whole day!

Overall, today has been great.

I love days like this, because they‚Äôre the kind of days that feel like they can happen again. I want all of my days to be like this. Or at least, like, most of them.

I‚Äôve been writing my diary entries earlier in the day lately. It‚Äôs a bit weird but so am I.

Last night was a mess for me. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I made it to be though. I was just being... overemotional. Lol.

I got back on that discord server I found a few months ago. Someone really nice was talking to me and helped me out of my blues. Turned out to be someone who I‚Äôd already talked to on that server before. We kind of had a mini reunion. She‚Äôs so nice. She‚Äôs like my internet mother who doesn‚Äôt feel like a mom, but literally is? Idk.

We talked for a while. The poor thing. I thought my SH issues were bad, she used to cut to 100, two or three times a day.

I can‚Äôt even imagine being in a place that bad.

Later last evening I started texting Aug. I really think he looks up to me. I don‚Äôt know why. He‚Äôs so confident and open about his struggles. His life is kind of an open book, and I‚Äôm a tad jealous?

We talked about summer, and the camps we are going to. He‚Äôs doing a design camp at another local college in a week or two. I thought about doing it last year, but didn‚Äôt have the $.

We talked about hair, and podcasts, and frog culture. He‚Äôs such a goof. We talked a bit about sexuality and agenderism and shit. I don‚Äôt know if I want to put that label on myself, because I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs completely accurate.

But from a definition standpoint, I‚Äôm somewhere on the spectrum. I just don‚Äôt want to identify with it.

Anyways, I didn‚Äôt go to bed until midnight. I didn‚Äôt get up until 9. I tend to eat so much during summer. I need to stop eating out of boredom. Seriously. I‚Äôve gained all the weight I‚Äôve lost back.

I tried to draw this morning but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to. I have been pretty out of it all day. I doodled a bit, but nothing noteworthy. I‚Äôm really anxious. My calendar sits on my wall watching me with disappointment.

It watches me and wonders when I‚Äôll get my shit together and make good art. I‚Äôm disappointed with myself because I‚Äôve got this entire month to work, but I don‚Äôt know what on.

I didn‚Äôt do anything productive, just stared out my window wishing some revelation would come to me. I‚Äôve got vague ideas about subject matter floating throughout my head, it‚Äôs just when I chase after those ideas, contradictions and fears hold me back and drown me.

I watched the last how to train your dragon movie on tv. I never really liked the series, I just can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 9 years since the first one came out. I wasted an hour and a half on that, and ate lunch.

Social media is killing me. I get so self conscious. I don‚Äôt have many pictures. I don‚Äôt post often. My art is shit. My art is not meant to live on Instagram, yet I find myself thinking it must.

I felt like I really needed some art encouragement, so I got up and went to my room and started reading Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland.

We‚Äôve read a chapter or two for class assignments before, and they totally rocked my mind. We‚Äôre supposed to read the whole book as part of our summer work.

The book is so comforting in an indescribable way. I love it, and I see why it is one of F‚Äôs favorite books.

I flipped to the chapter on art in the academic world where it talks about teaching and students and books and stuff.

The section on teaching made me cry. It really made me realize what a gem F is. I can tell this book has really shaped who he is, and what he strives to be.

I stopped reading after a while because my brain is just too foggy. I don‚Äôt want to miss anything. I want to read this book a hundred times. Or at least 5. I want F to know I‚Äôve enjoyed and learned from this book as much as him.

I also figured out the solution to my problems with etching, the only problem is that materials are expensive, and the ground is only produced in the UK. I can‚Äôt afford to wait a month for it to ship.

I need the ground today. I need to etch plates ASAP. I want to go in to school and work on printing with F.

But I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just not possible. I wish I could figure things out now.

My brain is in a knot I think. I don‚Äôt have any detangler. This book helps me free up the brain fog, but just makes more knots.

I have to go to work here in an hour. I‚Äôm not even dreading it. I hope it rains, were in a tornado watch again, at least that means rain.

It started sprinkling out here a while ago but stopped after a minute.

I don‚Äôt want to go in. I don‚Äôt want to stay out here writing though.

I‚Äôll figure things out tonight. I think my sleep schedule fucked me up last night. No more staying up to midnight for me."
0,"27.05.19. Skipping entries
I can‚Äôt believe I forgot to write a post. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt skip any days. I even knew what I wanted to write about.

But I was so tired, I passed out at 7pm.

Whatever. It happens.

...

Anyways, here‚Äôs what I wanted to write about.

This morning, I woke up on my friend‚Äôs couch, where I‚Äôd crashed drunk and high the night before.

It was 4am, and standing in front of me was a middle-aged man wearing nothing but old underwear.

It was my friend‚Äôs dad.

He had wandered down in the middle of the night for a glass of water.

Instead, he found a young girl passed out on his couch.

I‚Äôm not sure which one of us was more surprised.

For a moment, we stared at each other, frozen.

Then he noticed his son sleeping soundly next to me.

And he said, ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù and introduced himself!

So I introduced myself, too.

And then we remembered we had both met before.

We laughed, and he told me I was welcome to stay and sleep as long as I wanted.

Then he wandered off in his white cotton briefs to get his glass of water and go back upstairs to bed.

And I fell back asleep on his couch.

It was one of the more interesting mornings I‚Äôve had."

PM

I‚Äôve been awake 13 hours

13 hours of my day.

There are 4 hours left of May 27th.

Do I dare become NOCTURNAL?

Do I dare become a night dweller? One of those mad, creatives that work by a dim combination of lamp and moonlight?

I want to be awake when the world sleeps. Then I‚Äôm the one in control. I‚Äôd have the power.

I‚Äôm lonely.

Truly alone.

I‚Äôm one person to my family. Another to my church, and a third to the world.

I love my worldly self. MYself.

I am me. And no one knows ME.

I don‚Äôt even quite know WHO I am. But I wish I had someone to share who I‚Äôve discovered myself to be with.

I want someone to hold, someone to hold me. I want to kiss somebody I love. I‚Äôve always hated the idea kissing‚Äî but for some reason now, it sounds so inviting.

I want to kiss someone, yes, but I want someone who knows me, and I, them. I want someone to hold me tight and look at me with eyes of understanding.

I want a boyfriend. Not a boyfriend, just someone. Someone that I love. I hate the word boyfriend. So cliche.

And I can‚Äôt make the same mistakes. I fucked up with Rob. I betrayed myself, my morals, what I believed, because I was a naive, horny teenager. But that was two years ago.

I‚Äôm a different person. And I‚Äôll be a different person in two years.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying.

I guess I‚Äôm just lonely. I want human connection. I want to be in the presence of someone, alone.

I want someone to cry with.

A friend?

A lover?

God‚Äî what am I saying?

This is so unlike me. I don‚Äôt give two shits about relationships.

But suddenly... I do?

Fuck fuck fuck. My brain is jello.

Today was long and longer. I woke up. L made French toast. Showered real fast. Drew the tree outside my window. Made a calendar. Spun around in my chair for a while.

Then I got up on a mission. I decided to go on a walk. A walk to finally figure out where F‚Äôs mom lives. He‚Äôs told me before, past the split in ‚Äî-st street.

He told me there was a sign I‚Äôd recognize on the garage.

So I ventured out. It was humid as fuck. I walked down past R‚Äôs house. Down near where I wanted to go. But I went left. I went left because I was scared, and because I wanted to come down that street from a different side.

I kept finding myself thinking, what if he was there? With his family? Spending Memorial Day with his mom?

I‚Äôm so obsessive.

I walked so far. By my old house. There were two people standing out in the yard looking up at the house. I passed old neighbors whose names I didn‚Äôt know, and rounded the corner to go down ‚Äîst street. My heart was racing and I didn‚Äôt know why.

Well I did know why. I passed one house, two houses, three, four, then five. The fifth house has an odd little sign on the garage above an oddly placed mailbox. I knew that sign by heart.

I tried not to stop and stare at the place. I‚Äôve seen this house a million times. I used to play and ride by bike down there by it. Imagine the thought, I might‚Äôve passed F visiting his mom 5 years before I ever knew of him.

I went back home and pondered this.

...

I really did live close to his mom. Less than a 5 minute walk.

Damn.

I want to cry, but I can‚Äôt. I can feel my PMS kicking in. Maybe it‚Äôs not PMS. I don‚Äôt keep track of my cycle.

TW: SH


I broke my clean streak last night. Just for a bit. Just a couple tiny cuts. Just enough to get that satisfaction from slicing my skin open. Just through the epidermis.

My scars are fading so fast. They may even become barely visible someday.

I want them to go, but they have given me so much identity this last half year. Jesus.

I just got thrown back to the first time I cut. Don‚Äôt remember why I even did it. I just remember thinking, I can stop.

I couldn‚Äôt stop. I still think I‚Äôve got the power to stop now, but I don‚Äôt.

I just want to watch my self inflicted incisions full up with blood, and then pick the scabs away.

My knife is under my bed. I could cut right now if I wanted. I don‚Äôt really want to, but I can. I can cut. I have the power.

I have the power to control me right now. I can choose.

But I don‚Äôt want to choose.

I need to take a shit."

i meant to post last night but getting late from work messed my mind up. work was irritating as usual.  i dont know what to write about since the same bullshit go down daily. i have a grocery manager who i used to like yells at me and is on my ass about things that i have nothing to do with and a superviser that is cool but been acting like a bitch and is on me about shit as well. i know how to do my job. i just wish they fuck off.   the night manager asked me if i wanted to work nights with him. i dont know if he was being serious but im considering it. he said its too many hours but fuck it, i need all the hours i can get. im tired of being a cashier. i get shitted on by almost everyone.

&#x200B;

i am officially on vacation. i feel like a bum. i havent had a whole week off from work since i was unemployed. it is bringing back memerories of feeling shitty and going on long walks in hopes of finding money.  ill read my depression management book  to feel better.

ugh work last night got me feeling aggravated this morning. i wish everyone would just do their fucking jobs and stop looking at me to do everything for them.  i wish they didnt bring back self checkout. there is not enough cashiers to run it and people are yelling at me and blaming me for shit that happens there. i am considering getting my i.t certification sooner than later. ill still get the associate degree. i just need to get the hell out of the shithole. the daily disrespect is not worth it. 5 years of being shitted on was enough."
0,"27.05.19. Lazy Sunday
It‚Äôs 12:03am, so I guess technically I skipped a day.

But whatever, it‚Äôs the same day until you sleep.

Today was pretty good.

I ‚Äústudied‚Äù all morning (read: stared into space with my books out).

It‚Äôs so fucking frustrating.

I hope they diagnose me with ADHD so I can get medicated. My life would be so much better if I could just fucking *think*.

When I got back, it was still warm and sunny, so I decided to go skateboarding with my brother.

He‚Äôs only 14, so he‚Äôs in that stage where he‚Äôs nervous about everything, but too embarrassed to admit it.

So when the weather‚Äôs nice, I like to take him out and make him do things that scare the shit out of him.

Builds character.

He‚Äôs too self-conscious to say no, which is the only reason he goes.

Plus, he‚Äôs 14 - he wants to be cool.

When we first got out, he was an absolute mess; over-apologizing and tripping over himself, arms flailing out as he jumped off his board in terror every time he moved or saw a car out of the corner of his eye.

But as he started getting comfortable, he completely transformed.

By the end, he was riding down the whole street without stopping. He even did turns and went over some (tiny) cracks!

But more importantly, his attitude completely changed.

Instead of apologizing and avoiding eye contact, he was trying things, laughing when he fell, even teasing me and calling himself a better skater - he told me I have a lot to learn from him.

He even said I should look up to him, now that he‚Äôs taller than me.

By like, half an inch!

It barely counts.

But I let him say what he wanted.

He was just having fun - deep down, he‚Äôs incredibly kind and sensitive.

But he‚Äôs also a 14-year-old boy, so he would be *beyond* mortified if I knew he‚Äôs not really an asshole.

Every time he said something good about himself, even if it was clearly meant as a joke, I agreed. Even if it just sounded like I was continuing the joke.

Because subconsciously, you could tell the words got to him, even if he didn‚Äôt realize I meant it.

Maybe only because he didn‚Äôt realize I meant it.

He wouldn‚Äôt have accepted any compliments if he knew I meant them. So I had to be sneaky about it.

By the time we headed home, he was beaming.

We could‚Äôve skated back in the dark - his grin would have lit up the whole street for us.

When we got home, I said: ‚ÄúThat was fun!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

From a 14-year-old boy??

That monosyllabic grunt says *everything*.

Then I went upstairs to my room to change.

I‚Äôm going out to a free stand-up comedy thing at some bar downtown tonight with my friends, so I have to wear something-not-sweatpants.

It‚Äôll be the first time in a while for me.

My housemates and I once tried to name each other‚Äôs styles. Mine was ‚ÄúBasement Casual‚Äù.

But today, I wore black leggings and a black t shirt.

Baby steps.

I felt kind of bad, because while I was changing in my room I heard the kids.

But I stayed in my room.

They have no idea I‚Äôm even here.

The plan happened so last-minute, only my mom and siblings know. And my dad, but he‚Äôs away.

So I went this whole weekend without seeing anyone else in the family.

It‚Äôs not that hard, even though we live together. The house is big enough to hold 15 people, and we all have different schedules.

I feel bad for not taking care of the kids.

Or even saying hi.

But fuck.

I just couldn‚Äôt.

I needed a weekend where I could just be 19 and not needed to take care of anyone except myself.

Things have been better for them lately, anyways, since the last time I went home. Not much better, but enough that my therapist probably wouldn‚Äôt legally have to report us anymore.

Anyways, they call me whenever they need something, so I know they‚Äôre ok.

When the kids were done eating dinner, I snuck out to go to a bar with my friends.

We saw a no-cover comedy night.

It was fucking HYSTERICAL.

My favourite act was this random old white guy, whose entire act was just him standing on stage being a random old white guy.

Like, he *was* the joke.

He basically just rambled about his kid skateboarding with no helmet, how he prefers plain shirts, and how he didn‚Äôt want to tell us his pet‚Äôs name because it made a good password. He even pulled out his reading glasses at one point.

I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt.

It‚Äôs one of those things where you can‚Äôt even explain the joke, because there‚Äôs nothing to explain.

You just have to experience it.

Or maybe I was just drunk.

When that was over, my buddies and I got burritos and then went to the park to smoke.

We got high on the swing set and then looked at the stars.

Later, I‚Äôm crashing on one of their couches. So we can stay out bar-hopping and getting high in parks as long as we want.

Now we‚Äôre wandering around, getting drunk and into trouble until we get bored, then getting high again.

It sounds so boring.

All the best nights do.

We‚Äôre so busy enjoying each other‚Äôs company that we don‚Äôt even need to be interesting.

It‚Äôs just a bunch of little moments that I‚Äôll cherish forever, even though I won‚Äôt even remember them.

Plus, we have a tradition of recording ourselves when we get high, so I don‚Äôt need to care about the details. I have hours of our conversations I can re-live whenever I feel like it.

I‚Äôve never listened to any of them.

I don‚Äôt need to.

The feeling stays with me, even as the details fade.

For me, for now, that‚Äôs enough.

Now we‚Äôre at a random pizza place.

We‚Äôre just sitting around doing nothing.

Some of us are on our phones (which is how I‚Äôm writing this). Some of us are eating pizza. Some of us are draped over empty tables or each other‚Äôs laps, totally zoned out in our own little worlds.

It‚Äôs the best.

I couldn‚Äôt tell you why.

But I wouldn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else right now."

I'm still alive

I'm not okay, but I don't want to die

I'm sick of realizing I did nothing on things that I've planned

I hate telling people I'm doing fine just to shut them up and stop

&#x200B;

I'm still not sure if I'm crazy or sane

I'm loosing sleep at night and so tired to face the day

I don't feel like moving

I'm tired of posting in the internet just for validation

Is expressing myself just another way to fish for attention?

&#x200B;

I hate not having a reason to try to look better

Anyway, all the people I talk to are considered strangers

If I sound sane and normal only when I am in the internet

Then I am so so glad that I hated myself

&#x200B;

I am not good in decisions

I struggle with emotions

I wouldn't be my own friend, I'm much of a burden

I feel the emptiness inside but I smile around people

A day without a fucked up thought is a miracle

&#x200B;

I know I'm fortunate enough than most people do

But I wish I'm also capable to to feel it too

I know I'm pretty good and have some skill sets

But I haven't been great to anything to be considered talented

&#x200B;

I wish this poem gets deeper

I wish the words rhyme better

I know 99 percent of people really won't mind

I think the idea of posting this makes me realize

it's useless cause reading this is a waste of time

&#x200B;

I know what's good or wrong

I wish I was more responsible with decisions

I wish I could reach out to people that are mentally stable

But if I did, I wouldn't waste their time on me 'cause I am disabled

&#x200B;

I feel alone

I know I'm not

I had so many people to talk to, but I have stopped

They didn't deserve the drama that even me don't understand

I couldn't bear to become a burden again

I'd rather stay silent than to have an awkward moment

&#x200B;

I should be happy in the moment

I am not when I reflect

I try things just to waste my time and get distracted

Cause if I get in touch with myself I am so self-destructive

&#x200B;

I don't want to hurt the people I love

So I bury my own self and vowed not to open up

Until horrible decisions dug up the coffin

And I made mistakes up to the point of no return

&#x200B;

I can't predict that things that I'll do, I am never sure

Just because you know you're color blind, doesn't mean you can see color

I can't face myself in the mirror, I feel sick of myself

If I'm disgusted of what's inside, how can I ask for help?"

Today took some pleasant, unexpected turns.

Got up. Went to church. Same old shabang.

I was in the car going home when Anna called me and asked if I wanted to go to Chipotle for lunch. I said sure.

A few mins later she picked me up and we ate at Chipotle.

We sat outside. It was so nice out. We decided to have a picnic later.

When we finished eating we went to her house and she worked on some stuff for work real fast and we decided to go downtown to the river market.

We spent forever trying to find parking and got lost. Some big Memorial Day event happening where we were gonna park. We ended up finding a spot by the river market after getting lost again.

I told my dad we were going somewhere else downtown.

We parked near this long bridge that goes over the train tracks and ends at the river edge. The last time I was here was two years ago. On our CC field trip with F. The first time I realized how fun our art class was.

A train went by and honked really loud and scared us half to death.

I was kind of sad. CC was cancelled this year. They sold the warehouse. Vicki moved away. CC at the warehouse was over forever.

I wonder if Vicki kept my rock sculpture?

Anyways, after I got sad remembering the past, we went back to her car and put on some sunscreen and walked to the market.

It was 3:00 and most of the vendors were gone besides the permanent ones.

We left and went to the grocery store and bought some fruit for a picnic. We went to the park and took some pics and ate a bunch of water melon and pineapple. My lips are raw and sore from the acidity of the pineapple, but it was so sweet.

I kind of hate myself. I said I wasn‚Äôt going to spend any money. I spent like 25 bucks today.

I‚Äôm an idioooot.

A tired idiot.

I‚Äôm gonna shower because my sister says I stink. I showered this morning. I‚Äôll just use body wash. Maybe I just need to change clothes.

I want to read. An escape before I get to work tomorrow. Get to work on being productive.

Which I know is more of a lifestyle thing, but still.

Today was so nice. But my brain can‚Äôt take in much more. Maybe I just need a shower and some wake up music.

I‚Äôm very backwards today.

Woke up and made some eggs.

Made a budget. And it turns out I really gotta penny pinch if that Santa Fe trip ends up being like 1,000$. Fucking plane ticket prices. I‚Äôm gonna have to take off less weekends this summer.

Shit.

I thought about taking on more hours of work but I really don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll find an alternative way of making money‚Äî or saving.

Work was work. Alex said gluten free lady said hi while I was on break. That woman is so sweet.

My manager gave me a dollar. That was cool. I lost a bet with Alex that we could not use our left arm for as long as possible. Whoever lost had to buy the other dinner.

I lost, but technically she should of. After 40 minutes my arm felt like it was gonna fall off from inactivity.

I bought her dinner. Bought myself an ice cream cone.

Got home and had some alone time.

I really should shower but I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll get up early.

I figure I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm not gonna spend 300$ at fuckin‚Äô art camp, right? They DO have a store, and we will probably eat out once or twice on the weekend. I can‚Äôt imagine me spending more than 150$ on supplies, and that‚Äôs pushing it.

Who knows. Maybe supplies were included with the price? God, I sure hope so. How nice would that be?! But I doubt it, the AI loves it‚Äôs money.

I‚Äôm really excited though. I‚Äôm really nervous my skills aren‚Äôt good enough. I need to draw more. I need to draw people more. I‚Äôm going to do a life drawing every day. I need to get better at figure drawing. Maybe I‚Äôll get my sister to help me sometimes.

I don‚Äôt wanna be the kid who is mediocre. I want to be the best. It‚Äôs selfish, but at least I‚Äôm honest with myself right?

But yeah. On top of that, I‚Äôve got fuckin‚Äô church camp from the 26th-30th next month. Don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. I feel like an alien at church sometimes. I didn‚Äôt think I strayed THAT far from their path, but damn.

Maybe I should read my bible. I don‚Äôt know.

Anyways, after fuckin‚Äô church camp, I‚Äôve got a week until I pack up and move to the local art college for three weeks. I‚Äôll have classes most of the day and it‚Äôs gonna be amazing. I‚Äôm still in disbelief that I‚Äôm able to go, and didn‚Äôt have to pay but 300$.

I hope I learn a lot of useful stuff. I really hope. I want to learn some skills to take back to the classroom in August.

Speaking of the classroom, I may have found a solution to my etching ground issue. I asked a printmaker on insta what ground they used, and they said something like ‚ÄúB.I.G. Ground.‚Äù

I‚Äôm gonna order that and give it a whirl, supposedly it‚Äôs non-toxic. I want to coat a plate, and go in to school in a few weeks and print. (If F is there and willing.)

He kept telling me he‚Äôd be in the classroom a lot during the summer, but he‚Äôs posted stuff on Facebook saying like, peace, room. 204 till August.

But he‚Äôs not actually leaving the room for two months right? He said he‚Äôd be back. Right? I don‚Äôt know anymore...

I miss him. It‚Äôs only been two days. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I want to prove to him I‚Äôm a good artist over summer. I want to be the best he‚Äôs ever had come though his class. This is my time to kick ass!

I‚Äôm gonna put on some music. Purple Pilgrims probably. Something quiet and dreamy.

So today I met up with my two best friends for the first time in about 6 months and by god did it feel like it, we went to a store before, grabbed snacks, went to the cinema, grabbed drinks and a bucket of popcorn from a coupon one of us had ; grabbed tickets for detective Pikachu. It was a good movie and there must've been at least 6 plot twists, finished up there and went to grab some MacDonald's, then to (after a few calls) stay at my house till 6, at which time they both left to me relaxing for the same evening and to bed and asleep hopefully soon."

Then I swallowed half a bottle of Advil.

Clearly, things didn‚Äôt go according to plan.

But when I woke up the next day, the sticky note was still on my desk; a bright yellow flag of despair.

At first, it felt like it was taunting me.

Dying had been the very last thing for me to try.

Now things were so hopeless I couldn‚Äôt even do that.

But then I read it again.

I thought: *Well, guess I just can‚Äôt live like this anymore.*

It was awful.

And it‚Äôs always awful.

So I‚Äôve cold turkey quit all social media. It was really affecting my way of thinking. I was always trying to meet a new standard of living and it was depressing me. Girlfriend broke up with me so seeing her post all those pictures hurt too.
I go through the day randomly thinking about stuff to post and then I remember I don‚Äôt have it anymore.
Pictures to take, tweets to tweet, memes to share. All of it.
I‚Äôve spend all day watching movies and it‚Äôs 9pm and I‚Äôm super bored. No one really to talk to. Bout to go to bed just because I‚Äôm bored."

It has been a wild day.

I've done some  things that I could not believe that I could do. I was hanging out with a friend, and our conversation got a little too deep that it hits me like I have never felt before.

I had some dark days in my life and I was not in a really good place. But, I managed to pull through. I had learned how to detach myself from emotions and to have a constant happy mood so my days will not be ruined. The pain and hurt on my chest magically disappeared. Doubts and anxiety do not visit me as often as before. I could now sleep at night without creating a false sense of loneliness, just for the sake of feeling lonely. But as a price to pay, I have never felt not so alive. It's like I am not living, but just not dying. It was like I have separated myself from feeling things. Like I have buried someone deep inside me and chose a new persona that vowed not to talk to the previous version of myself. All the good things that happen, this new persona is owning them. But all the bad stuffs, I am throwing it all to the person who I was before, let him suffer the worrying, the doubts, the anxieties, so I don't have to deal with it. And for the most part, it's worked. I have lived a ""happy"" and ""normal"" life.

I was not really aware of what I was going through until our conversation last night. Somehow, I felt like there was something inside me that I keep on denying, suppressing, running from. But that night, I felt him. He was clawing his way back to the surface. All the feelings, emotions, and selfish thought that I had threw into him for the past year, he puked it out and hit me like a train wreck. And, now, I am back at it again. The hole in my chest that I thought that I already patched up is now gaping again. The feeling of having a sharp scalpel being stab into my chest is back. I don't even have any reason to be sad. But since last night, I know deep inside, I am not happy.

On the contrary, I have never felt more alive since then. Is it weird??

Hello. It has been a few months since my last post.

I finally got my surgery last week. It was quite a thing to recover... I still have 5 weeks till I'm fully recovered though. Visited my gynecologist for a follow up so he cut my stitches out and showed me pics of my tumor... that tumor was a lot bigger than anyone expected including me. It looked chunky. I'm glad it was removed.

The first couple of days was a doozy to recover because it hurt but I was told to start walking around by day 3. I definitely felt like shit but painfully and slowly I walked around. And slowly and day by day I am getting better and better.

Today happens to be day 9 since my surgery. I am able to do a bit of air crunches (basically standing stretches while lifting one knee up and bringing my head down close to my knee and then returning bringing the knee back down and head back up) to help strengthen my pelvic floor again because it still feels odd down there, but it doesn't hurt to do it. Would have definitely hurt a few days ago though. Also walking doesn't hurt anymore either. I still can't run though, it would be too much but I will be able to eventually once I'm fully healed. Gotta work hard on recovering my muscle strength. I've also been eating foods with protein and also vitamin c foods.

So yeah I am doing good so far! Recovery was great and I am so happy to be tumor and cyst-free. The name of my procedure was a myomectomy and a cystectomy, but more emphasis on the myomectomy since they removed one of my ovaries and tubes that was replaced by the tumor. My gynecologist said I was a good case.

I struggled a lot in the past year so once this recovery is over I should be back to my normal life! üò≠"

today was okay and annoying.   my coworkers kept texting me about getting the schedule for them and i couldn't do it because i was not home and i sure as hell was not going up to my job on my day off so ill have to get it tomorrow. im anxious to know what days I'm working next week because i have to start working at the pool asap. this also means i won't be working with my cousin but i don't care because he is a pain in the ass. he wants me to go to some fucking babyshower my oldest neice is doing and its the same week as the picnic. plus she already had the baby so no use in going. I'll see her at the picnic. the babyshower is all white dress code and at a fancy hotel so definitely a hell no to that. i will not be requesting off for it so fuck that.  it just aggravated me because he makes it seem like the baby shower is so important but the picnic is and he just trying to get information out of me because he is nosy. i hate that shit.

i talked to my older brother whom i have not seen in years. we spent an hour conversating which was cool. i need to talk to my other siblings more.

so far i read one chapter of my depression book and it talks about techniques used to fight it. ill be looking forward to it.

my xbox and roku tv been having issues streaming and i don't know what the fuck is going on. the wifi is good on my phone but everything else is an issue. a good reset on the router is needed. ill do it later tonight.

with school starting back up and working two jobs, im cutting back on youtube and showtime and hulu. i wont have enough time for it so no need for distraction.


just want to get this off my chest. i am Wondering who really has my back. everyone so far been telling me they are looking out for me and yet they somehow used me. including my family. man I don't even know anymore because so far everyone been fucking snakes.  so far the only person to have my back is me. it is a neverending cycle. people used and manipulate me and i end up in hot water. this is a fucked up world man. one of the reasons why i am depressed. everyone lies and use one another.

my yoga mat came in. hooray I guess.

sorry if this is tmi but i feel horny tonight and will be going on Instagram for hotties.

i could use a bf in my corner. i need somebody."

I didn‚Äôt want to write anything right now, I‚Äôm completely exhausted.

But I‚Äôll force myself to, because it‚Äôs this kind of ritual I need to do to feel like I‚Äôve got a grip on my life.

Documentation of mind and life.

Anyways, to the point‚Äî

I woke up early, took a shower, made some tea and listened to a podcast or two in the living room watching the cars go by. I‚Äôve been really enjoying 99% invisible lately.

I paced around the house some, ate a leftover hash brown square still cold.

I worked on cleaning my room some more, and got utterly bored. I wanted to buy a desk for my room. A real, workspace with a real table. Not my crappy one from third grade.

So we got in the car and started driving to IKEA. Halfway there, my dad remembered he was going to have me drive, so he stopped in a parking lot and we switched seats.

I was super nervous until I actually started driving the car. It‚Äôs a lot easier than I think every time. I drove all the way to IKEA, even parked.

I bought my desk, and shelves. Finally.

I drove us home. Parked in the garage and everything.

I made some Mexican rice for lunch with a cheese stick.

Then I put together my table in the living room, and moved it into my room and cleaned a bit more.

Later I‚Äôd given up and dad came by and helped me clean. The only reason my motivation came back was me trying to pick up bloody toilet paper sheets before he saw them. I think he picked up a pencil sharpener blade, but didn‚Äôt suspect a thing.

That‚Äôs the thing about cutting my legs. To people who don‚Äôt know anything about SH other than people sometimes cut their wrists, assume people only cut their wrists.

Anyways. I‚Äôm done cutting. I‚Äôm sick of that shit. I had urges to the other day but I shut them down. I was only cutting because it was a ritual for me. Just an act I was addicted to. But I‚Äôve replaced cutting with healing. I rub lemon balm over my scars instead of opening up my skin.

So we cleaned some more until my floor was empty. By this time I had to get ready for work.

I trained a new girl at work. Chloe. She seems nice enough. It started to thunderstorm really bad. My phone was dead so I couldn‚Äôt check radar. One customer said we were in a tornado watch.

When I got home my dad had cleaned my floor with his fancy cleaner. It was still thunder storming bad and I just cleaned my desk some more and organized a bit.

Then we went into a tornado warning. Radar looked bad, rotation to the south of us. We were on the outside of the warning box, but still super close. Something seemed to be developing right over top of us. There were sirens. We went downstairs just in case.

That‚Äôs the thing about us. Tornadoes don‚Äôt phase us whatsoever. It‚Äôs just like, ‚Äúugh, so I have to go downstairs? It‚Äôs not even that close!‚Äù

We stayed downstairs maybe 5 mins then we went back upstairs. I went back to my room and cleaned some more.

Dad helped me hang up my shelves for a while and we realized we need a different anchor so he will get that in the morning. I‚Äôm bummed it can‚Äôt be finished tonight, but I‚Äôm kind of exhausted.

I wish I weren‚Äôt so tired.

I have to work all day tomorrow. Great.

I need the money though. I gotta stop spending what little I get from my dinky job.

I‚Äôm just gonna lay here listening to another podcast, Nocturne. I‚Äôll watch the lighting until I pass out.‚Äô

I‚Äôm ready for summer."

These feelings, I don't know, where they came from and why it hurts so much. Maybe, I should have known. This has been going on since 2014, maybe sooner. I can't remember. I don't want to remember.

I sometimes laughed at people speaking about gender dysphoria on the internet. I simply couldn't imagine it, especially with the very young ones. Had I known, how horrible it was - gods, I wish I could take it back. Maybe I bottled up these feelings for a bit too long and I couldn't cope with being confronted with it.

I just... I don't want to be a girl anymore. I mean, I like the aesthetic. I like, how girls look. I like, how I look. But it's not me. How often have I cried these past years because I am a girl?

I like gay stuff. Fanfictions, fanart, movies, real-life couples, whatever. It might be cringy, but I like it. Over the years, I started to yearn for those types of relationships. I simply enjoy dudes fucking, so what? Men like lesbians, too, it's not too weird, right? It brought me a lot of joy.

Not anymore, though. Now, every time I read these stories or watch that damned porn, I start crying. I start crying because I can't have that. I can't have a dick and stick it in someone. I can't be a twink or a bear or whatever. I'm doomed to be me and I hate it. I can't even fathom to imagine letting a man touch me now. I don't want to sleep with anyone like this. With this body - it's revolting.

And I don't want to get T and let myself be transformed. *It's not real. It's unnatural.* My body doesn't deserve to be punished. It's a perfectly fine, girl body. It hasn't done me any wrong.

It's not meant to be.

I try to accept that, but I can't stop crying. I'm telling myself this is just some kind of fetish. That this doesn't mean anything. I'm not trans. But it *hurts*.

Maybe in my next life... maybe I'll be lucky then. Perhaps I'll be some cute, little twink. But, for now, it's not meant to be. I'm not meant to be granted every wish. Frankly, I don't deserve it anyway. How many people have I hurt in my life? This is the payback. An eternal blemish, which will stick to me in this life.

Maybe I'll manage to like this girl existence, too. Somehow. And if not... well, then I'll stay alone. I'd rather be alone than hurt some poor soul because I'm repulsed by my own gender. He doesn't deserve that, whoever he'll be.

I hope this will get better, maybe I'll forget about this enterprise."

I went home to visit this weekend.

My mom was supposed to pick me up from the station, but at the last minute said she was busy, and how would I feel about getting myself home?

I texted back: *I don‚Äôt mind.*

This happens every time. I had already bought my subway tickets.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm desperate to spend time alone in a car getting grilled by my mom, anyways.

I let myself in when I got home.

My mom was sitting at the computer playing this online card game she‚Äôs obsessed with. It‚Äôs some virtual gambling thing.

She came over to greet me.

‚ÄúI could‚Äôve picked you up, you know.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mind the subway.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, I could have. If you wanted me to, I would.‚Äù

Then she waited.

I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine to take the subway.‚Äù

Satisfied, she nodded.

Then she made a face.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pimple.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. It looks like herpes. Welcome home, baby!‚Äù

...

Update:

Apparently, my dad‚Äôs in Europe for the weekend.

He said hopefully he‚Äôll be around next time I go home.

He always says that."

I wasn't feeling depressed today which is good. work was okay except for the last customer that was too confusing about her bill. she was trying to figure out how much she has to pay even though it says so on the screen. it frustrated me and the other customers in line greatly. it amazes me how stupid people can be.


i talked to two of my coworkers about a supervisor who been degrading me and making me feel like shit. at first i thought it was out of love but then it was out of pure shittiness. my coworka carla witnessed it the other day and she couldn't believe it. she said if it happens again she will say something.  the supervisor name is carrie and she been training to be a manager. my department manager was there when it happened and she didn't say a thing. it just shows how much she cares about her employees. my other coworker donna couldn't believe it either and told me to call the union. i love how donna and carla looks out for me. i feel loved.  i definitely will consider calling the union because i work too hard just to be degraded like that.

soon i will be starting my summer job at the community pool. i don't want to but i have to.  i have figure out how to balance two jobs and go to school online. this summer will kick my ass for sure so i will need lots of hail Mary on this one.

I haven't read my depression book yet. i got distracted by so much shit. i Really need to.

i would like to say thank you to everyone that commented their concerns on my posts. i really appreciate it."

I did a *lot* of googling about PTSD.

It said it doesn‚Äôt go away on its own. You have to face it, or your symptoms just keep getting worse.

Sounds like a fucking death sentence.

It‚Äôs so unfair.

I didn‚Äôt ask for any of this.

I just want to be able to be happy without this fucking cloud over my head.

Why‚Äôd all this shit have to happen to me?

I had more than enough shit to begin with.

It said only 25% of people develop PTSD. 1 in 4 people‚Äôs brains just can‚Äôt handle it.

That number was a lot lower than I thought it would be. 75% of people are *fine* after something bad happens? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I‚Äôve never felt so pathetic in my entire life.

Not even when I was raped.

It said if something bad has happened before, it can ‚Äúre-traumatize‚Äù you.

So basically what that means is I‚Äôm not just traumatized from the whole ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù situation.

I‚Äôm also re-traumatized from every time I‚Äôve ever felt that helpless and alone.

Since St. Patty‚Äôs, I‚Äôve been endlessly going over almost *my entire life*.

Fuck.

Not to mention all the new memories that resurfaced. Those were fun to flashback to.

*Fuck*.

I thought I was getting better.

A lot of the really intense feelings have dulled. But... so have all the rest of them. It makes me feel empty inside. And disconnected.

Is that why I can‚Äôt be happy?

My counsellor asked me if I still think about it a lot and I said no. So she said she‚Äôll never bring it up again, and from now on we can just focus on the future and symptom management.

And I was so relieved.

I thought that meant I was getting better.

And it‚Äôs true- I don‚Äôt obsess over the details of what happened all the time anymore.

I haven‚Äôt had a flashback in ages.

I can leave the house without constantly spinning in every direction, scanning for attackers and feeling like something bad will happen any moment now. I only do that in big crowds now, or when I feel unsafe.

And most of the time, when I start thinking about it, I can make myself stop.

But then I took that survey at the psycho-assessment place and learned there‚Äôs a difference between *choosing* not to think about something versus just not thinking about it.

And I am definitely choosing not to think about it.

Did I make a mistake when I told my counsellor I had processed it enough?

I *really* don‚Äôt want to get back into it.

I just got out of it!

My counsellor asked me what I would change about my life and I couldn‚Äôt think of anything.

On paper, things seem pretty great right now.

But I can‚Äôt enjoy any of it for very long. I keep having all these racing thoughts or crazy anxiety or I just get so numb and empty I don‚Äôt even care about anything anymore.

But aren‚Äôt those just symptoms now? That I can reduce with symptom management?

Plus, maybe I‚Äôm just self-sabotaging because I secretly don‚Äôt *want* to be happy. That sounds pretty fucked up, but I read about that on the internet, too.

What if I fucked up because I‚Äôm too avoidant, and now I‚Äôll never be able to be happy, because I won‚Äôt be able to move on? But I DON‚ÄôT want to talk about it. I don‚Äôt want to go back down that rabbit hole. I don‚Äôt think I could handle it.

It‚Äôs so fucking unfair.

I really do want to get better.

But I don‚Äôt even know what better means, or what I need to do to get there.

But my counsellor says she can only help me get there if I tell her what better means to me.

But I don‚Äôt know!

And even if I did know, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to say it.

My old counsellor gave me that stupid feeling wheel and told me I needed to name my feelings. But we never got around to the specifics of how or what that even means, and then I switched counsellors.

Lately, she‚Äôs been on my mind a lot.

Does that mean she ‚Äúre-traumatized‚Äù me too? Or am I just obsessive? Why can‚Äôt I shut my mind off?

Maybe my counsellor was right.

Maybe I‚Äôm just not ready.

How do you know when you‚Äôre ready?

What if I‚Äôm never ready?

Am I just doomed to be miserable forever?

I feel really hopeless.

I really, really, really, *really* hope the assessment lady doesn‚Äôt diagnose me with PTSD.

Because if she does then I‚Äôll have to think about all this for real instead of just as a hypothetical. And I‚Äôll probably have to tell my counsellor, too.

And I *just* I got moved down to once every two weeks.

That‚Äôs *progress*.

That‚Äôs what I was hoping for this whole time!

I thought it meant I was getting better. That I don‚Äôt have PTSD. That I‚Äôm capable of moving on.

I don‚Äôt want to undo all that!

And I feel like if I bring this up she‚Äôs just gonna think I‚Äôm making up problems for attention so I can go back more often. Because this opens up a whole bunch of problems.

But I don‚Äôt *want* to go back more often!

I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in therapy forever.

I don‚Äôt even like going now!

But what if I do, and I‚Äôm just lying to myself by thinking that I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm avoidant or in denial?

All this stupid psychobabble is getting in my head.

I just don‚Äôt want to be such an attention whore.

Here are some symptoms of PTSD:
- Inability to focus
- Racing thoughts

- Depression
- Emotional dysregulation
- Poor impulse control/reckless decision making
- Substance abuse issues
- Low self-esteem

I have all those symptoms, and then some. Honestly, reading the descriptions of either diagnosis makes me feel a little too exposed for my liking.

If I get diagnosed with ADHD, I can take medication and get extra support at school and my problems will practically vanish overnight, from what I‚Äôve heard.

If I have PTSD, things get a whole lot more complicated. From what I‚Äôve read online, it‚Äôs essentially a life full of pain and suffering.

I gave up trying to study for my math test after sitting in the library doing nothing for four and a half hours, struggling to focus through these racing thoughts.

But what‚Äôs causing them?

I wish I knew.

I feel like it‚Äôs ADHD. I‚Äôve been like this forever.

But... I‚Äôve gotten a lot worse this past year.

A lot of shit got stirred up.

My last day of assessment is tomorrow. I just got the reminder email. Then they‚Äôll finally, officially diagnose me, if I have anything (‚Äúif‚Äù, lol!).

But all bets are off on what with.

The psychologist said I‚Äôm ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù.

I know which diagnosis I‚Äôm hoping for.

There‚Äôs a full-blown thunderstorm outside right now, but when the lightning stops, I‚Äôm going out to get high.

Yesterday I stayed late again with F. The only notable thing I‚Äôll mention is that we looked up some more stuff for the Santa Fe trip.

We looked at hotels and compared prices and he even called one to see if they had a group rate. We even dropped the idea of driving in a van for 12 hours to flying there in a plane.

We would get there in a fourth of the time, and we wouldn‚Äôt have to take off Thursday AND Friday.

It‚Äôs almost a reality.

Anyways. That happened.

But today was the last day of school. The last day before summer. The last day I‚Äôd see F for two and a half months unless I see him over the summer. He said he‚Äôd come to my art camp exhibition. He also said I could come in to use the classroom later.

Today was fast. I‚Äôd only be leaving now on a normal day. I went to 6th hour first thing in the morning and half assed my final. It was bad. And F knew it. I just looked at the comments on it and half were grammar errors, the other just the result of me quickly researching and writing a short essay.

It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not worried. He knows I half assed it. That‚Äôs all that matters. He knows it‚Äôs not my best self.

We tried some photo polymer plates that didn‚Äôt end up working. Later class ended and I asked to stay for seminar because I was originally going to ride the bus.

And I sat there for a while and Athena came in with some knitting project and some other kid and was talking. I was silent. F was silent. Not much was happening and the silence was too awkward.

During class I‚Äôd written him a note. Thanking him for an amazing school year. He went into the other room and I got up, packed my stuff up, set the note on his podium, and went into the other room to say bye.

The goodbye felt rushed. And I‚Äôm sorry it was. He said again he‚Äôd be there during the summer sometimes and if I wanted to work on stuff it‚Äôd be okay. We said bye and said to have a good summer. I said you too. And I was okay. I was okay.

I‚Äôd been stressing about that moment for months and months and months. And it was not a sad goodbye, nor a happy goodbye. And I think I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt. Obviously no one likes a sad goodbye, but a happy goodbye would mean I‚Äôd miss him too much.

I got home. Listened to some music, put on a podcast, and started cleaning my room. I opened my window and after an hour got bored of cleaning and went to go sit outside and soak up some sun since it was so cool out.

I put on some sunscreen and I‚Äôm just able to sit here thinking and enjoying things.

I will not waste this summer.

This will be the most productive time of my life yet. This will be a summer of learning, growth, and a big, huge, introverted vacation from people.

I am beyond excited and completely content.

I‚Äôm going to get up by 8 every day. I‚Äôm going to read every day. I‚Äôm going to draw every day for multiple hours. I‚Äôm going to be outside for as much as my body will tolerate. I‚Äôll get over my fear of bugs.

Anyways. It‚Äôs less sunny now.

I hope my freckles come back.

I want to be a little more tan.

I want to come out of this a little more wise.

Anyways. I should go in to charge my phone.

Turns out I practically pass it every day on the way to school or church. He lives in a nicer house than I thought he did. I don‚Äôt think he family is poor by any means, his mom lives in a nice house I know now.

I looked it up on google earth, it‚Äôs beautiful, with cool terra-cotta roofing. There‚Äôs even a courtyard in the middle with a small pool.

Anyways. Stalking aside, it was a good day. I‚Äôm still out-of-my-mind-excited for our potential Santa Fe trip. ‚Äîjust a random thought. I can‚Äôt stop day dreaming of it.

Speaking of dreams. I did dream last night. I feel like I‚Äôve got a superpower where I can control whether I dream or not.

It was weird and there was one scene where I was in some sort of craft store and F was there and he was talking to me about his son or something and his son had a girlfriend or something like that. The only other part I remember this weird wooden soldier dude who moved like a weeping angel. It was trying to kill me.

So I had a nightmare I guess. I wasn‚Äôt scared when I woke up, but I was scared in the dream.

Ehh, my diary isn‚Äôt even a diary, it‚Äôs just like a random jumble of my thoughts. Sometimes I describe what happens in my day but rarely in sequence.

Maybe I‚Äôll do that today like I used to. I started writing in my diary in either October or November on an alt account. Then I stopped for a long time and picked back up in March.

So much has changed. I really want to go back and read those old ones now.

But I‚Äôll wait to do that.

...

Today was Tuesday.

I had a really hard time getting out of bed this morning. I realized I didn‚Äôt shower, and that I had my math final first thing when school starts.

But the real reason I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed was because I wouldn‚Äôt see F at any point today because of the schedule for finals.

I put my hair up in a bun to hide how gross it looked. Don‚Äôt know it that helped much anyways. I also realized I still hadn‚Äôt printed out my fitness log.

I realized I would see him in the cafeteria briefly and that gave me enough hope to get up and dressed. I just wore some black jeans, sandals, and that stupid sweatshirt I got from Portland. It was comfortable at least.

It was still raining when I left so I brought an umbrella. That stupid broken one I‚Äôve had since I was a kid. I really need a nice umbrella, but I don‚Äôt want to pay for it.

I got to school, went to the cafeteria, passed F without a word and sat down like I do every morning. Soon Clara came in and sat next to me. Suddenly we‚Äôre friends. Like, I never talked to her when the seniors were still here, but she‚Äôs super chill. She helped me with logarithms a bit.

I left the cafeteria mad at the day to come. I took my math final. And I failed. I got a 43%. I didn‚Äôt realize this till later though.

Went to third hour, turned in my fitness log and a forged parent signature, and worked on a packing list for art camp. I need to buy a lot of stuff it turns out.

Went to fourth hour. I was kind of bummed that I wouldn‚Äôt even run into F in the cafeteria because he had a different floor for lunch. I checked my email while Mr. G was watching us while S was gone.

I checked my grades and I failed. I failed my math final. I failed second semester of the lower level algebra 2. I failed a class for the first time in my life.

But I‚Äôm not really fazed. I knew I was going to fail. But I was kind of worried what dad would say. He texted me later and was like, I failed my Junior year of math too, so I can‚Äôt really say anything.

But this means I‚Äôll have to take math next year so I went down to my counselor to bring her that green paper and talk to her about it. She said I‚Äôd only have to take a semester of consumer math. No biggie.

I went to lunch soon after that. I was gonna sit alone in the art hall, but I sat with Alex inside the cafeteria. I hadn‚Äôt really sat in there for lunch in a long time. He‚Äôs a good friend. One of the longest ones I‚Äôve had throughout my schooling years post- Rtn.

I had this grand idea on how I could have an excuse to talk to/see F today. Our last period of the day was a 55 min seminar. Most people had left already. We sat together goofing off outside his class. I waited outside until he went into his room. He looked at us, but I didn‚Äôt look at him. Later I went in to get a pass.

I asked if we could travel during seminar and he was confused, he didn‚Äôt know we even had a seminar. Leave it to F for not knowing the schedule.

He said sure and wrote me a pass. He said I was more than welcome to come hang out. He also said I didn‚Äôt have to sit out in the hall, but I said I was fine, I didn‚Äôt want to be the only one talking in his quiet class.

I went to my 5th hour. I was the only one who came. Mrs. H was having a meeting with some PTSA people.

And I went down to F‚Äôs room. I was like, ‚Äúman, no one is here either.‚Äù We didn‚Äôt talk much at all. I just made a little calendar in my notebook and messed around with my laptop. Oh, and Mrs. H said I could keep my computer over the summer. She put in a special request.

But we just sat in silence. Listening to his music on full blast. Alex C came by later and said hi. I‚Äôm gonna miss her next year.

Anyways, nothing notable was said, except he asked if I listened to Nirvana and I said not really. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like Nirvana, I just haven‚Äôt listened to them yet. Same goes for all of his other music. I love his music taste. I just am a bit of an inexperienced music baby.

Like a minute before school was out, I asked about the final for art. I asked if it was on classroom, and he said it‚Äôs been on there for a few weeks lol. He was like, you need to get on that! I said I would. Then I made some snarky remark about how much I hate finals and then I said he said bye and I left.

Went home. Went to work. Now I‚Äôm here.

Woo hoo.

While writing this I just wondered if I should do my power project. Colleges look at my grades, and especially my art grades. It would do me good to have a good grade in art. If I turned this in and my final I‚Äôd probably have a 95 in the class.

I just don‚Äôt know WHAT to make.

I‚Äôll think about it tonight. I‚Äôll draw in my head. I‚Äôll figure out technicalities tomorrow.

I‚Äôll have to also do my art final tomorrow.

Jeez this was long. I‚Äôm gonna go do something else."
0,"21.05.19. What‚Äôs the opposite of wise?
People often tell me I‚Äôm wise.

It happens all the time. Has my whole life.

My friends tell me. My teachers have told me. Hell, even my parents have told me that I‚Äôm occasionally insightful.

(Usually with them, it‚Äôs long after the fact, of course.)

But I don‚Äôt think I hear it more often than I do on the internet.

Because, on the internet, everything has the potential to be ignored.

So when my thoughts get a reaction, good or bad, I know it‚Äôs genuine.

And when they don‚Äôt, I know it‚Äôs not personal.

So I tend to speak up more on the internet.

Instead of just thinking my thoughts in my head, I share them. Just... put them out there, since there‚Äôs no pressure. Nobody‚Äôs listening. That‚Äôs not the point.

Honestly, it‚Äôs hardly any different from thinking inside my head. If anything, typing my thoughts out makes them better.

Makes me stay clear and to the point.

(I have a tendency to spiral. Writing helps, even if only because eventually my hands get tired.)

The only difference with putting my thoughts on the internet instead of just having them in my head is that I‚Äôve shared them.

So all of a sudden, I‚Äôve found myself getting a lot of feedback, more than I‚Äôve ever gotten before.

Feedback from *other people*.

To *me*.

On my *thoughts*.

*My* thoughts!

And here‚Äôs the crazy part: their feedback is positive!

Not all the time. That would be stupid. But without a doubt, the majority of the feedback I get is good.

On my *thoughts*!

What the fuck?

People are *listening* to me.

What the fuck??

And not only that - they *like* me, too!

What the *fuck*???

A lot of the feedback I get is that I‚Äôm wise.

I truly, to my core, cannot believe that people value the things I say. That they *want* to take my advice.

But it‚Äôs happened enough times now that I‚Äôd be a hypocrite if I didn‚Äôt admit that maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Maybe I should believe it.

But that‚Äôs fucking terrifying.

I don‚Äôt *feel* wise.

Wise people are Buddhist monks who sit and smile and don‚Äôt speak for 45 years, and when they finally do they get a Nobel Peace Prize for what they have to say.

Wise people are wrinkly old grandparents who close their eyes and lean back in their leather armchair, sighing softly before they start telling their stories.

Wise people have already been through life, and come out stronger. That‚Äôs how they got wise.

But I‚Äôm the opposite of that. I‚Äôm not old - I‚Äôm still a teenager!

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about.

I haven‚Äôt come out stronger.

I‚Äôm not even finished yet.

I‚Äôm still right in the thick of it.

Why the fuck are people listening to me?

They shouldn‚Äôt be doing that!

But they do.

And they don‚Äôt care how I feel about it.

Nobody‚Äôs listening to me because they think they should, or because I‚Äôve tricked them into it.

No one is listening to me because they have to.

They‚Äôre just listening because they want to.

It has nothing to do with who I am at all.

They just like what I have to say.

It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

If I was wise, it would make sense.

What‚Äôs the opposite of wise? That‚Äôs what I feel like."

I don't feel like writing anything yesterday.
Well, some weird things happened yeaterday. Before going to my institute I opened my old box full of dirt for old past papers. I was not sure for its existence there but thankfully I got it.

It's kinda booklet I opened it and flip some pages and I got myself again in my past.

I have been running so far from my past and it finds me from one way or another. I found her name there (She used to write her name on my books) and nostalgia hits me really hard . I erased her name felt like I can erase or undo her from my past.

Went to my institute took my class and hot back home ... Then slept for 5 hours .In evening I got a text from someone unknown she asked me for dinner out. I asked her who is she said she was in my class way back but I was unsure how is this possible my life is so fucked up. Then she said because 'she texted the wrong guy' then I felt like me again . Well, that was a static day..

....

Today, was a calm day with some hide and seek but went well."

Hey, I‚Äôm Null.

I decided to make a throwaway account where I just do this. Make diary entries on reddit for the world to see,
It‚Äôs weird. Because I can literally write anything, but it‚Äôs not private.

Well I mean it is, particularly. I‚Äôm behind a screen, and you get to sit and read what my day was, how I feel.
It‚Äôs kinda like a counselor, a therapist? I don‚Äôt really know.

All I really know is that life‚Äôs weird right now, probably not as bad as others. But it‚Äôs probably declined a lot in my perspective of my life in the past two months.

I‚Äôve just became distant, no one wants to really talk to me and I‚Äôm becoming meaner. I see it but I don‚Äôt really wanna stop it.
I‚Äôm exhausted and I just want to be out for summer, I think I might‚Äôve burnt myself out a bit.

My friends are becoming more distant.
Miki is being a bossy-bitch like always. Getting snappy at a game of cards, then she just moved tables and I wasn‚Äôt even invited into the same card game I was playing exactly a second ago.

Like what the hell Miki? I know you‚Äôre going into homeschooling but get your head out of your ass and actually be considerate you cactus with spikes so big and long they just touch to tip of the Canadian border.

I also think one of my teachers is becoming concerned for my mental health a bit, wouldn‚Äôt blame them but I‚Äôm fine mentally. Just angry I guess.

I don‚Äôt know, what‚Äôs wrong with me guys?
I just want to know what I‚Äôm doing wrong so I‚Äôm not miserable for gods sake."
0,"20.05.19. Calling home
My mom called me the other day. She got a survey in the mail about my psychological testing.

She said: ‚ÄúYou know, sometimes you do research about things you find on the internet and you convince yourself you have all these symptoms you maybe don‚Äôt have.‚Äù

So I said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt research the things, I research the symptoms that I have and it leads me to the things that explain the symptoms. And I‚Äôm not convincing myself of anything, I‚Äôm getting tested by a professional. That‚Äôs what the survey‚Äôs for. Just fill it out honestly and we‚Äôll see if or what I have.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm just saying. You‚Äôre not *learning disabled*. Sometimes you just make stuff up.‚Äù

So I said: ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll find out. Why did you call me?‚Äù

And she said: ‚ÄúI wanted your help answering these questions. Some of them are hard.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not supposed to answer them, you are. It prevents me from being able to make stuff up, so we can get a clearer picture of what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a learning disability.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThen put down that you haven‚Äôt seen me display any of the symptoms they‚Äôre asking about.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúBut you have a lot of these.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThen put down that you‚Äôve seen them.‚Äù

And she said: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not that simple! You make stuff up! These questions are *hard*, you know? Some of it really sounds like you, but some of it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúJust answer honestly. I‚Äôm allowed to have some of the symptoms and not others. I‚Äôm definitely not the most severe case they‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

(Although, the psychologist did say I was ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù. Which is *not* what you want to hear from a psychologist. But that‚Äôs another story.)

She said: ‚ÄúLike this one here: frequently gets overexcited or boisterous during fun activities. I‚Äôve never seen you get boisterous or excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI agree with that. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever seen me during fun activities. We don‚Äôt usually do that kind of stuff together.‚Äù

And we both kind of went quiet for a moment.

Then she said: ‚ÄúYes we do! You make stuff up. You just don‚Äôt get excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI get excited. Just not much around you, I guess. But if you don‚Äôt see it, put down that you don‚Äôt see it. You‚Äôre supposed to answer it honestly. Don‚Äôt want me making stuff up, right?‚Äù

Although, they were *her* survey answers, not mine. I already filled one out.

Still, better to just take the blame.

Makes it go faster.

She said: ‚ÄúFine. But when do you get excited?‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Whenever I‚Äôm enjoying myself. Same as everyone else, probably.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen you get excited.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù"

Second part.

Went out to dinner at JS with the grandparents. I ate a lot of really good food and I‚Äôll probably have the rest for dinner tomorrow or Wednesday.

I got a gift card from dad, and a gift card to Barnes and noble from grandma.

Grandma also got me a fucking electric razor‚Äî for shaving legs.

You‚Äôve GOT to be kidding me. My dad got me one last year too. And I almost got out for Christmas the year before last but I think it didn‚Äôt work.

Do they think I‚Äôve got hairy legs or something? They claim that‚Äôs not the case. They say it was a coincidence.

I‚Äôm kind of mad, but I don‚Äôt care because the gift cards were a blessing. I can finally buy that desk and make art over the summer.

Another thing I‚Äôve learned lately. Printmaking is a fucking expensive art. Plates alone make me broke, but now I‚Äôve gotta get ink, a hard ground, proper tools, and all this shit?????

I just don‚Äôt know if I can afford to make this type of art right now. I‚Äôll have to figure something out though. I want to prove I can do drypoint etchings. Maybe I just won‚Äôt do prints as my concentration. Just a few good ones in my breadth section. I can even use the plates I‚Äôve already bought if I use them wisely.

This summer is about saving money, and only buying what I need.

I need to save my money for camp, and for our trip to Santa Fe, and a car, and college. I was talking about it very vaguely in the car on the way to dinner. My sister mentioned OH yeah that trip dad probably won‚Äôt let you go on. And I said, why wouldn‚Äôt he let me go??

She‚Äôs fucking annoying as shit. I hate her sometimes.

But I can‚Äôt be mad.

...

I‚Äôve been reading on how to heal my scars. I don‚Äôt really want to go out and buy a scar healing cream because I‚Äôm trying to save $$.

I would if that‚Äôs my only option, but I read online that Burt‚Äôs bees hand salve can help heal scars. I‚Äôve got a little tub of that stuff and it‚Äôs THE SHIT. That stuff is SO moisturizing, and its all natural.

I rubbed some on my legs tonight. It‚Äôs going to be tough work healing that many scars. Why the fuck did I have to butcher my entire thighs.

I keep having this dream where I‚Äôm on the Santa Fe trip with the advanced placement art group with F.

And I‚Äôm at a point where my scars have faded enough to look older, and I‚Äôm comfortable wearing actual women‚Äôs shorts. And if someone questions me, I just give them a simple, ‚ÄúI did some stuff to myself I wasn‚Äôt proud of, but I‚Äôve moved past that now.‚Äù

And life is well and I‚Äôm so confident.

My other dream is where we‚Äôre at the hotel and we realize it has a pool. Later in the evening when we have ample time to do something, we all decide to go down to the pool.

I‚Äôm in my one piece swimsuit, but with my long, denim shorts on. Everyone is having a good time in the pool and I‚Äôm just sitting in a chair on the side.

In my dream, F comes down to join us by the pool because his job is to supervise us haha. I‚Äôm sitting alone and he walks over near me.

He says something like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not swimming??‚Äù

And I say something like. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

Then he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt swim?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo‚Äîno. I just‚Äî my legs, you know?‚Äù And I give him these big sad eyes.

And suddenly he understand, and says something like, ‚ÄúOh. You know it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I don‚Äôt think people are going to think of you worse if they know. You shouldn‚Äôt have to miss out on fun things like swimming.‚Äù

What he said in the dream was much shorter I think, but all I know is it filled me with so much courage. Someone in the pool calls to me later and I take off my shorts and get into the pool. No one really notices except for F, and if someone does, they don‚Äôt say a word or look at me any weirder.

I‚Äôm gonna go to bed right now so I will dream tonight.

I miss my mom on this day.

First birthday without her.

The last thing I remember hearing from her was a voicemail singing happy birthday to me.

But I lost that voicemail when my phone broke.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever hear her voice again."

Today is my birthday. I‚Äôm 17!

I woke up and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was my birthday. It just felt like the last Monday of the school year.

I got up, got dressed. But I was in a good mood.

I got a 100% on my history final which raised my grade to a D. I‚Äôm passing now! Thank god.

I didn‚Äôt do jack shit in math. I need to get a 60% or above to pass the class.

I need to remember to print out the fitness form for tomorrow for 3rd hour.

In 5th hour. Mrs. H bought us chipotle. She asked me if I could run down to the office to pick it up from the delivery person. So I did.

I got to the office and F was sitting in a chair talking to the receptionist. I was kind of confused, he was the last person I expected to see. F asked if I was leaving, he said he thought I was gone today. I was confused why he would think that because I didn‚Äôt have any of his earlier classes. Maybe he just didn‚Äôt see me at lunch I guess. He said happy birthday, and I said thanks. I explained that I was waiting to pick up Mrs. H‚Äôs chipotle.

I was happy to see him. I just sat in the chair opposite with my back to him holding Mrs. H‚Äôs phone in case the deliverer called. Sure enough they did, and I went outside to get it from her. She was super nice despite me being a delivery idiot.

I walked back in carrying the bag. I told F I brought cake for class and that it was in my locker.

So I went back upstairs, ate my burrito real fast, said bye and thanks to Mrs. H, and went down to art. I grabbed the lemon cake from my locker and went into class. There was some random lady with a visitor sticker talking to F. I offered them both some cake. They both had some.

She was SO NICE! I gathered that she was going to be a student teacher next year. Apparently she‚Äôs kind of like an apprentice taxidermist and stuff. So cool!!!!! No one else came to class except for L. But she was off doing something or another.

F brought up Santa Fe again. This time he‚Äôs got a real plan, I guess he talked to some more school people about it. We might go Oct. 3-6th. He is debating whether to rent a coach, take a train, or drive in a van. We can figure that out later though.

Ahh I can‚Äôt stop smiling. You were right overemotional, he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying..

My mind is so scattered rn  I can barely think.

So he talked to the lady some more, I never caught her name sadly.

She seems really nice.

So he left for almost all of 7th hour showing her around the art department and wood shop and stuff. Athena wandered into class and bugged the hell out of me. She‚Äôs nice but SO annoying.

I feel bad for her though.

When F came back after school i asked him a question about sketchbooks for AP Art next year. I also asked him if there were any local print places with a press I could use during the summer. I just wanted to bring up the idea of me maybe being able to come in a day or two to the classroom during summer. He told me about one local place. I actually know the lady who runs it because her husband is on my stepmoms sales team. We went to her solo show a few months ago.

It was kinda pricy to use the space there unfortunately.

F talked about the art camp thing I‚Äôm doing and we talked about that for a while. We debated what classes would be like etc. He said he was excited for me to be able to go. I think he‚Äôs hoping I get this printmaking shit figured out and I can come back and teach him.

We talked about stuff and things while I was waiting for my dad to pick me up. Damn, I love talking with him so much. He makes me smile so much. I don‚Äôt think I could smile bigger. He makes me feel important. ME, important to an adult I admire. God damn that feeling is fire.

We were talking about school and summer and stuff. He said he‚Äôd probably use the classroom a lot during the summer, he said I could come in and use the press if I wanted. He said he only lived like 5 minutes away. Then somehow we were talking about houses and he was like, you know, you live super close to my mom! He‚Äôs told me this a couple of times before but I never know for certain where she lives. I used to live literally one street away from her. Crazy. He said he thought he drove by my house the other day because he saw my dad our working in the garage.

(Side note: he knows my address because I bought something from him on PayPal that had to be delivered to my house. I can‚Äôt explain what because it might give away his identity.)

F drove by my house. HAHAHAHHA

F fucking knows where I live! I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm happy or embarrassed.

Anyways. We were talking about the digital media lab and how he was gonna organize it next year. He unlocked the room and he was walking around throwing out ideas on how he might organize it.

We talked about that for a bit, then my dad arrived and I said I had to go. I said I‚Äôd try not to bother him in the summer about coming in to work. He said he doesn‚Äôt want me to be nervous and think I‚Äôm imposing on him, that he‚Äôd love to hang out sometime and make art like we do sometimes.

I said ok. I can‚Äôt really describe what was said because what I remember never sounds right in words.  Anyways...

I left and like the whole cake was gone except for two or three slices.

So that‚Äôs my day so far, it‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôre gonna go out for dinner tonight.

I realize I never write EVERYTHING that happens to me in a day down. I just write about F a whole lot and I don‚Äôt really care anymore.

More goes on in my life besides worrying about him. But I just like to keep track. See how things have changed over time with him.


Gotta go now. Phones almost dead and stepmom is home.."
0,"19.05.19. I need a break
Today was a thinking day.

I didn‚Äôt do much, I just lay in bed or walked around.

But it didn‚Äôt feel like a total waste, because I spent the whole day thinking through a lot of things I had to think about.

I always have so much to fucking think about.

Anyways, it was nice to have the time alone.

I‚Äôve been making sure to hang out with people for at least a little bit every day.

But today, I don‚Äôt think I talked to a single person.

Actually, that‚Äôs not true- there was one phone call.

But overall, it was a nice, quiet day. Had its ups and downs, as always. At the very least, I have lots of writing material for tomorrow if I feel like going through it all again later.

But right now, I feel good.

I really needed a day all to myself.

I wish I knew how to balance these alone days with social days so I don‚Äôt fall into total isolation again.

Seeing people every single day is exhausting.

But I guess killing yourself out of loneliness is worse.

Although, I‚Äôm not so sure I would be killing myself out of loneliness anymore. I think that was more a part of my past attempts.

This time, I would just do it cuz I‚Äôm tired.

Sometimes I just wish I could have a break.

It‚Äôs nice to know people care about me.

I know they would be sad if I died. Last time, I figured it would be fine if I killed myself because no one would even notice. And even if they did, who would care?

It used to feel like I was doing people a favour.

Now I know that‚Äôs not true.

They want me here.

But I wonder, if they really care about me, wouldn‚Äôt they just want what‚Äôs best for me?

When I worked at the vet clinic, we used to put animals down all the time. If they were suffering, we did what was best for them, even if it was hard for us.

I‚Äôm suffering, too.

If I could just find a way to make everyone understand, then maybe they won‚Äôt be sad.

And I can die in peace."

Sometimes when I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening with my life I just turn to this subreddit to write it out. Writing things down keeps me calm‚Äîish.

My phone has 8% and I‚Äôm stuck in some graduation ceremony for church. I don‚Äôt know why we had to come tonight. I‚Äôm freezing because I wore my long shorts. Long they may be, I‚Äôve got goosebumps.

Today was okay. We went to Target after church today. I didn‚Äôt buy a single thing. I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself. When I got home I made a lemon bundt cake for art tomorrow. I mentioned something about my birthday and F said, I‚Äôd it your birthday??

I was like, no, it‚Äôs on Monday. He asked if I was bringing cake. I said I could.

So I baked a cake. I hope it turns out okay. It called for a cup of sour cream which I can‚Äôt imagine being good in a cake.

While it was in the oven I started working on my final for history class. I have an outline for what I‚Äôm doing. Women‚Äôs rights. Yay. I‚Äôll have to finish it tonight after this damn graduation ceremony.

At around 3:30 I was about ready to take a break so I checked my phone. I had a message from F. It was about my grades and stuff for class.

He asked where my power project was, I told him I didn‚Äôt do it and gave him the reason why.

My project idea had to do with the pressure I feel like my adult life has to be. Some boring lower middle class christian, cookie cutter life. About marriage and shit.

And I don‚Äôt know that I feel the same way about having a family anymore. And I said that, kinda. I kind of want a family. But I‚Äôm at this moral crossroads. A religious fork in the road.

I gotta pick shit now. I‚Äôve been on this fucking vacation from my faith and I‚Äôve only got one ticket back and it‚Äôs almost expired.

I could get back into the word, run back to my church, to my God. Someday get married, have children. Be a housewife. Live a content life. Die happily and go to heaven.

Or I could live a fun life. I could be who I am. I can listen to rock. Make art, no matter how secular the topic. I could enjoy the pleasures of life. Maybe if I‚Äôm lucky find a man like me. Have some kids even. Become famous or something. My life could be WHATEVER I wanted it to be. But go to hell. In eternal torment. For fucking ever.

But I don‚Äôt even want to think about that. I just wanna make it through college. I just want to make it TO college. Then I can figure out who I am. Who I want to be. Who I should be even.

So anyways, he convinced me to make something. Anything at all to turn in. I can‚Äôt turn just anything in though. My pride is too big. If I‚Äôm gonna turn in something half-assed, it‚Äôs gotta be decent. And I have no decent ideas.

At the end of our short conversation, he just said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll think of something.‚Äù

So I‚Äôve been thinking. For three hours now. So far all I‚Äôve got as far as the power project is some loose ideas about the power religion has over me. Or even the power the voices in my head/my anxiety has over me.

Which is something I‚Äôve kind of been thinking about the last day or so.

I just wish I didn‚Äôt have a fucking art project on my plate right now. I need to do my real school. But I don‚Äôt want to disappoint F.

I feel really shitty now and I want to cut. But I don‚Äôt want to, because I promised myself I‚Äôd stop. I just want to hit myself. A nice bruise on the wrist would be okay. I haven‚Äôt bruised myself in a while. I got worried I cracked some bone in my wrist last time because of the swelling.

Anyways. My phones gonna die. Sunday‚Äôs suck. I always end up feeling really shitty. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint F. But I want to pass my classes.

I need to start thinking about my project. While some big eared guy tells a bunch of college grads to serve the lord faithfully through their life."

Well, technically its 20 may exactly 4:15AM . The day went pretty good actually. Finally, after 14 days I gotta eat biryani one of my fav food (Sunday meal) but last Sunday it wasn't there.


Just an ordinary day no outing nothing ..
After just 3 hours I have my Financial Accounts class at 8AM

Thoughts right now : Should I sleep for 2 hours or keep myself awake.
My friend asked for past papers I have to keep that in my bag

Update : so I have decided to watch 21 Jump Street. It might keep me awake till 7."

I always wanted to have a Diary, a real diary.

Yes mom and dad, a real diary. Not just a notebook that was lying around the house.

But I guess that I will start now, 23 years later, because you guys were too crummy."
0,"The only reason I still post on Re**it is the obligatory upvote.
With most of my comments usually getting downvoted to hell, the single automatic upvote is the only thing which encourages me to bother commenting in the first place.

Add to that the frustration auto-bots dish out from swift deletion of topics.

I think I‚Äôm beginning to understand it now: with the ability for people to downvote opinions comes an apprehension for peers to participate in discussions. Hence an automatic upvote was created as a form encouragement.

I believe if the one-free-upvote system is removed this forum will face a considerable reduction in the amount of members posting thoughts and responses."

my day yesterday would be considered fair. i worked 6 hours and seen a few cute customers. i joked around alot at work and smiled more. the customers noticed me smiling and they loved it. other than that, work was work. i felt better for a brief moment and now im back into depression. i don't have the energy and desire to write the full details of my day.  i been looking into online courses and videos on how to improve my writing and speaking skills but procrastination wins each time.

i talked to my dad for the first time today in two weeks. it was a decent 10 minute chat. hopefully i can meet him in person. he was never there for me but i would like to get to know my dad's side of the family.

i am looking into online jobs. i just have to make sure they are legit and not bullshit. i need another part- time hustle to cover my extra expenses. i just have to make sure it balance out between my regular job and school. i need all the money i can get. i could also use the extra money for therapy.

the next goal is online jobs."

Lol, I can‚Äôt believe how I dissed work last night. Yeah‚Äî it sucks at times. It‚Äôs work. But everyone there is like a second family to me. We act like a big goofy, dysfunctional family.

Who knew a midwestern fast food joint could be a home to me? I never would have expected. AD is a great boss. I‚Äôm even trying to pick up some Spanish to be able to communicate with the guys in the kitchen better. They‚Äôre so nice to me.

It rained a lot today, then it pooped out later in the afternoon and stopped for the day. So work was pretty slow. And I didn‚Äôt have to do headset but for like 15 mins to cover Josue on break.

...

Anyways. I‚Äôm just laying in my bed. My blinds are open but there is no light. The moon is hidden by the dense clouds. If it weren‚Äôt for the streetlight it‚Äôd be pitch dark outside.

I looked for some pajamas or something to wear to bed and grabbed my shorts. The athletic ones. The ones I‚Äôll never be able to wear again. Because I made some really shitty mistakes.

I want to be able to wear shorts and not be judged. I bet I could even have the confidence to wear shorts at school/out in public soon.

But I just can‚Äôt risk it getting back to my parents. I secretly wished they knew sometimes and I didn‚Äôt have to worry.

I don‚Äôt know if there will ever be a point where I can wear normal shorts around my family. Or even out in public. I was looking at some of the oldest scars on my thighs. They‚Äôre barely visible. But then again, they probably weren‚Äôt very deep. I don‚Äôt even know where the ‚Äúoldest‚Äù ones are because there are so fucking many.

Maybe I should just stop.

I don‚Äôt WANT to cut my legs open.

I just do it.

I used to have reasons.

Now I just cut because I feel like I have to.

But I don‚Äôt HAVE to. Do I?

I might invest in some scar healing cream. I‚Äôm going to do some research now. Maybe I‚Äôll ask in r/selfharm

Anyways. Goodnight. I never expected people to read my diary entries. It‚Äôs like venting to the void, but sometimes the void talks back and is really smart."

It‚Äôs been getting harder not to kill myself.

At the testing session yesterday I even accidentally got flagged as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù. They sent someone in to talk to me and everything.

That really freaked me out.

I‚Äôve already been having a tough time with panic attacks between my bouts of sad, empty nothingness, but having them confront me about it so directly just sent me through the roof.

Later that afternoon, something in me snapped.

I dug out an old phone number and sent a text asking if they still did same-day drug pickups.

They did.

I threw out over $200 worth of weed, acid, shrooms, and all related equipment - everything I had - almost a month ago.

I thought it would make it too hard to get my hands on stuff during my cravings, and so I would have to stop for good out of my own sheer laziness.

20 minutes and $50 later, I had everything I needed.

But honestly, just getting it was enough. By the time I was walking back, watching the sun set, I felt good.

I ended up taking my housemate over to a friend‚Äôs house to watch anime. Something dark and twisted. We‚Äôve all been having tough times lately.

That was yesterday.

This morning I woke up, still sober and still suicidal. But not the kind of suicidal that you act on (except in certain moments, but those almost always pass).

I‚Äôm *not* ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù.

I could tell by how I was feeling that today was not going be particularly fun or productive.

So I told myself: *You just need to get out of bed.*

And then I thought: *I can‚Äôt.*

So I told myself: *You can get high. Remember? You already bought a bag yesterday. It‚Äôs all right there, ready for use. Just get out of bed.*

And then I thought: *Ok.*

So I got out of bed.

Then I remembered that I couldn‚Äôt just smoke and chill, because I had lost my house key and had to get a new copy before my housemate needed hers back.

So I told myself: *Just run this quick, tiny errand. Do this one thing, and you can take the rest of the day off. You can even get high - you‚Äôll have earned it.*

So I thought: *Fine.*

And I walked to Canadian Tire.

It‚Äôs a pretty far walk, but I decided against the bus.

Buses give me anxiety when they get too crowded, and when I get like this I have less control over myself than usual.

Better to walk, especially on the weekend when the streets are mostly empty.

Plus, it wasn‚Äôt like I had anything else to do today. I could take as long as I wanted.

The walk made me feel a little better, especially with all the dandelion blooms.

It was like walking through a million tiny suns, all reflecting circles of bright yellow under the warmth of the sunshine overhead.

It made me feel a little less horrible.

After I got my key cut, I realized I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, so I decided to get lunch before I went home.

My favourite chain restaurant was nearly empty, so I figured I‚Äôd stay a while.

I headed to the furthest booth in the back and sat up against the corner, hidden away from the world.

Listening to a podcast, eating my burger, and sitting at a table bathed in sunlight from a nearby window, I finally started to feel the cloud lift.

Not a lot, but a little, which is more than nothing. And definitely more than enough to be grateful for.

I started to think I might not need to get high after all. It was nice to have options, but I wanted to stay sober as long as I could.

I didn‚Äôt want to end up like how I was only a few months ago: failing out of school, too depressed for even basic functions, unable to leave the house or sometimes even my bedroom without intense anxiety, and totally dependent on substances just to keep staying alive.

I knew how easy it would be to slip back into old habits. And I was determined to change them.

It was nice to feel like that again.

Sometimes it gets hard for me to stay hopeful.

I decided I‚Äôd go to the library and try to focus on math when I got home, instead of just getting high and going back to bed. So I could get better.

Then a shadow fell over my table and a voice said: ‚ÄúThose onion rings look delicious.‚Äù

I looked up to see a strange middle-aged man towering over my booth, cornering me in against the wall. He was grinning down at me in earnest.

He seemed very friendly; eager to please.

Maybe a little *too* eager to please.

Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

My instincts took over.

I mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, do you want one?‚Äù

He smiled even bigger, if that was possible.

‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt you a sweet little thing,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very nice of you to offer.‚Äù

Then he walked off.

My heart was pounding, but I shook it off.

He was probably just a little weird. He hadn‚Äôt given me any reason to believe he wanted to hurt me. How was he supposed to know how afraid I was?

I had to calm down.

It wasn‚Äôt fair to act like he was evil just for starting a conversation. I‚Äôve always been the kind of person random people just start talking to. This guy was no different.

He probably just wanted someone to talk to.

Plus, he was gone now.

I went back to eating.

I scrolled through my phone, but I didn‚Äôt even know what I was looking at. My mind was elsewhere. I tried to just focus on my feed and take some deep breaths.

Until he came back.

This time, he came from behind me and put a hand on my shoulder. I was too afraid to even startle properly.

I just froze.

He said: ‚ÄúBy the way, my name‚Äôs James. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù

I told him.

He said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lovely name for a lovely girl. It is lovely to meet you.‚Äù

He stuck out his hand for a handshake, but didn‚Äôt stop when his hand was fully extended. He just kept leaning in until he could grab my hand.

Then he shook it, gripping it tight.

His hand was wet.

He said: ‚ÄúI just washed my hands. But I promise I‚Äôm nice and clean for you; it‚Äôs still safe to eat your food. And you‚Äôll want to, those look pretty yummy!‚Äù

Suddenly, just the thought of eating those onion rings made me sick.

I said: ‚ÄúThose actually just came with my combo, but I‚Äôm full. You can have them if you want.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúReally? Are you sure?‚Äù

I nodded.

He could have anything he wanted if it meant he would leave me alone.

‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù He grinned, and grabbed them off the table.

He bit down on one and made a big show of how much he was enjoying them.

I didn‚Äôt care; I was just glad that both his hands were being kept busy and off of me.

Keeping my gaze on the table, I pretended to scroll through my phone and disengage. I couldn‚Äôt even feel my fingers from the stress.

Then he tapped me again, and I looked up.

His face was right in mine.

Grinning.

He said: ‚ÄúYou know, I do insurance. Here‚Äôs my card, send me a text if you ever need anything.‚Äù

He grabbed my hand and put a business card into it.

Then, still holding my hand, he looked right into my eyes and smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to hear from you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

I didn‚Äôt even move.

Eventually, he got bored and dropped my hand to wander off with my food. I stayed completely frozen.

I don‚Äôt know how much time passed.

At some point, I heard my name called out from across the restaurant.

It was him, wanting my attention so he could wave goodbye on his way out the door.

I forced a polite smile and lifted my hand into a brief pseudo-wave.

Then I went right back to staring at the table.

Once he left, I had a full-on meltdown in the back-corner booth of a burger joint.

Guess I‚Äôm *that* girl now.

Why am I so fucking dramatic?

Nothing even happened.

It took me almost two hours to muster up the courage to leave the restaurant.

I was so afraid he would be waiting outside to catch me, drag me out back and do what he wanted with me.

I‚Äôm so fucking fragile.

Just like that, all my progress was undone.

I couldn‚Äôt calm down.

It‚Äôs pathetic.

The next thing I remember is sitting out in the backyard, bowl in hand.

I breathed deeply and felt that familiar harshness in my chest. Coughed a lot- my lungs had forgotten how it felt to smoke.

Then a wave of calm washed over me, and I could enjoy the sunshine and dandelions again.

How did I ever function without this?"

I was up the whole night yesterday and slept in the morning and get up at 4 pm in the evening with the headache.

Thank God, I take classes just 3 days a week and summers here are just soo hot ( above 30 c every time)

0,"7:56 AM 5/18/19
I didn‚Äôt write anything last night although I should have.

I just fell asleep looking for clothes on H&M.

Yesterday didn‚Äôt feel like Friday. Today does not feel like Saturday. Time is warped. Four more days of school.

I‚Äôm gonna do my history final on Sunday. Print out my fitness log on Sunday and sign it.
Study for my math final on Monday. Which sucks because it‚Äôs my birthday. And then study for my English test Tuesday. Make that fucking band poster Tuesday. And do my art final Wednesday night.

I really should call in sick on Tuesday, but I need every extra dollar I can get right now.

Anyways that was more of a personal note for myself.

Yesterday was pretty average. We didn‚Äôt do jack shit all day. Except for a ‚Äúprivilege walk‚Äù in history. Even in art, I just sat there for two whole periods. I tried to be productive, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to be. I wore my black shorts I made myself. The ones that are just barely long enough to cover my scars, but if I sit a certain way, they show.

And I sat in that certain way in art. Because I‚Äôm an attention whore who just wants F to ask how I‚Äôm doing. He didn‚Äôt comment. But if I were him I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything either because we all know what happened last time.

At the end of 7th hour, I had him sign my independent study paper again. I told him I‚Äôd spilled something on my other yesterday and I texted him asking if he was gonna be at school today. It was a desperate way to do it, but I just had to know if he was gonna be there.

I put my stuff together to leave, and kind of awkwardly stood there looking at my phone. I nervously asked if I could wait in his classroom for my dad because it‚Äôs kind of hot and humid out. I said my dad would be here in 20 mins and couldn‚Äôt pick me up yet because he had someone over at the house.

Which was a total lie. I just didn‚Äôt want to leave yet. If I‚Äôm staying after school I try not to talk too much. Only if he initiates it.

He was working on scrubbing out the sink. He said something about his cat being old and he forgot and she didn‚Äôt land right when he nudged her off the kitchen counter yesterday. He said he felt really bad about it. Then he asked if I have any pets. I told him I did, well, I technically do, they were just with my uncle. And my dog is with some coworker of his.

He seemed confused but I think he fit the pieces together about my mom.

I got kinda sad, I really miss them.

We also talked about cars and driving and I mentioned that we were selling my moms old car so I could use the money towards one of my own. He asked what kind of car, and if it still worked. I said it still worked fine. And then he was like, can‚Äôt you just drive that? And I‚Äôm like well..... I could I just.. and then he was like ... or you just don‚Äôt want to drive it. I understand.

Oh and also during class we talked more about our trip for next year. He, like me, looked up the driving time to Santa Fe and realized it was like 12+ hours. Then I mentioned we could take a train. He said that was a good idea, I could tell I really got some gears turning. He said he‚Äôs never been on a train in the US. I said it was pretty easy and stuff. Just hop on at Union Station, and you‚Äôre off.

He looked up train ticket prices to Santa Fe, and they were like 130$ a pop.

We were throwing around ideas as a class and he brought up renting a charter bus. Immediately I was like, that‚Äôd be way too expensive. Those things aren‚Äôt cheap, plus they‚Äôre probably way too big for a group of 10ish people.

That got us talking about how awful greyhound busses are. And then he was like, are trains creepy and stuff? He asked if there was much difference between a train and a greyhound. I said there really wasn‚Äôt much difference except the train goes faster, and the people usually aren‚Äôt so crazy.

He realized if we tried to do this on a three day weekend during the school year, we wouldn‚Äôt have hardly any time at all there. For example, leave early Friday morning. Get there Friday evening. Go to bed. Then we would have all of Saturday there. Then Sunday we would leave early in the morning and get home Sunday night before school. It just doesn‚Äôt make much sense to do a whole trip for only ONE day.

Then he thought about doing it in summer, like right after school gets out. And at first, I was like, darn, that‚Äôs so far away. But when I got home I was thinking about it and it would be so much better to do it after school got out next year.

I‚Äôd be graduated, already 18, and by late May next year, I‚Äôd already have left F. But then surprise! We‚Äôre going on a senior trip. A last hurrah so to speak.

I plan on writing him the most heartfelt thank you letter he‚Äôs ever laid his eyes on next year when I leave. I‚Äôll give it to him the last day of school.

BUT THEN, awesome senior trip with the gang a few weeks later! And by then, he will have read my letter and might finally understand how much he has meant to me.

Ahh I‚Äôm so excited for next year.

But I gotta get serious about my art right now. After finals anyways.

So much to do.

And now I‚Äôve gotta go work for 10 hours.

And I cut myself more last night. I don‚Äôt even know why.

Fuckkkkkk this"

edit, 12:39. exhauated but cant sleep. i hear a train outside , i love to lislten to them, i like trains. 12:40. the dog sighed, shes supposed to be in her crate but she got out because she was scared of the storm, storms over now but she gets to sleep in my room. 12:41. sitting here wanting to say more but im empty, out of emotions to spill. 12:42, train horn, another one and another and another and anotherm hes leaving the train yard, probably heading to the east coast. 12:43, maybe i should write a blog, i had one and never used it. would anyone even read it? maybe this comment should be a post all its own. another train horn, another. and more and more. i dont know what they mean anymore, not at 12:44. 12:45. you can tell i live in the midwest, because i say goodbye or goodnight 6 times before i actually go or sleep. 12:46. writing everything i think is like sleeping. but sleeping is more like sleeping. closing the laptop now. train horn. its far away now, hardly within earshot. 12:47. like the train horn i drift off. goodnight.

i ended up getting 2 hours of sleep last night. i just sat and listened to the trains. and eventually forced myself to sleep"

Today I had three iced coffees. The cashiers at Tim Horton‚Äôs know me on sight now.

It didn‚Äôt help.

I‚Äôm still exhausted.

I‚Äôm tired when I wake up.

I spend all day tired and achy.

Force myself to stay up as long as I can.

Usually I alternate between doing calculus and hanging out with whichever friend is around and wants to chill.

The only time I really feel awake is when the panic attacks kick in. Then I‚Äôm wired- adrenaline will do that to you. But those are miserable, and when they‚Äôre over I‚Äôm even more exhausted.

Then I go to sleep and try my best not to dream.

It almost never works.

I really miss weed.

...

Update:

It‚Äôs now past midnight, so of course I‚Äôm wide awake.

All I want to do is sleep.

So why can‚Äôt I?

...I wonder if it has something to do with the three iced coffees I had today.

Maybe caffeine just takes a long time to kick in.

Like, twelve hours.

Hmm, maybe that‚Äôs not it.

Guess it‚Äôs just anxiety."

So we had Panda Express for lunch

I did a whole lot of nothing today

Played email tag with my counselor about schedule changes for next year.

And F replied to my message. He said what I thought he‚Äôd say. I don‚Äôt know why I made such a big deal about it.

I went to talk to my counselor about schedule stuff during 7th hour. I think I‚Äôve got things figured out. I just want to be in 5th and 6th. That‚Äôs my priority.

I realized I might need to use the classroom a day or two later in June for the press. Why did I have to choose such a complicated concentration idea?

He said he‚Äôd be in the classroom during summer making photos and stuff.

He told lily and I this hilarious story about this kid shitting his pants back when he taught elementary school.

OH! And I think he decided where he wants to go if we did a trip. Santa Fe! How fun. We would go to Meow Wolf, look at galleries and museums/other touristy stuff. Maybe do a workshop in Albuquerque.

Lily brought up the topic of personality types. Specifically Meyer-Briggs. She asked F what type he was. He said he‚Äôd taken it a long time ago and forgot.

Somehow we got him to look at the website. I told him I thought he was totally an ENFP. He was just looking at the brief summary of some of the other types and I don‚Äôt think he really connected with the ENFP.

He took the test and got INFP. I was close! I told him we were INFP buddies.

Suddenly everything made sense. F is just like me in a lot of ways. He said he‚Äôd read the profile when he got home.

I wonder if he thought about me... when reading the personality profile. Obviously himself because it was his results...  but he knows that I‚Äôm an INFP as well.  Just a hopeful thought.

I screen printed a T-shirt with a brayer design on it. I‚Äôm thinking about doing another tomorrow.

I‚Äôll coat the screen in seminar. Then do the rest in class/after school.

Today was a good day. F always makes it better.

I just want to get into his head, I want to understand what drives him. What his goals are‚Äî speaking of goals, lily was talking about his teaching job and stuff, and he asked him what his absolute dream job would be besides teaching. He said he loves teaching, but his real dream is to have a photography/printmaking studio with a gallery and studio and stuff.

And that‚Äôs funny‚Äî because that‚Äôs very similar to my ideal dream job. If I could be doing anything, it‚Äôd be the same exact thing. Except with printmaking or drawing.

Great minds think alike. Or INFP‚Äôs think alike.

It‚Äôs a great comfort knowing we have something in common.

Knowing that I COULD be like him someday.

That‚Äôs all I really long for."

My problems seem so shallow sometimes.

My issues worthless.

And they probably are. ‚Äî I know they are.

And I‚Äôm almost ashamed of myself. No‚Äî I am. I am ashamed of myself.

I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for exploiting him for attention. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for squeezing every last drop of notice out of him.

I‚Äôm ashamed for a great deal of other things. But this one takes the cake in this last year of my life.

My obsession has led me to desperation.

...

I found out that advanced art was no longer 6th and 7th period next year. Rather 5th and 6th. My head went into panic mode trying to figure out how to fix it. I just want to be in both sections. But I want to be in 7th hour as well.

I don‚Äôt want to drop digital design. Mrs. H has been so good to me. She‚Äôs literally buying the remaining class Panda Express tomorrow. How could I ever tell her I‚Äôm dropping her class next year.

First I dropped creative writing with Mrs. A. One of the most kind teachers ever. Now Mrs. H.

All a sacrifice to be with F.

I‚Äôll drop 5th hour Digital Design and replace it with AP Studio Art.

I‚Äôll do my independent study 6th hour.

I confessed to F that I really wanted to be in both sections of advanced art. But I told him that would leave me without a 7th hour. I asked if he needed a lab aid.

He said sure! Then he said that since it was the drawing 1 class, that I‚Äôd have to model for them now and then. For drawing.

I was surprised I could be a drawing model. I‚Äôm not exactly model material. I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô lump of flesh with pancake flat dyed ginger hair with bangs. Not to mention I‚Äôm borderline obese. Just on the edge. I have bad posture and horrible fashion sense.

But he said I would make a good model. I felt just horrible for asking to be a lab aid. That‚Äôs three classes in a row with him. I hope I didn‚Äôt come across as weird.

Then it hit me‚Äî I‚Äôd also signed up for photography with him. That‚Äôs four fuckin‚Äô classes a day with him.

I said that aloud. (Not the fuckin‚Äô part but you get the idea.)

Before I left I asked if it was okay‚Äî taking so many classes and stuff. I said I didn‚Äôt want to take up so many of his classes etc.

He said he would love to have me. Or something along those lines. Maybe I‚Äôm just wishing he said that.

But I felt embarrassed. Excited but embarrassed. The excitement was barely there. A mere seed, left unwatered.

I left. Went home. Got ready for work in a hurry. And I wrote him a message and sent him it on GroupMe.

...

‚ÄúAbout the whole lab aiding thing for 7th hour, if you‚Äôve got someone who‚Äôd be a better drawing model wanting to do it, don‚Äôt feel like you have to pick me. I‚Äôm not exactly model material if you know what I mean. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to do it, I‚Äôd be totally up for it! I just don‚Äôt want you to be stuck with me if there‚Äôs someone better suited.

And if I‚Äôm imposing on too many of your classes please tell me. I feel like I already bother you a ton and the last thing I want to be is annoying.

I just wanted to run this by you before I ask the counselor to change my schedule. I‚Äôm really sorry, and thanks for putting up with so much of me all the time.‚Äù

...

And it seemed like a good idea. At the time. And it did. For a few hours.

What‚Äôs worse is it says read 3:59 PM.

It‚Äôs 9:25 PM and no response.

And that‚Äôs why I wonder if it was a bad idea. And that‚Äôs why I feel gross. I feel like I‚Äôm exploiting F to make myself feel better about myself.

No‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing!! I‚Äôm so disgusting. I‚Äôm a disgusting addict. An addict who‚Äôs found the perfect source. Reliable.

All I aimed to get out of that was for him to tell me that I‚Äôd be a fine model. And that I don‚Äôt annoy him at all.

Because THATS THE TRUTH.

That‚Äôs what he believes. And I know it. And I know he knows it. And I know that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd tell me. (If he responded.)

I know he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying. I think. He made the new group chat for next years group and I was the first person and only person he added. I was sitting on the couch in Mrs. H‚Äôs room and I smiled so big. I think I teared up.

It‚Äôs the small things like that. Being added to the group chat first. Things like that make me feel like I‚Äôve actually done something with my life. It sounds so dull when I talk about it. But it just meant SO much to me.

He means so much to me.

...

ALSO BIG TEA TIME.

I‚Äôll keep it short because idgaf.

So J started talking about H and who he liked etc. Then as we talked I realized every other person in the room besides H knows how much M loves him and wants to be in a relationship with him. But we all know that H likes her but they‚Äôre both too scared to say anything.

Typical teenage love story‚Äî but it‚Äôs so friggin cute. It was just hilarious because like 5 of us girls were all in on it. J eventually told H that M liked him, after he confessed to liking M.

We all were soooo loud and so fucking excited. F looked so confused.

I‚Äôve never been happier for the two of them. They‚Äôre gonna make a cute couple. I really hope they make each other happy.

...

But back to reality.

F has not responded and I‚Äôm so ashamed. I‚Äôm trying not to be mad because he probably just isn‚Äôt on his phone. Life happens, stuff happens. He‚Äôs a busy guy.

Ugh. Anyways.

Athena is gonna be in AP next year. She‚Äôs so fucking annoying. Not in a naggy way, but a weird kind of way. Just the way she talks and the things she does. She‚Äôs so fucking weird and I don‚Äôt hate her. Hell I invited her to CC two years ago. She‚Äôs a nice kid don‚Äôt get me wrong.

I just don‚Äôt want to let her into our little class. Our little family.

And the same goes to a bunch of people. Fucking Jake of all people is taking Art Portfolio. JAKE?!

I am so afraid for the future. I‚Äôm so excited. But I‚Äôm sad that this year is dead and dying. I miss the seniors. I miss it all.

I texted Ellie today. I miss her too even though she graduated last year.

I miss it all.

I‚Äôm ashamed of myself.

I‚Äôm scared for the future.

But it‚Äôs a selfish fear.

A fear I feel I shouldn‚Äôt have the right to feel.

...

I just want him to respond to me. Or else tomorrow is gonna be awkward as HELL.

Update 9:53 PM:

It dawned on me. He‚Äôs been at graduation.
Wow I‚Äôm the supreme dumbass.

Way to go."

I was sitting at the table with my headphones on, eating my family‚Äôs leftovers for dinner.

We were on vacation. Earlier, I had been banished from attending the fancy restaurant we had booked.

My mom addressed the situation logically.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming to dinner,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúYou look like a homeless person. This is a nice restaurant; it would be embarrassing for us to be seen with you. We‚Äôll bring you leftovers, your brother always orders too much anyways.‚Äù

...Nothing she said was wrong.

I was just happy to have an excuse to stay behind.

It had been getting harder for me to hide the fact that I was only eating 450 calories a day when I had to eat every meal with my family.

That, coupled with my intense fear of leaving my room to interact with the outside world, had been making our nightly family vacation dinners tough.

Plus, getting some alone time - after spending nearly two weeks non-stop with only my family - sounded more like a reward than a punishment.

Although, I wasn‚Äôt sure it was meant to be a punishment at all.

If my mom had wanted me to change my clothes, all she had to do was ask. She knew I would.

Maybe she just didn‚Äôt want me there.

Once they left, I had my sister text me a picture of the menu.

I spent the remainder of my alone time googling and memorizing how many calories were in each item so I would know exactly which leftovers to eat, and how much, without raising suspicion.

But I shouldn‚Äôt have bothered.

When my family got back, the only person who even looked at me was my mom as she gracelessly dropped a bag on the table and said, ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù and put my headphones back on.

Then I started counting out grains of rice.

I think I was on #36 when I looked up from my plate.

Right there in front of me, my dad was collapsed on the floor, and my mom was screaming at a 911 operator through the phone.

Let me just say: Bose makes some quality soundproof headphones.

To this day, I still have no idea what happened.

I watched as my dad forced himself to his feet and stumbled towards the balcony for some fresh air.

I couldn‚Äôt believe I had been worried about something as stupid as grains of rice.

My mom looked at me and said, ‚ÄúGo help him.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to ask: *How?*

But she was already out the door. Something about going to let the paramedics in.

And just like that, my dad and I were alone.

He‚Äôs always saying we should spend more time together.

Guess he got what he asked for.

My dad was half-standing, half-collapsed against the balcony railing. Dripping sweat into the frigid winter night, he heaved deep breaths that rattled in and out.

I hovered in the doorway, afraid to breathe at all.

He refused to look at me, choosing instead to stare out into the darkness. I tried not to shiver from the cold as I stood with him in silence.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if my mind was racing or frozen.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I just said: ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

He turned to face me.

I‚Äôve never seen such disgust in someone‚Äôs eyes.

If that was even what was there at all - I only got to see for a fraction of a second before his gaze shifted past me to the front door.

My mom came bursting through it with a paramedic, who was shouting into a radio. The blocky, outdated thing produced so much static you could barely hear the voice shouting back through the other side.

Staring straight ahead, my dad shoved me as hard as he could and staggered past me to the paramedic, where he collapsed into her arms.

My spine connected with the corner of the table as his shove threw me off balance, and it was my turn to collapse as searing pain ripped through my body.

Unlike my dad, though, no one was there to catch me.

I fell to the floor.

From there, I was helpless to watch as my parents left with the paramedic.

I wondered if this was the last time I‚Äôd ever see my dad.

On their way out my mom turned back to look at me.

She said: ‚ÄúThe kids are in the other room. Make sure they‚Äôre asleep by the time we get back.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúWhat should I tell them?‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an idiot.‚Äù

Then the door clicked shut behind them."

i had an okay mother's day weekend. on mother's day i didn't work so i just stayed home. i was supposed to to do the breast cancer walk but that never happened. next year i guess.

right now im feeling some kind of way because today i got yelled at by a customer because he needed help with paying with two separate cards. one was food stamps card and the other debit.  i took $4 off the food stamp card and the guy.paid the rest with debit and got $25 cash back. after everything was done, he got mad and bitched that i left him with $.47 on his food stamp card and that he cant do shit with it. well sorry! i thought you wanted to take the remaining amount on the damn card. if you want your money back go to customer service not the fucking cashier. douchebag mother fucker.

I am also beginning to see how deceptive people can be. i had a customer that tried to give me a fake $100 and his excuse was that it got wet in his pocket. then he gave me a real $10 to pay for his stuff. yeah you are not slick asshole. people really aint shit smh...

I have something else to get off my chest. Whenever someone has a problem they always take it out on me. you know i dont appreciate that and sooner or later ill get strong enough to act an ass and be sassy as hell about it. this is going for customers and my coworkers."

I had a day off yesterday.I joined a meeting with a kinder-garden teacher which will be my younger kids'.

Discuss about the education of Waldorf with her.

Also we try to find a flat that we will move to around the weekend,but it's not easy to find it.

I also picked up my kids to go to school by motorbike yesterday that he requested me before.

He was exciting about it,because he told me he never went to school by took a motorbike. So I did it.

But I was sad that he told me he was beaten by his classmate.

It happened few times he told me.Sometimes he fight with the boy,but he felt bad about fighting.

I told him when he was beaten then he need to fight to protect himself.

I don't know if I were correct or not.I hope he can become brave.My older boy was a kind person,he always request me to gave him money to support beggar,maybe because I always told him to help others.

Although he seems timid,but I thought he need times to develop his mindset.

My wife told me he is very powerful in fact,but I am not scenes.„ÄÄ

My wife is a housekeeper.She take care the kids all the day. I hope she was right.

My kids was just too kind to fight.

I am having a great day.

Just great.

Every weekend I feel like shit because I think F hates me, but then he somehow makes my day amazing.

All of the seniors were gonna so it was just us Juniors. We hand painted T-shirt screens. I started to make one but it looked crappy so I made one of a brayer. It‚Äôs a little plain but it‚Äôll be cool.

F suggested I add something to it but I didn‚Äôt end up doing it. I really like our class. It‚Äôs a good group. None of them are very serious about art besides Lilah and River, but they‚Äôre all good people.

When everyone left I was drying my screen still and F commented on how good I always am at cleaning up. Some people left out paintbrushes from the screen painting.

F started talking about how we might do things different in class next year. He said he wanted to make projects looser. He said he wants to do research differently or not at all. I agreed. I don‚Äôt think he understands why we don‚Äôt like/find the research helpful.

I said we should do more critiques so we could at least get more comfortable with them. He agreed.

River brought these awesome sugar cookies and we all had a few. They were amazing. After I had one I asked if I could have a second. And F was like I‚Äôm glad you asked because I was gonna get another too. He‚Äôs so funny.

After a while he mentioned doing a trip. Kind of like how band/choir/orchestra/even Spanish does a trip to some where.  I got so excited. I kept telling him what a good idea and how fun that would be. He seemed really excited about the idea and really seemed like he wanted to make it happen.

We talked about LA, or going to Art Basel in Miami, or Chicago, even Italy. Athena brought up the cost factor, but I said that if we wanted to go we could all figure out a way to come up with the money. I know I‚Äôd save for it.

Art Basel sounded like a whole lot of fun. I am so  fuckin excited. I never dreamed of doing something like this. F seems to really like traveling. I kept telling him how fun going on a trip would be.

He said the only issue is that unless it‚Äôs a trip FOR the school. It can‚Äôt be associated with the school in any way. He couldn‚Äôt make students go, he couldn‚Äôt even organize it at school. He can‚Äôt even use his school email for anything related to it either. Just a liability thing.

How fun would it be to go on a trip with F and the crew. Omg I‚Äôm just dying thinking of how fun it would be. It‚Äôd be a dream come true. A literal dream come true.

He seems so adamant about making it happen.

God, this year is gonna be amazing.

Camp at my dream college over the summer.
Being a senior.
Finishing my portfolio and applying to dream college.
Having a whole ‚Äònother year with F and the gang.
A TRIP FOR AP/IB ART?!!!!!

Anyways..
He didn‚Äôt have to pick up his son early today, so we stayed a few minutes later. When we were cleaning up to leave, I was carrying the closed jars of screen filler and drawing fluid and I dropped the bottle of drawing fluid and it spilled al over the floor. There was so much.

I‚Äôm thankful I wasn‚Äôt on my period and super hormonal or I would have burst out crying. I just kept saying I was sorry and we tried scraping it up to clean it. F went down to get a mop.

We eventually cleaned it all up but I felt really bad. It was quite the mess. He didn‚Äôt seem mad at all but I felt pretty shitty. I still do.



Anyways I‚Äôm gonna eat dinner now, but I‚Äôm SO EXCITED AHHHHHHHHHHHH.

I fucking love F and the whole art department."
0,"13.05.19. Mother‚Äôs Day
It was Mother‚Äôs Day yesterday.

My way of coping was by refusing to acknowledge it.

Weirdly, though, it happened anyways.

So here‚Äôs how mine went.

I sent my mom a GIF of a mother twerking to a caption saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù until she accidentally booty bumps her kid across the room.

My mom loved it.

She showed it to all her friends.

She even texted me about it again this morning.

Apparently, their kids forgot to text.

So my mom wins.

She‚Äôs the best mom. She was so thrilled. It‚Äôs the proof of my love that she wanted - better, because it‚Äôs a portable copy.

As for me? I spent Mother‚Äôs Day taking care of the kids.

I woke up to a phone call from my sister crying in the bathroom. She forgot to take her pill and then had unprotected sex and let him finish inside her.

Fucking teenagers.

(Literally. Lol!)

I asked all the right questions and guided her to the right resources (read: I have a middle school sex education and let Planned Parenthood deal with her).

When I had done everything I could (which was mostly tell her to call Planned Parenthood), I hung up.

But two minutes later she sent me a text:

*planned parenthood is closed*

So I did some googling and within 30 seconds discovered she was fine as long as she took both pills the next day. She didn‚Äôt even need to call them.

So I texted her back:

*dw, you‚Äôre fine. I googled it*

She said:

*ok*
*thank you*

But I knew what she was thinking.

I knew she could have easily googled it herself. In fact, she probably did before she called me. After all, she‚Äôd already taken the second pill.

That wasn‚Äôt why she texted me.

She texted me because she needed comfort.

She needed someone who was calm and unshakeable and was going to help her without a second thought even though she made a mistake.

She needed someone who would tell her that she fucked up, but not that she *was* a fuckup.

She texted me because she needed someone who would love her no matter what.

No matter how many mistakes she makes. No matter how little she calls me unless she needs something. No matter how whiny or bitchy or needy she is.

She texted me because she knows I‚Äôll always be there.

And because she was anxious, and she wanted to feel better, and she didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

She texted me because she wanted her mom.

So I texted her:

*this happens, you‚Äôre ok :)*

*call me back if you need to*

And she replied:

*i love you*

Later in the day I got a facetime from the seven year old. I picked up the phone and before the screen could even show her face she screamed:

‚ÄúPULL DOWN YOUR SHIRT,‚Äù

Every time she sees me, the first thing she does is check to see if I‚Äôm still wearing the locket she gave me.

I always am.

So I pulled down my shirt so she could see it and opened it up and pulled out the note she put in there that says *I love you* in her little kid handwriting.

And she nodded in approval and said, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

Then she jumped right into what she wanted to tell me.

She‚Äôs all business, that one.

My mom spends every Mother‚Äôs Day looking for proof that we love her. So we buy her coffee and make her cards and go out to dinner, and she‚Äôs happy.

No one does that stuff for me.

They don‚Äôt need to.

I get my proof every day.

Because I‚Äôm around to see it.

Even on Mother‚Äôs Day, even when I‚Äôm far away, the moms will be celebrating all that they do for the family, while I take care of their kids.

My mom asks if we love her all the time.

If someone really loves you, you‚Äôll never need to ask.

They‚Äôll let you know.

You just have to be there to hear it."

Mother‚Äôs Day.

I barely even cried. Just teared up once or twice in the morning.

I thought I‚Äôd cry more. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so numb today.

Last time I saw mom was Mother‚Äôs Day last year. It‚Äôs almost been a year without her.

I wore the watch I gave to her last year. The matching watch I bought for her and her mom. I wonder if Grammy wore it today.

Probably not.

But I wore it today. I‚Äôm not a mom. But I‚Äôm the only living thing who is proof of her motherhood.

Well there‚Äôs my sister. I wonder if she ever cries for mom. She‚Äôs been brainwashed by my dad for too many years. I don‚Äôt doubt she at least thought of her today.

But does she cry?

It‚Äôs been a year. I mourned and mourned, came to terms, mourned and mourned more. Came to terms, mourned and mourned again. And it just repeats and repeats.

I was just out of the mourning cycle today.

I fucking miss her so much. It‚Äôs not fair. I want her back. I want a chance to say goodbye. I want a chance to hug her. At least give me that.

I had no fucking warning. I pay the price for ignorance.

I don‚Äôt know what to say besides I miss her. I wonder if she‚Äôs okay.

My religion tells me she‚Äôs burning in hell. My heart knows it‚Äôs true. I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been so against my faith this last year even more so than the previous year.

Even if I were still saved. And I died tonight. Went to heaven. How could I be happy knowing my mother is burning in eternal anguish and punishment.

Part of me wants to believe she‚Äôs in heaven. She believed. I know she did.

But believing isn‚Äôt enough. Even the demons believe.

But I can‚Äôt bear to think about all of this. I feel guilty and alone and mad at God.

I‚Äôm mad at him for not giving me a chance to say goodbye. I didn‚Äôt get no fucking hand holding in some hospital bed.

She died in her sleep. Alone. In her shitty apartment. All by herself. Totally and completely alone. Except for the company of Louie. No hug goodbye. No I love you. NO WARNING. She was sick but she was still working. I thought it was just pneumonia. Maybe it was. I don‚Äôt even know. I don‚Äôt even know what the death certificate says her cause of death was.

I need to know.

I don‚Äôt remember the last time I told her I loved her.

I don‚Äôt know if I ever did.

And I‚Äôm mad. For so many reasons.

All this grief has been bottled up for an entire year, and I‚Äôm not much better. Turned into me fucking cutting myself because I felt like shit because I missed her so much. Then I cut because I hated myself. Now I cut because I‚Äôm addicted.

I miss you mom. I hope you can hear me. I wish you could. I hope you don‚Äôt see me like this.

There‚Äôs so much I want to say to you. But most of it isn‚Äôt even able to be expressed with words.

I wish you could feel my tears. Because so many of them are for you.

Fuck Mother‚Äôs Day.

I want my mom back."

I have a lot of trouble paying attention.

Right now, I‚Äôm trying to do my calculus homework. I‚Äôm already behind, since I joined the course late and then didn‚Äôt do any work.

But I got 100% on both the quizzes without studying, so the little motivation I started with got shot to hell.

I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrying‚Äù to do it (unsuccessfully) all day.

Instead of my homework, though, I goofed off and hung out with friends and watched TV.

Avoided my desk.

Found every excuse I could to put it off longer.

I did everything I usually do.

Until the cravings hit.

Doing nothing endlessly often leads to cravings, because it gives me time to think.

So I decided to channel all that focus; that need to do *something* - drink, drugs, cut, cry - into my homework.

I usually swap one coping mechanism for another.

Why not trade cutting for calculus?

Drugs for derivatives?

Panic attacks for... well, still panic attacks. But at least the math-related ones are more productive.

It worked for about five minutes.

The problem is, my homework is SO boring.

Well, the homework isn‚Äôt boring. Practise problems are fine for me to focus on once I understand the material.

The problem is, I don‚Äôt understand the material.

Because to understand the material, you have to watch the lecture videos.

And the lecture videos are *SO* boring.

I simply can‚Äôt watch them.

So I skip right to the practise problems instead.

But I don‚Äôt know how to do them, because I didn‚Äôt watch the lecture videos.

See the problem?

Instead I‚Äôm watching a different, more interesting, faster paced online video, taking notes, desperately hoping this will teach me what I need to know.

But I don‚Äôt even know if this is what I need to know. It‚Äôs all in the lecture videos. If I just watched them, I would know if this is what I need to know or not.

But I can‚Äôt watch them.

I try.

But it doesn‚Äôt even matter. I just space out and then suddenly they‚Äôre over.

And honestly, I can‚Äôt even focus on the other fucking video either. I keep rewinding it because I spaced out.

I‚Äôm so fucking sick of trying and it not even mattering.

But what else can I do?

The answer is nothing.

I just have to try again.

No point complaining about it.

It‚Äôs my own fucking fault for being so distracted.

I might not even have ADHD. The stupid testing lady thinks I just have PTSD and a bad attitude.

Well, she didn‚Äôt say that exactly.

But I can tell.

And she wasn‚Äôt stupid. She was nice.

I just really wish I could focus.

Today, me and my housemate went to a friend‚Äôs house to do some school stuff together.

We did a little bit of work.

...But mostly, we binge watched TV.

We got snacks and opened the door and windows to let in as much light and sunshine as we could, and then we spent most of the day enjoying the show and each other‚Äôs company.

We couldn‚Äôt help ourselves - it was too gorgeous a day to waste being stressed and miserable.

Plus, it‚Äôs a Saturday. And summer!

Around 3pm I made myself call it quits so I could go home and do something productive while there was still some daytime left.

My friend had to go to campus, so we all walked back together laughing and chatting.

I spent the rest of the day unpacking my room. Everything is finally organized and put away. It‚Äôs so nice to finally be settled.

Now it really feels like I‚Äôm home.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, today had lots of stress and things to worry about. My life is far from perfect.

I actually had to push back going to my friends house to an hour later because I was too busy curled up crying on my bedroom floor.

But that stuff is just a part of my life now. Honestly, I‚Äôm just relieved I only wasted an hour feeling that bad today before I managed to snap myself out of it.

Overall, today was the most average day I‚Äôve had in a long time.

I even texted my friend about a guy she‚Äôs going out with. It was the most mundane, exciting conversation I‚Äôve had in ages. It‚Äôs such a normal thing to talk about.

There were no crazy highs or lows today. No huge emotional breakthroughs.

Nothing happened today that I‚Äôm gonna remember forever.

It was just an average day.

I was just an average teenager (young adult?), hanging out with friends and doing homework and goofing off and cleaning my room.

God, it felt good.

My life has been a lot of things, but average isn‚Äôt one of them.

I‚Äôm so sick of feeling like an imposter in my own life.

Of having experiences so crazy I can‚Äôt even talk about them because people think I‚Äôm making them up.

Of not having anyone to relate to when I feel alone.

Of wondering if I would ever really get better and be able to have a normal life.

Today, though, I did it.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll stick. If I know one thing about myself it‚Äôs that I tend to change pretty fast. I know better than to bother getting used to anything.

But I had a perfectly normal day today.

I had my bad moments. But who doesn‚Äôt?

That‚Äôs normal too. Even if the things I was stressed about maybe aren‚Äôt.

Something I‚Äôm learning is that pain is universal.

Everyone has stuff they‚Äôre stressed about. I‚Äôm not any different from anybody else for being anxious. And they‚Äôre not any different from me, either.

By the end of the day, when I ate dinner with my other housemate, I was worn out.

But it wasn‚Äôt my usual unbearable fatigue from sadness and stress and being overwhelmed.

I was just tired because I had a full day.

Now I‚Äôm curled up in bed.

My room is clean and all my stuff in the right place.

I don‚Äôt have any overdue tasks I procrastinated. (I think. I hope!)

I know exactly what I have to do tomorrow.

I have something to do tomorrow!

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a sense of purpose. Or anything even remotely resembling a routine. It feels really, really good.

Nothing super crazy is happening. I can actually relax for a minute. Try to slow down and enjoy myself.

For the first time, today felt like just another day. I can picture this all happening again tomorrow. And I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

It‚Äôs really soothing to be able to know what tomorrow will look like. Usually, it‚Äôs so hard for me to predict. But everything is starting to balance out.

Today feels perfectly normal. Like it could happen again tomorrow. Today was repeatable, which is the best thing a day can be.

It‚Äôs perfect.

No - it‚Äôs better than perfect.

It‚Äôs average."

I think I should clarify.

I‚Äôm not totally obsessed with F all day long. It‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm at home.

I don‚Äôt know why exactly. Well‚Äî I do, kinda. When I get to school I just kind of forget. People loosen me up. Talking really helps get out my anxiety.

And even when I‚Äôm in class some days, I could care less what he does/ says.

Not often though, but it does happen.

But its when I have to leave his presence for the day I just die a little. The times I do leave happy and perfectly content is when I know for a fact I will talk to him again soon.

I miss him.

I talked with Andy today about the whole F vs A thing. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. If I get the chance Monday I really want to talk to him about it.

I have so much art to make this week. Shit.

Three independent projects PLUS my power project.

I don‚Äôt really have anything to say today, I just didn‚Äôt want to skip a day.

Today was pretty average. Had its ups and downs.

I can‚Äôt help wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm annoying. He certainly doesn‚Äôt give off that vibe at all, but I wonder if he‚Äôs ever just like, Damn. I wish S wasn‚Äôt hanging around here after school again.

The last thing on the planet I want to be is annoying to F.

Yesterday went weirdly. I don‚Äôt remember quite what we said/did but I remember getting home and just wanting to cut so bad because of how stupid I was around him. I couldn‚Äôt find my blade anywhere.

I glued realistic eyes to the mannequin and posted it on my story during school. After I‚Äôd been home for a bit, he replied ‚ÄúüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÄüëÅüëÄüëÅ‚Äù which made me so happy I started crying on my bed.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I just really needed that. A lot. I no longer had the urge to cut. But I couldn‚Äôt find my knife anywhere so it didn‚Äôt matter anyways. Later that night I got desperate again and found an old blade in the toolbox downstairs. It was mine but I‚Äôd lost it a long time ago.

I didn‚Äôt make any new cuts really, just opened some scabs.

Which I really want to do right now.

But I want to write about my day. Not yesterday. Ugh. I can do all the scab picking I want tonight.

Today was a weird schedule. I almost ran into him in the hallway during lunch when going around the corner and he gave me one of the friendliest ‚Äúhey S‚Äî‚Äî‚Äòs‚Äù I‚Äôve ever heard. It just made me melt inside I felt so happy.

In 6th hour it was just me, L, K, J, and F. We talked and talked and jokes about things for almost the whole hour, and into 7th hour. We had a shortened schedule for yearbooks today.

During 7th hour we decided to try power washing the screens. And we did. I worked on it for a long time. Then took a break to get my yearbook at 1. Some complications happened and I couldn‚Äôt get it today.

Then I went back outside and cleaned some more. F joined me later for a while. Then we cleaned it up and took it back inside.

I love talking with him so much. So fucking much.

We were talking before I left and said something about what you call college professors, some go by their name some go by last name etc.

That got him talking about his own name. He says he doesn‚Äôt mind that people call him F. But he just thinks it‚Äôs weird because it‚Äôs not HIS name. He says he doesn‚Äôt care that much. But I could really tell he‚Äôd rather be called A.

I can‚Äôt imagine calling him A. No one else does it so it would be weird. I jokingly went OK, A‚Äî-. And it was SO weird calling him A.

I‚Äôd been wondering about this for a while now when I overheard him say something similar to someone.

I don‚Äôt really know how to go forward. F? A? Mr. F? I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd care if I called him A. He‚Äôd actually prefer it from his students instead of F.

I‚Äôm just so conflicted. I want to please him, but it would sound weird especially to my peers to call him A.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. If for some reason I have the chance Monday, I figure I‚Äôll be sneaky and be like, ‚ÄúHey, F‚ÄîA‚ÄîMr. F whatever, sorry, (insert question)‚Äù

Hopefully he will clarify things. Maybe.

I like calling him F. I think it works. But I understand where he‚Äôs coming from.

A.

A. F.

F?

Fuck.

Alex always calls him A. I thought it was weird but I always wished I had her confidence.

A.

A new start?

I don‚Äôt like it. But I love it.

A.

I don‚Äôt wanna go to work. I just want to sit here and complain. I hate weekends. I can‚Äôt talk to him for two full days. Two long days.

I won‚Äôt be able to talk to him all summer. Shit.

I just hope the last time I see him isn‚Äôt weird. I hope he‚Äôs not like, bye. And then gets distracted by something else. I‚Äôm gonna miss him so much. The seniors are gone now.

But I‚Äôm gonna miss him more than any of them combined.

I like do that.

I can discuss with him about any topic.

He is studying elementary school first year.

Not know too much word.

I told him when he learn a word,he should mark sure the step of writing the word.

He say ""We use rainbow color to show each step""

So I ask him,if the writing step word is more than 7.How about it?

He say repeat that again.

I say oh! I forgot it.

He likes to ask me the word that he don't know.

Chinese word sometimes like a draw.

Many words you can explain the meaning by separate it.

So I can show him why the word combine from others and the meaning of it.

Welcome back to our regularly scheduled programming.

We‚Äôre sorry for the interruption of happiness you‚Äôve been experiencing for the past few days.

We‚Äôre not sure where it came from, but we have our best working to solve the problem.

We guarantee it won‚Äôt happen again.

I started feeling like shit again out of nowhere sometime yesterday afternoon.

It didn‚Äôt even make sense.

I was having fun right up until I had a panic attack.

This shit‚Äôs so fucking frustrating.

I still had good moments. In a way that‚Äôs actually worse, because I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy them as much as I wanted to.

But at least they happened.

In the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm pretty lucky. Not everyone gets good moments.

I got to see a friend of mine I haven‚Äôt seen in a while. Catching up with her is always a great time.

Hung out with my housemates, which is always awesome.

One of them even taught me how to fly a drone!

I‚Äôve been so excited to do that with him for days.

But then when we actually did it, even though it went really well and I had a great time, I couldn‚Äôt get as excited as I wanted to feel.

Everything just feels sort of separated.

Like there‚Äôs a mostly transparent wall in between me and the world. But it tints everything grey.

The depression is back - and so is the anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, and whatever the fuck else is wrong with me. Even my physical health problems are acting up.

It‚Äôs really a party now.

Everyone was invited, and they all came. And they brought their friends!

Honestly, the worst part of having all this shit is how hard it is to figure out which one is causing my problems at any given moment.

It could be something as simple as the weather.

It‚Äôs greyer and rainier than it was yesterday. I‚Äôm still a person; not everything is related to mental illness or one of my many ongoing crises.

Who knows?

Maybe nothing‚Äôs wrong.

Maybe I just miss the sunshine."

So the only hope of mine for them is grow up with healthy.Nothing else.

Every year my birthday I make a wish about safety and healthy to my family.

Today was a good day. We had the potluck.

I finished my book.

Talked with L.

Had a whole conversation with L and F about the future of the art show. Even the future of art classes at our school.

F posted a pic of my photographs to the insta.

When I asked when we would sit down and talk art club for next year, he said we could just think of idea during the summer and text. Something along those lines.

That made me smile. He doesn‚Äôt just want to ditch us over summer.

It really proves he cares.

Most every day I go through this cycle. I wake up, excited to go to school. To see F. To have the chance to talk to him, for him to smile at me. Anything.

I sit in the cafeteria and realize he‚Äôs too busy to care. To notice me.

I forget and move on with my day. Mildly depressed but okay overall.

I get to class and he‚Äôs either bland or in a great mood. Most days he‚Äôll ask me something or say something to me in class if I don‚Äôt.

I guess I just strive for those conversations. The ones we‚Äôve had after school. Or during class sometimes. I feel like I fit in some place when I talk to him. Like I belong, and am accepted.

I don‚Äôt know when or if I‚Äôll ever be satisfied.

I just wish I could understand his thinking. Get inside his head. See the world through his eyes.

I‚Äôm less sad about summer now, and I‚Äôm looking forward to next year and all the possibilities and conversations and adventures it brings. I‚Äôm beyond thankful I‚Äôm a junior. Ending things now like this would hurt me too much.

I just want to feel normal. I wish I weren‚Äôt so fucking obsessive over him. I sound like a lunatic. A sappy teenage girl obsessed with her mentor.

God I even dress like him sometimes. Even M thinks so. I could quote her.

‚ÄúYou dress like F but with glitter and jewelry.‚Äù

Thanks. Glad to know I dress like a middle class 40 something white dad. She‚Äôs not wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it hurts.

I need a fuckin reason to stay after tomorrow. Like ASAP. But I don‚Äôt really have any. Maybe I should just go home for once.

Go home and draw. Spend some of that F energy working on my projects. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll start a drawing tomorrow. I‚Äôll come in during seminar it‚Äôll be fine.

I have to leave for the orthodontist at 12:10. Hopefully I‚Äôll get back before or right after 6th hour starts.

Fuck I wish I had money.

I have a spending problem.

I don‚Äôt NEED a new sketchbook. I don‚Äôt NEED Dr. Martens. I don‚Äôt NEED all this shit. I wish I could reduce myself to nothing. If it means dressing like a white dad, so be it.

0,"08.05.19. That feeling
You know that feeling when something hits you so strongly you can‚Äôt even react to it?

I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called.

Not that it matters. I don‚Äôt think this feeling needs a name.

I woke up really early today.

Like, 4am early.

The first thing I did was enroll in a math course. Seeing the registration confirmed soothed something in me I didn‚Äôt even realize was there.

I think it‚Äôs just nice to have something to do.

One of my housemates is taking the same course. We‚Äôre going to the library later.

For better or worse, we‚Äôre in it together now.

By 5am, I was dressed and ready for the day. But it wasn‚Äôt ready for me yet - it was still dark out.

I went for a run around the neighbourhood until the sun came up.

I haven‚Äôt run in a very long time. It felt really good to feel the cool morning air in my burning lungs. My heart was beating in a good way.

It was still so early when I got back, I had time to take a nap so I could wake up with the rest of the world.

I crawled back in bed... well, ‚Äúbed‚Äù is a bit of an exaggeration. Right now all I have is an old mattress topper on the floor. My bed hasn‚Äôt arrived yet.

I lay on the floor, snuggled up under a cozy blanket and piles of trash I still have to properly unpack.

And I had the best sleep I‚Äôve had in ages.

By 6:15am I was tired of sleeping, so I got up again and decided to make breakfast.

Eating breakfast is another thing I haven‚Äôt done in a really long time. I made eggs.

While I cooked, I chatted idly with the guy who‚Äôs been crashing in our basement.

The smell of food always draws people out.

He commented on how I was doing the dishes by hand even though we had a dishwasher. I forgot we have a dishwasher now.

But I still did the dishes in the sink. I told him, ‚ÄúI want this clean NOW. And I don‚Äôt mind doing it by hand.‚Äù

He chuckled and said my other housemate said the same thing last night.

I guess we‚Äôre all still getting used to the new place and unlearning our old habits. But there‚Äôs a certain comfort in knowing all our instincts are in sync.

At 7am I found myself at the supermarket getting the groceries we forgot to get yesterday.

I stopped for coffee on the way there, and drank it as I walked in the sunshine. By the time I was finished drinking I was home again.

The kitchen was quiet, so I stayed.

After a few minutes, one of my housemates came down to make himself breakfast before work.

We‚Äôre already used to each other‚Äôs habits, so after a quick ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù neither of us felt the need for conversation.

There‚Äôs nothing better than quiet company.

Living here is so new, yet it feels so familiar.

What is that feeling? Does it have a name?

Does it even need one?

Now it‚Äôs only 8:30 in the morning. My other two housemates haven‚Äôt even woken up yet, and I‚Äôve already enjoyed an entire day.

And I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of it."

Hi Diary, it's been a long time since I have written anything. I am fine nowadays. Everything in my life is going well. I have been working in a software company and I love my job. I have great friends and everything feels nice.

A few months ago my college had finished and I thought that most of the friends would be apart from my life. I thought I have no use to be in there life. I thought lowly of me. But, even after 6 months passed almost all of my friends are with me. I have never been this happy in my life. Everything seems so perfect. I love myself too. After all, I am in love. Yes, I am in love.

I never thought I would love someone. I would fall for someone. I deserved someone. I have always tried to keep my choices aside and thought of what had to be done, not that what I want to do. Now that I have my life in a pretty stable condition, not on career or studies. But, my mind is stable. I want to tell you that no matter how messed up your life gets, if you are surrounded by good people, everything seems to be alright. I am so grateful to have my friends and family. I always wanted to be happy and now I feel like I have reached my goal. Now, I just have to stay here for the rest of my life. \^\^"

i been holding my feelings in due to pure laziness which damaged me even more. at my job ever since we had the self scan  installed, the supervisors been all over me for not watching when the light blinks when the customers need help or taking too long to help a customer. two nights ago my supervisor screamed at me because she said i overpowered her and that hurted because she never yelled at me like that or talked to me the way she did. the next day i was off and spent the day doing my schoolwork while being disconnected from social media. working so many days and hours made me resent everyone at my job. the minute i walk in the place im tired and ready to go.  My job takes all the energy from me. once i get home i never do anything fun except sleep. my bed is the number one spot for me.

I will be working at the swimming pool again this year so now i have juggle between my shitty retail job and school and now the swimming pool place. this summer will be a nightmare for me. I am already dreading it now.

i installed grindr and as usual no one responded. i could go for a cuddling session with a guy and no one wants to do it.  I hate myself.

i have to muster up the strength to write my budget down. I am sick of overspending so i want to set a budget for shit. i never done this so wish me luck.

i have a coding app that i also want to check out when i am reloaded with energy. Coding would be a good side hustle for me.

i gotta clean my room. it smells. what the fuck??

I am mentally sore from all the bitching by my coworker. i forgot to mention another coworker snapped when someone took her newspaper. totally unprofessional.

i need to get strong and be an asshole because people love to shit on me. when i bring the asshole side out they will not wanna be around me. hell ill have to start being extra sassy. i dont need to respect authority when they are ungrateful.

I left my family today and went back to school.

I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to anyone.

Not even the kids.

I just left.

My dad made someone who works for him drive me back and help me move in. No one told me that was the plan; I had a train booked.

I found out when a stranger showed up with an old blue pickup truck at 9am and told me to get in.

Driving for 3 hours with a total stranger and all of your belongings is weird, to say the least.

Weirder when your dad is his boss.

But it ended up being pretty fun. He was a nice guy. Even told me the name he picked for his baby, who‚Äôs due this June. (Or was it July?)

He said he knew he could trust me to keep it secret.

Said the same thing right before he started telling me what it‚Äôs like to work for my dad.

He was right both times.

I can keep a secret.

After I moved in and he left, I got really stressed out.

I couldn‚Äôt connect with my housemates, who had already been living in the new place before I arrived. I felt like an alien posing as their friend.

I felt so out of place.

Being in a brand new house with no plan and no schedule was really overwhelming.

There were a lot of details to work out. I wanted to blow it all off and get high.

But I didn‚Äôt.

I couldn‚Äôt - I got rid of all my drugs, and even my pipe.

Instead, I wrote a list of things I needed to do. I made an action plan. I realized it wasn‚Äôt as overwhelming or impossible as I thought. And I felt better.

Then the rest of my housemates got home.

I‚Äôm so grateful for them.

We spent all night together, just hanging out and catching up and getting drunk.

Writing it out, it sounds so basic and unmemorable.

We got groceries.

Made dinner (tacos!!).

Did vodka shots and chugged cheap wine.

Put on throwbacks and danced around the kitchen.

Chatted, caught up with each other.

Moved all the shit out of the basement. The tenants before us had some weird stuff down there.

I stopped feeling out of place pretty quickly.

We laughed so much.

We were so comfortable with each other.

We spent hours late into the night just enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

At one point, our new housemate said, ‚ÄúMy life is so much better now that I‚Äôm living with you guys.‚Äù

I responded, ‚ÄúWe feel the same way about you.‚Äù

And I thought: I‚Äôm home."

JESUS CHRIST ITS ALREADY THE 7TH!!

Time is FLYING by. So fucking fast. School gets out in 16ish days. Ahhhb Fuck FUCK.

I only have 12 days left in class. 12 days with my friends. One day left with my senior friends. 11 classes left with F...

Then I‚Äôll be away all summer. No goofs to cheer me up. Just me. Alone. I‚Äôll make friends at camp of course, and my sister will be around sure, but no F for months.

He‚Äôs like the light of my school life. He makes school worth coming to. Directly and indirectly. All I‚Äôve ever longed for is to be accepted and admired by people. Not everyone of course, but the people I admire. And there isn‚Äôt a person on earth I admire more than F. He‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôs got the perfect job. Perfect wife. Perfect kids. Perfect humor. Perfect aspirations. Perfect in his words. Perfect in everything. Perfectly UNperfect.

And he notices ME. He TRUSTS me. He knows one of my greatest secrets. He laughs at my jokes. He likes my art. (I hope.) He cares for his students. He‚Äôs created an amazing classroom/environment for us. He‚Äôs amazing. He‚Äôs just so perfect. I wish I were him. I wish I were able to become him.

And that‚Äôs why I dread summer. In a way. This man I‚Äôve obsessed over every single day for almost the entirety of my junior year will have no contact with me for three months. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll end up emailing him, or messaging him. Or he‚Äôll do the same. But it‚Äôs not the same. Not at all.

The only thing keeping me going is that I‚Äôll be able to post things on Instagram. Social media is the only thing keeping me held together over the summer.

Anyways.

I asked him about AP today. I asked if I could do my breadth and concentration over the summer in addition to my summer assignments. We talked and worked most of it out. He said that it was fine. I‚Äôm a unique case anyways. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of work, but I‚Äôd have to do it regardless. I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into that again. I‚Äôll just get stressed. I still need to finish my DBQ for US History.

The potluck is tomorrow! I‚Äôm so excited and sad. I‚Äôm sad to see all my senior friends leave. But I‚Äôm excited to spend quality time with them one last time. I‚Äôm thinking about writing some little letters and sticking some coupons to my work in a little envelope and give it to them. It might be kind of cheesy though. But they‚Äôre close and they won‚Äôt think that. (I hope.)

I made a layered banana pudding. It took me like two hours from the time I got off work to the time I finished. I made one for school and one for the house. It looks and tastes so good. I‚Äôm so proud. I sure hope F likes banana.

But today was ok. Better than I thought it‚Äôd go. I woke up with a pretty sore leg. It doesn‚Äôt hurt so bad now ‚Äî unless I smack it or something. I thought it was a lot of cuts when I did it. But not I‚Äôm not so sure. Only 60ish. Which is more than I usually do. But they don‚Äôt look bad. They‚Äôre just dark and solid. They don‚Äôt look bad yet, or still. Just some limbo state.

I can‚Äôt wait in two days for me to be able to cut the scabs all off and bleed again. It‚Äôs not that I want the pain. It‚Äôs not about that at all. It‚Äôs just about peeling scabs. I‚Äôve always loved doing that ever since I was small. I still do. But differently of course.

I really don‚Äôt want to do my DBQ but I should.
I‚Äôm gonna finish the questions tonight. Shower in the morning. Then write the essay before I get ready. I can‚Äôt afford to turn this in late. I‚Äôd fail the class.

Tomorrow is gonna be a good day. I‚Äôm going in with lower expectations but you never know.

I should probably just do the questions in the morning. That way it‚Äôll be fresh in my mind.

I‚Äôm going to lay in bed and examine my scabs.

Count them properly maybe. I don‚Äôt usually count. I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôll stop that here and now.

But I want to touch them.

And drift into sleep.

And hold my leg like my dying child.

The dying child no one knows who‚Äôs terminally ill because pants exist.

Only one person knows. (Two, but she doesn‚Äôt count) F know. But does he know? I hope he didn‚Äôt think that was a one time thing. But why wouldn‚Äôt he? My email said it was the last time I‚Äôd ever do it. That I‚Äôve quit. Why would I lie?

He trusts me. Doesn‚Äôt he?

I dream that I could show someone. Show him. Just for a few moments. Obviously it‚Äôd never be acceptable to do that. I‚Äôd never dream on doing it in real life.

But I can dream can‚Äôt I?

I‚Äôm so fucked in the head. I‚Äôm so creepy and obsessive. I hope to god no one I know ever finds these. This subreddit is growing more active every week. It used to be only be and one maybe two people.

If it gets too popular I guess I can delete my posts. I‚Äôll save them for sure. For myself.

So future me can read this. So future me can look back at her mistakes with a sad smile. Realizing how far she‚Äôs come.

Hey you. What‚Äôs up?"

Dear Diary, is everyone I know reading you? It seems like someone‚Äôs playing a prank on me. I write something in here and the next day someone tells me or does something that is just too fitting to what I wrote.

The other day I wrote about a crush and that same crush seems to look at me more or be careful around me. I wrote about how I admired someone and that person seemed to talk to me more the next day. I wrote about how I didn‚Äôt like someone and the next day they knew exactly how to push my buttons. Is it just some placebo effect that makes me paranoid or are the people in my life reading my entries and giggling to themselves about how pathetic I am?

today i called the ambulance for my mom again

its not uncommon or weird nor something to be feared.

She has severe COPD which makes it very difficult to do every day tasks it also doesn't help her that shes depressed. tonight was average but after she left my uncle stated that she would die i commented nonchalant not tonight. It wasn't until i thought back to the other times where she could have died that's when i became upset. all my life its been like this i am the one you have to fall onto because no one else is there, i am the one who has to call the ambulance because you cant pull yourself together. And yet you treat me like every one else.. like shit. You wonder why everyone in our family has left you its because your garbage. i feel like disowning you but your also all i have i hate you but i love you with all of my heart.
it's painful to see whats happening to your life.
from your perspective it must be so hard to continue to live when you lost everything im just glad you're strong."

Another day. It came crashing down bad for a bit. But only because I chose to do that.

I hate school.

I should clarify, I hate core classes. History, Science, Math, English. I can‚Äôt stand it.

The only reason I have for going to school is my art classes, and when they don‚Äôt go well, I feel like absolute shit.

I got caught up with my other book. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. I reread a lot but I‚Äôm almost glad I did. I would have read my other book but it looks too angsty and depressing.

Art went meh. I tried my copper etching using sharpie as a realist. The sharpie came off in a lot of areas when in the ferric chloride and left weird marks everywhere. The print didn‚Äôt turn out well. F said it was okay because it‚Äôs kind of a cool effect. Just not for what I‚Äôm trying to do. Later after an uneventful class, (HENRY CHOPPED OFF HIS HAIR BTW) I was talking to F about failures and stuff. He said to look at failures like something I‚Äôve learned. The whole Edison quote and everything. I told him J agreed with him completely, but that I was just frustrated because I don‚Äôt have enough time to fail. He couldn‚Äôt really argue with that.

Oh and he said he liked my shirt. Yayayay, I wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd notice, but sure enough he did! I knew he‚Äôd like it. Even when I bought it. It‚Äôs something he would totally wear if he wore button down shirts.

I wanna buy more noww

Ahhh.

My brain is a mess. I drove home with R after school. She lives so close it would be stupid to wait for my dad.

When I got home I told my dad about this stupid city tour we had to do for history.

It took us like 2 hours. It was interesting though.

I‚Äôm so tired rn. I don‚Äôt feel like writing for once.

I‚Äôm just gonna look at shirts I can‚Äôt afford right now

I need to cancel my Spotify subscription

shitt
update: I totally forgot to mention I cut up the shit out of my right thigh. It was bleeding a whole lot. I got home after R dropped me off and I just needed to punish myself for being so dumb around F. I wish I weren‚Äôt so emotional.

I haven‚Äôt cut this MUCH in a very very long time if ever. But I‚Äôm doing fine now.

I just feel super disappointed"

In the morning, the journey(over 1 hours) to my office in the bus I looked the e-book from r/FreeEBOOKS,I choose [The Time Machine](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35/35-0.txt).

I don't know how long I read it, then I slept. Although I like Sci-fi novel but it still make me slept.

Because I'm not enough to read it in English. I had a book about time traveler in Chinese. It's very appealing me.

The most good thing is we have a brain to think.

When I was a student, I don't know ""why I come to this word?"" A big question right?

At that moment I thought 30 years old is enough for me.

But now, after got kids I think I need to survival more to grow up them.And after got master degree,I wonder what will happen in the feature? Fly car? Go to space? Destroy cancer?

More technology make people convenient. But how about the pollution that we also made.

The food we eat was full of chemical material,even fish also has plastic particles.

Few weeks ago,I attend a speech about ""environmental protection"".

The speaker told us there are only 7 kinds of turtle in the sea. If we don't take action to protect them.The environment will more hard.

Think about this I don't know what kind of world that we will transfer to our next generation.

Everyday I check my kids face,they are naive and curiously.Ask me, hey daddy if the butterfly has tail how will it become?Hey Daddy if I feed a frog will he know me when he grow up? @@"
0,"06.05.19. Nightmares
Here are some of my nightmares.

(Just in case, TW: suicide and sexual assault)

...

The one I have most often starts off as a regular dream.

At first, I never even realize what‚Äôs coming.

It‚Äôs never exactly same, but usually I dream I‚Äôm having a normal day.

Until something goes wrong, like it always does. Then it just keeps getting worse. And worse.

And worse.

The saddest part is, nothing in the dream up to this point is made up. I just have each of my real life problems bubble to the surface, one by one.

Then, all my worst fears start to come true. Things I won‚Äôt bother describing here, because they‚Äôre the kinds of fears personal to me.

But if you want to get in my shoes, think of who you‚Äôd be if you had nothing.

Actually think about it as you read. Make my nightmare your own.

Think of everything you‚Äôd have to lose to make life no longer worth living.

Think of the horrors you‚Äôd have to face that would be so unimaginable that you couldn‚Äôt live with them.

Think of all the nightmares you can‚Äôt even imagine. Try to imagine them.

Think of what kinds of sins you wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with yourself for committing.

I promise I‚Äôve been thinking of mine, too.

Then think of yourself right now.

And imagine the descent from who you are right now to who you‚Äôd become as all those things happen.

A person - you - turned into an empty shell of who you once were, broken beyond repair.

Imagine the way it feels to lose everything. To experience something that goes beyond your threshold of bearing.

Imagine the people closest to you being tortured to death.

Imagine watching.

Imagine hearing their screams.

Imagine hearing them turn into silence.

Imagine doing nothing.

Imagine *choosing* to do nothing.

Imagine trying to live with yourself after that.

Imagine whatever you have to until you feel the kind of despair that would be impossible to recover from, if it were real.

In the dream, it‚Äôs all too real.

I run into the bathroom and pull out a gun.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure from where; I don‚Äôt even own a gun in real life. I also don‚Äôt know why I would keep it in the bathroom.

I put the gun in my mouth and stare at myself in the mirror.

Watch the terror and tear-stricken expression on my face turn to despair, then eventually nothing at all. I keep eye contact with my reflection the whole time.

Once my eyes glaze over completely, I pull the trigger.

Nothing happens.

The gun is loaded and working. I know because I check every time. Sometimes I‚Äôll even shoot the mirror. It always shatters with a bang.

But no matter how many times I try, nothing happens to me. It doesn‚Äôt even hurt. The bullets just pass right through.

I don‚Äôt know if the dream implies that I can‚Äôt die, or that I‚Äôm already dead and in hell.

Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

To me, those are the same.

...

I have another nightmare that starts with me on trial for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit.

The crime is never directly stated, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs awful. The worst crime anyone could possibly commit.

I‚Äôm found guilty.

I swear it wasn‚Äôt me, but no one‚Äôs listening.

My friends and family shun me in disgust.

They each come to visit once, for closure.

They come to stare me in the face and tell me how horrible I make them feel that they fell for my lies and thought I was worthy of even being called a human being, let alone their friend.

All I can do is say I‚Äôm sorry.

The media writes me off as a monster, so the whole world hates me.

My face is in the newspaper- I know because someone sends me a copy with my eyes crossed out and awful sayings etched across the top.

Eventually, I go to jail.

In prison, I‚Äôm kept in solitary confinement, in a tiny little cell filled with all the things I‚Äôm most afraid of.

Each day, they come to torture me in all the worst ways. Show me what I deserve for what I‚Äôve done. Show me no mercy.

I scream and cry and beg and plead for them to stop, to please just listen, that I swear it wasn‚Äôt me.

But it never matters. Everyone knows I‚Äôm pure evil; the kind of person who would say anything to escape.

Wouldn‚Äôt anyone, in that situation?

Not that it matters.

Nothing stops it.

Eventually, I give up trying.

They always say pain gets better once you accept it. But that‚Äôs a lie.

The pain gets worse once I stop fighting it. Once I know it will never end, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.

Sometimes when I wake up, I can still feel it.

...

I don‚Äôt often dream of being raped anymore.

But I used to, every night.

Those dreams never tell a coherent story the way my regular nightmares do.

Like the memories themselves, they rip through the rest of my dreams in violent, chaotic fragments.

They never last for more than a split second. I only get moments frozen in time.

They‚Äôre almost more like pictures than living, breathing dreams.

Pictures you can feel with every fibre of your being.

They say in dreams you can never see hands. I don‚Äôt know who says that. It‚Äôs a lie.

Their hands are always the clearest part.

They‚Äôre wrapped around my waist to pick me up.

I‚Äôm too little to stop him. Not that I would have - I was too young to even think about it.

I can feel his fingers dig into my sides as he sets me down gently, onto him. I can feel him go into me.

But I can‚Äôt even focus on that, because I‚Äôm laughing too hard.

He‚Äôs tickling me with the fingers that are still gripping my sides.

I can‚Äôt catch my breath enough to tell him to stop. But why would he? I‚Äôm grinning and giggling, having a ball.

How can you laugh while being raped? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

Then suddenly I‚Äôm pinned against the bed, a different boy‚Äôs hands pressed into my back.

His whole weight is on me.

I can‚Äôt breathe.

In the dream I can‚Äôt feel him inside me at all.

I only know we‚Äôre having sex because of how the bed is shaking.

I‚Äôm gripping the sheets. They‚Äôre blue plaid. Cotton. Smell freshly washed.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder what detergent he uses.

The sheets are pressed right up against my face. That doesn‚Äôt help with the whole not being able to breathe thing.

I‚Äôm gasping for air.

But his weight is too much. I can‚Äôt even move enough to get words out. I couldn‚Äôt tell them to stop even if I tried.

Not that I tried.

All I can feel is his hands on my back. Pressing so hard they‚Äôre like knives piercing through my lungs.

Then everything goes black.

And suddenly I‚Äôm six years old again. Back on his lap.

This dream usually just keeps looping, fragment after fragment. There are more, but just writing this made me feel sick.

It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not like I need to write them down. I know exactly what happens.

It doesn‚Äôt end until something wakes me.

I rarely wake up on my own. Sometimes in movies a character sit up suddenly in their own bed, sweating and panting and glad that it‚Äôs over.

But not me.

I‚Äôm trapped in the nightmare.

...

I‚Äôm not excited to sleep tonight."
0,"The goofy loop and other things 04/01/9
I had a small, very small, tiny, wee drink last night and the birds are singing right now and I feel vile.

Drinking has been unfun for the most part this year. It was good up until July when the loopy painkiller fiasco began.

The other night I was talking to my friend about the goofy loop.

We were talking about the You show I'd been writing about last time and how everyone has a story of a guy like that.

I read once that magicians are able to pull off such elaborate tricks because people just don't think a magician would bother to go to all the trouble. They underestimate what other people are willing to do.

Like Dynamo walking on water when he's really walking on submerged plexiglass.

You just don't think someone would bother. That's how I feel about the stalker in that show.

In real life I assume nobody cares enough to do such convoluted things.

But in reality if some mentalist out there fancied those things it would be so easy to gain information about someone through their social media etc. Does Snapchat need a map? Really?

You best believe there's tape over my webcam.

Another wild thing is the Data Protection Act. Bear with me.

How many times have I collected a parcel from a store with my name and address on it, and wholeheartedly trusted the person behind the counter to do nothing bad with my details?

I forget bad intentions exist outside of Florida and the House of Lords.

Anyway the goofy loop.

In a traumatic situation, a person can shut down and get stuck in a cycle of a repetitive action. Their brain leaves the building.

Like when a police officer keeps shouting 'Put your hands up' or 'Put your weapon down'

Even though the person they're asking is clearly too norty and not listening.

Or when a group of men tried to pull Zibby Allen from Small Town Dicks into their car.

After they let her go she just sat on the floor, anticipating their return and doing nothing.

Didn't call the police. Or anybody at all.

Didn't get in her car and drive home. Or lock the doors at least.

Just sat there on the ground in the car park. Waiting.

How strange is that?

Anyway here I am hungover talking about assaults. I am putting myself back to bed. Goodbye."

Today is going quite well. I'm feeling okay which is a good thing. I had a tasty and filling lunch. I haven't eaten any sweets! This is a new one for me. I've been trying to end my toxic relationship with junk food and it's going surprisingly well.

I've been listening to music a lot today. I've also watched some YouTube videos and done a ton of work. Not everything went smooth but that is how things go usually.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have been thinking a lot about my mood swings. In my last entry I mentioned that I'm feeling hyperactive. Those episodes are quite frequent for me. My psychiatrist said I likely wasn't bipolar but it's still something we're investigating. I'm thinking that this might be actually true. I've been noticing more and more about myself. A diagnosis itself will not change anything for the better but I'll be able to start treatment. Or am I hypochondriac?

may, 06, 2019.

   i would usually use my finsta to post all my sad diary type of stuff but i deleted all my social media due to a mental health break and reddit is all i have. i was doing pretty okay for a while, almost a month of not being so sad. i've been feeling this way for almost as long as i can remember. my earliest memory of telling someone about me feeling this way was when i was about 10. i told my mom that i was depressed and she responded with ""you're too young to be feeling depressed, you can't be. you should'nt have anything to be worried about"".

   with the removal of my social media it has improved my mental status quite a bit. i realized that i dont need to post/prove anything to anyone because no one actually fucking cares if you're at a cool place or if you're having fun. no one cares, no one cares, no one cares. no living soul on my social media actually fucking cares about what i post or what i do with my life. no one cares. after i deleted my social media the only one that noticed messaged me was my sweet sweet bean, my male best friend that i talk to whenever i have something going on in my life. we'll refer to him as bean.

   no one else really noticed. because no one actually cares. bean has been there for me through almost everything this past year. he's been with me through my heart break, through the months that i actually lost myself (i'll probably talk about that in another entry.) but yeah, bean is almost always there for me. might be cheesey, but i love him. i love him for actually caring about me. i've has crushes on him from time to time but i know that we'll never be a thing, so i'll love him in secret. well, i've told him i love him but i dont think he thinks that i actually mean it, but i do. i love him platonically.

  i deleted my social media april 5th, 2019. prior to that i pushed people away. i told the girl i was seeing that i couldnt see her anymore and that broke her heart, how do i know? she told me. i broke down two days after a party i attended. i actually started hearing voices that weren't mine telling me that no one cared, everyone hates me, your friends are only there because they pity you, etc. thats what led me to deleting my social media, instagram, twitter, snapchat, and even facebook, fucking facebook.

  i felt okay for a while and what helped me feel better were the plants that i bought back in april. i think the plants i bought were a big part of me feeling better. they make me happy even though they just sit there and look pretty. it started out as three now i have eight plant babies. i plan on buying more as soon as i have money to spend. green is my favorite color and seeing the plants i have grow make me even happier.

   okay, well this is getting pretty long and i havent really talked about why i wrote this today, i'll talk about it briefly and then let whoever is reading this go. i felt down again for no reason today, i was folding my laundry and listening to music and it just it me right in the face out of nowhere. my chest became heavy and the tip of my nose started to get warm, like i was about to cry. i have absolutely no reason to feel this way nor cry like the baby that i am. i want to get better and im trying my best but these punches of sadness come out of nowhere and its a heavy burden. i've been avoiding seeing medical help even though everyone tells me to, but i think its getting to the point where i'm actually considering it. thank you to whoever read this whole thing. i expect no one to, as i only wrote this to get some of this feeling off my chest before i start bawling my eyes out. okay well, bye."
0,"Liking someone is kinda cool.

I‚Äôm thinking of making a playlist about love soon. I just like waking up knowing I‚Äôm gonna see someone I like seeing and I‚Äôd like something to accompany it. I haven‚Äôt had a crush for years now so I‚Äôm trying to make the most of it while I can, before we leave and it fades. It always fades. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing though because recently this crush has really been putting a dent in my heart. Knowing they like someone else yet wanting to reach for their hand just a foot away is painful.

The other day they said I was going to be great. I think they noticed I was having a panic attack and I really think I was, for real this time. I actually cried on the ride home. But they said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be great‚Äù and that was the best thing I could ever hear, but I still wanted to cry. After I left, all I kept thinking was what if I disappoint you or them or everyone or myself? What will happen then? I cried and cried and tried to hold it back as much as I could for the people looking at me, but it was that kind of crying that felt like you were swallowing shards of glass when trying to hold it back. Either way after they said that, I really felt like maybe I could be ok.

I got home and cried and slept, but I realized I wasn‚Äôt going to implode. I was ok. I was going to be great."

Another post.

Just cut my foot on a needle sticking out of my backpack. My toe is bleeding. I should wash it so it doesn‚Äôt get infected.

I don‚Äôt feel like it though.

I just sat outside for an hour working on covering my new copper plate in sharpie. I wanna try using that as a resist.

And I did some thinking. Some realizing about my future.

I just need to be thankful. Thankful for what I have.

F said something very profound to me once. He said that he doesn‚Äôt know a single artist who makes their living solely off of making art and selling it. He doesn‚Äôt personally know a single artist who just makes art all day long in their studio, and people flock to buy their art. The world just doesn‚Äôt work that way. He says that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to have a real job. One that connects art is best. A job that allows you to make what you love on the side.

But he never really had to think about that. He said he‚Äôs always wanted to be a teacher, since he was in elementary school. From the get go he‚Äôs taken child development classes, and just about every art class in high school. He‚Äôs always known what he‚Äôs wanted to do it seems like.

I wish I could say the same. I wish I could see my future now. I don‚Äôt want some grand life. It‚Äôs just not practical. Rich people are always so busy. Always doing so much.

Personally I wish I could just keep it simple. I wish I could just buy a trailer. One of those ones you can drive around on the back of a truck. I just need a bed, kitchen, table, bookshelf, and a space for my clothes and storage.

And I‚Äôd be happy. I could personalize it all I want, just living a quiet life. Whenever I get sick of the city I could just go park it out somewhere remote and just breathe. I don‚Äôt want a fancy job. I don‚Äôt know how to get one of those.

I need to save my money. I spent my whole fucking Paycheck in one weekend.

I need to cool down.

I gotta pay for college somehow. And I have 12$ to my name.

I wish I was small. Like a mouse. I wish I could shrink my room. My self. I want to be tiny. I‚Äôve always had tiny imaginary friends as a kid. Now I wish I could be them. I want a closet fort.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll make a closet fort.

My own tiny space.

For me."

It‚Äôs been such a food weekend. Wednesday onward has just been absolutely amazing. Every interaction I have with people has been above and beyond great.

I feel happy. For more than a day in a row.

Probably just a string of lucky days, probably won‚Äôt get this again for a while. I just hope the crash back to reality isn‚Äôt too hard.

I‚Äôm trying to be nicer to myself. I really am. It‚Äôs helped me a lot, but every day I still have urges to cut because it‚Äôs all I know now. I don‚Äôt want to. I do though.. ugh. I wish I could just be normal. I wish my emotions didn‚Äôt sway every three days. I wish the cycle would break. I just want one. Not both. I want to be continually happy, or continually sad.

Anyways, today was pretty great. Woke up. Went to church. Did the usual. Anne, Ali, P and I went to a local art fair in Brookside.

We got lunch at Panera because it‚Äôs the only place we all like though it‚Äôs hella expensive. Anne met us there and we carpooled with her. None of them had ever been to an art fair. I was really surprised. I thought everyone had been to one at one point in their lives or another.

Most of the art was lame, as usual, but each row had at least 5 or more interesting enough booths to walk into. Towards the end I discovered an amazing one. I started fangirling big time. It was an artist who made absolutely stunning lithographs and etchings. I‚Äôve never seen prints that beautiful with my own eyes. The colors were perfect. Everything was so well crafted.

I want to be like him.

I really do. I just keep going back on forth on what I love. Sometimes it‚Äôs meticulous ink drawings. Sometimes charcoal, sometimes random shit. Sometimes block carving or screen printing. But lately it always goes back to plain old drypoint etching.

I wish I had a style. I need to narrow it down a lot more before I finish my portfolio. WHICH REMINDS ME... I only have till December 1st to finish my portfolio for art school. I‚Äôm only a junior. I need around 20 pieces. I need to be making professional work NOW.

I need those fucking scholarships. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get them.

I need rules. Rules for me. Rules to make a body of work that looks like my work. Or at least what I want it to be.

Rule one: My portfolio can‚Äôt look like the rest. They don‚Äôt want to see 15 portraits of my friends and family. I‚Äôm no chuck close, and neither are they quite frankly.

Rule two: I need to diversify, but not too much.

Ahh screw a list of rules. I just need a list of ideas.
OR. I‚Äôll start on my AP portfolio early?

Update: I just re-read the AP studio art summer work list on our google classroom. And OHhh boy. I‚Äôve got a lot to do. I need to start now.

I need to finish my AP portfolio an entire semester or so early. Jesus. Ok. This is a lot to think about.

So shit... I want to talk to F about this. I should do some research first. Ahhh fuck. But I want to finish etching a plate tonight so I can stay after school tomorrow.

UGHH. MH LIFE IS A MESS. Fuck I need to think."
0,"05.05.19. Hangovers
Today I woke up at 6:45am on my friend‚Äôs couch after a heavy night of drinking.

I felt INCREDIBLE.

Most people don‚Äôt like hangovers.

My friend who I was staying with was hungover too.

She woke up when her alarm went off at 10:30am.

Went straight to the kitchen and chugged a glass of water.

Then she groaned and went to the bathroom.

Staggered out a few minutes later, visibly dreading being awake.

She was so pissed when I pulled open the curtains to let the sunlight in.

Hangovers are just different for me.

Weirdly, I never feel better than after a night of heavy drinking. I know that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs supposed to happen. But I always wake up feeling energized and alert.

I was up with the sun this morning. Felt so truly happy and at peace, for the first time in so long, that I thought I was still dreaming.

The first thing I said was, ‚ÄúYour couch is so comfortable! I‚Äôm pretty sure I had the best sleep I‚Äôve had since coming home!‚Äù

My friend thought I was nuts.

Truthfully, so did I.

But the energy and brightness kept up all day. Even after I got back home.

Physically, I feel shitty now. After all, I‚Äôm only human.

But I almost always feel shitty. So most of the time I don‚Äôt even notice the difference.

Huh.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really get affected by hangovers.

I‚Äôm so used to the symptoms by now, I rarely even notice them unless I try - and why would I do that?

But mentally, nothing feels as good as waking up hungover.

My head feels clear. The ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù has totally gone away. I was cheerful and chatty all morning.

And I finally got to put ‚Äúgood‚Äù into my mood diary. It felt SO good to hit the smiley face button. And to see that little yellow circle break the blue/grey streak.

I feel more like myself - my old self - than I have in a very long time. I can‚Äôt remember how long it‚Äôs been. Maybe even longer than since last March.

I always forget that this happens until it does. But now that I‚Äôve noticed it, this is not going to help stop my budding drinking habit.

It probably wasn‚Äôt the drinking alone that did it.

I also got to see my old friends, who I always enjoy spending time with. I‚Äôm really comfortable around them, they‚Äôre lovely people.

And I got to go out! Downtown is a hell of a party scene where I‚Äôm from. Nothing like the town where I go to school. The clubs there are awful.

Last time I partied here, back when I was still sexually active, a guy offered me coke if I fucked him.

I didn‚Äôt, but we made out and groped each other a bit.

What can I say?

I‚Äôm a sucker for a good beard, and he felt the same about short skirts.

I actually forgot that happened until my friends reminded me last night.

Reminiscing with them, and getting to update each other with all our new stories, is always so much fun. They‚Äôre really great people.

Nothing like that guy happened last night.

I didn‚Äôt want to be hit on, so I wore a giant sweater and high-waisted jeans. Plus, I‚Äôve gotten chubby. Nobody looked twice at me.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I was so relaxed.

Or maybe it was all the shots. We did a lot of shots. Or at least, I did.

I did more than everyone else, because I couldn‚Äôt have any beer. So people just kept buying me shots so I wouldn‚Äôt feel left out.

I guess even an autoimmune disorder has its silver lining.

I‚Äôm really grateful that my friends helped me find the bright side. My sister and I have been really upset about the potential diagnosis. Last night helped me keep things in perspective.

But the point is, going out when I‚Äôm home is a lot of fun. My friends are fun. Drugs and alcohol are definitely fun.

My good mood could have come from a good time.

But, I really think it was the alcohol. And the edibles.

Since I haven‚Äôt had any weed in days (since I had to leave it back at school, ugh), my thoughts have been racing non-stop. That, combined with my shitty home life, was really getting me down.

I didn‚Äôt even realize how awful I‚Äôd been feeling until I stopped.

God, I love drinking.

Weed is my drug of choice, for sure. I like it more than all the others. It does everything I need.

But weed makes me think more. It makes your neurons fire up. Which is great when I need to just disconnect from the world for a while.

But alcohol does the opposite. It turns all my thoughts off. Lets me just be here.

For a few hours, I was totally present. No anxiety- not even in the big crowds while clubbing. No worrying about the past or the future or even the present. No sadness, no numbness, no overthinking.

Last night, I got to be 19 years old again. I got to have a night of reckless fun. I got to just be alive.

And when I went to sleep, I could. No staying up thinking. No bad dreams. No anxiety or feeling unsafe, even though I wasn‚Äôt in my room. I got to fall asleep worn out with joy instead of tears.

In the morning, I did get a bit anxious about all that. It made me feel guilty to have that much fun.

I didn‚Äôt have a single panic attack or flashback or anything - not even in the big crowd. I didn‚Äôt get tired of socializing after an hour. I didn‚Äôt have to leave early. And I slept so well.

Does that mean I made everything up?

It‚Äôs confusing, because I like being better. I want to be better. I‚Äôve been trying really, really hard to get better.

But then when it happens, I freak out. It feels like it happened too fast to be real. So, I must have faked ever being sick in the first place.

Which is crazy, because it‚Äôs been over a year now since this all started. I feel like I‚Äôve been miserable forever. How can I just forget all that suffering in just one night?

Not to mention all the work I‚Äôve been doing.

It‚Äôs not like I just got better out of nowhere. I‚Äôve been trying as hard as I can. But that feels like a lie, too, when it actually works. I don‚Äôt know why.

I also can‚Äôt help but wait for the other shoe to drop. That feeling of doom is always there, even if alcohol makes it quieter.

I think it‚Äôs just that feeling safe and ok is so unfamiliar to me. Usually, it just means something bad is about to happen. So whenever I feel like this, it really messes with my head.

Also, sometimes I start to worry that if I feel too good, then I won‚Äôt need help anymore.

It makes me scared to think about losing what little support I have right now. Once I‚Äôm better, I‚Äôll be alone again.

That thought makes my stomach hurt.

Or maybe it‚Äôs just the hangover.

Hopefully by the time I‚Äôm better I‚Äôll really be better, more than I ever was before. That way I won‚Äôt slide back into bad habits and end up like this again.

I never want to be this way again. I‚Äôll do anything to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen.

But if my biggest worry for today is that I feel too good, I‚Äôm fine with that.

I almost never feel like this - I‚Äôm gonna ride this wave until it hits the shore.

And when all the alcohol and exhaustion leaves my system, hopefully I can stay like this, with my mind nice and quiet.

But if not, at least now I know what to do about it.

I love hangovers.

...

Update:

Today ended up being a really good day.

Two of the kids barged into my room not long after I got home, while I was still brushing my teeth.

Kids don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre hungover. Luckily, neither do I.

The baby was taking a nap and the others were out of the house, so I got to give the seven and four year olds some special attention.

First we played hide and seek.

The older one is a nightmare to play with; she always finds a way to vanish off the face of the earth.

Today she somehow managed to worm her way into the tiny crevice between the couch and the floor. I didn‚Äôt know anything could fit under there, let alone a child!

I never would have found her if not for the giggling.

The younger one doesn‚Äôt have quite the same natural talent for disappearing, but she does her best.

Today she hid right behind me, where I couldn‚Äôt see her. She made sure to grab the back of my shirt so she could stay hidden in case I tried to turn around.

Then, just to be certain she‚Äôd found the ultimate hiding spot, she told me, ‚ÄúPretend you don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm here!‚Äù

So, at least she‚Äôs self-aware.

Later, since it was such a nice day, I took them to the park. We even took the dog.

To show how grateful he was, he decided to help keep the park clean by eating all the trash he could find.

But he‚Äôs just so cute, I didn‚Äôt have the heart to get mad at him. I just pretended not to see. I‚Äôll make one of the adults deal with it when he pukes it all up later.

It was gorgeous out today, bright and sunny.

We played robber because, as the older one kindly pointed out, ‚ÄúYou look like a criminal.‚Äù

Robber is a pretty fun game, though, because it ends with the kids jumping on me and tackling me to the ground.

I get to give them lots of hugs and kisses as we lay in a big dog pile.

The kids played for about 15 minutes before they got too hot and started fighting.

Despite that seemingly short time, we were out for about an hour.

Tired kids + walking in the heat = a very slow trip home.

I mean, that‚Äôs just basic math.

So we took breaks in the shady spots we found along the way.

Each break we found worms or ants or cool rocks. Who knows? Maybe they even learned something. (But that‚Äôs probably just wishful thinking on my part.)

We made it home, and their grandparents had come to visit. They brought a scavenger hunt, so the kids are busy now, and I can hide away for a bit before bedtime.

I just wanted to write this down before I forget the little details.

Because they really do grow up fast, and I‚Äôm gonna miss a lot of it while I‚Äôm away.

I took a couple pictures of them throughout the week, but most of the time when I‚Äôm with them I try to put my phone away.

They deserve some undivided attention.

They‚Äôre really, really good kids.

I love them so much.

...

Second update:

I played soccer with the kids and helped them ride their bikes until the sun went down.

Then we went in and had snacks before bedtime.

When it was time to go, I told the four year old that she could have one more sip of milk, and then she had to go.

That little smartass chugged her glass and held as much milk in her mouth as she could, eyes wide and cheeks puffed out.

She figured if she never swallowed her last sip, she could stay forever and I‚Äôd never make her go to bed.

I tricked her into swallowing the milk by asking her a question that she‚Äôd have to speak to answer. By the time she realized what I‚Äôd done, it was too late.

Also, me and the baby had a full conversation in babble talk. I have no idea what he got from it, but he was grinning like a madman the entire time.

I hope I didn‚Äôt tell him anything incriminating.

Honestly, being home is exhausting.

But even though I‚Äôm overworked and under appreciated here, I can‚Äôt help but keep doing it.

I love them.

And I‚Äôm really grateful today was a good day."

I was hoping it wouldn't rain today so I could go on a walk as I did yesterday. For some reason I'm feeling like I'm in a sort of mania. I can't control my thoughts, I can't focus and my behavior is very much odd. I'm happy that I'm able to spot these but it doesn't help. The only thing that helps me in situations like that is going to bed and trying to fall asleep. I do dumb and regrettable stuff in moments like this. This entry is short because I can't focus on anything today.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have been talking with S yesterday a lot. I'm still not sure how I'm feeling about it.

Dating as a gay man is quite hard. There are a lot of obstacles that I seem to be unable to overcome. I have no idea how to proceed with my dating life in general."
0,"04.05.19. What if things never get better?
Today started off like any other day.

I woke up and immediately wished I hadn‚Äôt.

Fuck, I hate being alive. I feel so trapped here. Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I even CAN die.

Sometimes I have dreams where I kill myself and nothing happens, because I‚Äôm already in Hell.

I used to not believe in an afterlife. Now, I‚Äôm too afraid to think about it. What could possibly be worse than this?

I try so hard to get better. Every single day. And sometimes it works, for a little bit.

But it never holds up. Something else always goes wrong eventually.

I‚Äôm just so tired.

I‚Äôm tired of hoping and being let down.

I‚Äôm tired of trying and failing.

I‚Äôm tired of finding the courage to speak up and being ignored. Or having no one around to even hear.

I‚Äôm tired of opening myself up to the world just to be filled with more hurt and sadness and despair.

I‚Äôm tired of having to keep getting back up again.

I try to keep telling myself it gets better. It has to, because I can‚Äôt live like this forever.

But I don‚Äôt know if it actually does.

Does it?

Every day I choose hope, because it‚Äôs the only thing that gets me out of bed every morning.

The people who don‚Äôt want me dead also don‚Äôt want to deal with me when I‚Äôm too depressed to function. So I have to get out of bed. I have to try to get better.

But I don‚Äôt even know if I can.

I don‚Äôt actually KNOW that things get better.

That‚Äôs just something I tell myself, because that‚Äôs what supportive people say to the main character in books and movies. And it helps them get back up again and win, so the story has a happy ending.

I‚Äôve never had anyone tell me things get better.

At my lowest, I‚Äôve always been alone.

When we were making my suicide safety plan, my counsellor asked me what I wanted.

She said everyone has things that make being alive easier, and we just have to find mine, so I can find her motivation to live.

I told her I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm a very privileged person. There‚Äôs never been a single thing I couldn‚Äôt have if I just asked for it.

When I was in the hospital, my parents asked me what I wanted. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything.

So they brought me a laptop. A stuffed toy. Books. A hairbrush. Soft pyjamas. Pictures of my siblings.

My dad always says: ‚ÄúAnything for you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the oldest story in the world.

My parents gave me everything.

But at night, when I was scared and hurting, all I had to hold was a hairbrush and a new laptop.

I was surrounded by nice things.

But the nicest things in the world don‚Äôt drown out the bad thoughts or ease the pain.

I learned to cry silently, because sometimes they drugged the patients who made too much noise.

The only reminder I got to stay calm came from the Velcro straps dangling off my bed‚Äôs guard rails.

You did *not* want a person to come remind you.

I‚Äôd seen what they did to the patients who forgot.

It often involved the straps.

When my counsellor asked me what I wanted, I told her I didn‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve never really wanted anything. My parents gave me everything I‚Äôve ever asked for.

She asked me what I wanted.

I‚Äôve never had another person stick around when I‚Äôm in pain.

I‚Äôve never had anyone hug me when I cry.

I‚Äôve never had anyone tell me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Usually, if anything, they tell me it‚Äôs not.

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is for someone to notice when something‚Äôs wrong.

No matter how bad things get, people will only give me exactly what I ask for.

But what happens when I don‚Äôt know what to ask for?

My cousin once had a psychotic breakdown and pulled a knife on my grandmother.

We couldn‚Äôt have her committed for longer than 72 hours. Since she was an adult, she would have to go voluntarily or sign away her rights to someone else.

But she was so delusional, she couldn‚Äôt even see that she had a problem. So she wouldn‚Äôt go.

It was like being back at the hospital - legally, our hands were tied.

But we knew that even though she was too sick to ask for it, she still needed help.

People will help me if I ask for it.

They‚Äôll do exactly what I tell them I need, nothing more and nothing less. It‚Äôs a blessing to have people who are willing to help.

But sometimes, I‚Äôm too sick to notice anything‚Äôs wrong until it‚Äôs too late.

Sometimes I don‚Äôt even know what I need.

And sometimes, I just don‚Äôt know how to ask.

When my counsellor asked me what I wanted, and I told her I didn‚Äôt know.

But I do.

I know exactly what I want.

I just want someone to give me a hug and tell me that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok.

Because sometimes I need another person to believe it for me, when I feel too hopeless. And sometimes I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to deal with all this all alone.

Sometimes I just want proof that someone cares. I know they do. But sometimes people make it really hard to remember.

And I want them to stay with me for as long as I need, without me having to ask. Just because they want to, because they want me to feel better.

I wish there wasn‚Äôt always a time limit on my pain.

I wish someone didn‚Äôt care how long it took.

But I couldn‚Äôt tell my counsellor that.

Because it‚Äôs embarrassing.

Because then she‚Äôd ask me who I want it to be.

And I don‚Äôt know.

Because there‚Äôs no one I can think of who would do that. Even if I did ask.

Plenty of people care about me. They really do want to see me happy. But no one wants to see me sad.

How can I be happy if I can‚Äôt be sad?

I can‚Äôt remember what we ended up putting on my suicide safety plan.

Not that it matters. It didn‚Äôt help.

Will anything help?

I really, really want to get better. But I‚Äôm afraid that I can‚Äôt. Because the thing I want isn‚Äôt something I can have.

Alright, I think that‚Äôs enough sitting around being sad for today.

I guess this is just one of those days that feels hopeless.

It‚Äôs ok, I know it will pass. It always does.

It feels hopeless right now, but I know that‚Äôs just a feeling. I know it will get better once I stop sitting around pitying myself.

And even if it doesn‚Äôt, I have to pull myself together. It‚Äôs Saturday night - I have plans later.

Tonight I‚Äôm going clubbing with my friends.

I‚Äôm gonna get wasted.

...

Update:

My mom said, ‚ÄúIf you go out tonight, don‚Äôt bother coming home.‚Äù

So guess who‚Äôs staying out all night! üéâ

I asked my friend if I could crash at her place tonight, hopefully she gets back soon. Otherwise I‚Äôll just bar hop until morning, lol.

This day has really turned around! I knew it would."

I've started the day with a power walk and some exercise. I felt better afterwards. I've always negated the need to exercise on a daily basis. While I'm still skeptical, I'm inclined to try it and see how things go. So far so good!

I'm hoping to improve the condition of body in general. I'm beginning to pay more attention to my skin. I've been moisturizing and exfoliating regularly and I'm already seeing improvements.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I've been thinking a lot about therapy last night. While there are certain aspects I don't like, I do think I'm getting the help and attention I need.

The relationship between me and my therapist seems quite mysterious to me. I'm not used to talking about myself so much, especially when I know nothing about the other person. Therapy is challenging and I like challenges. I'm willing to continue.

I've been making best efforts to understand the therapeutic process as a whole. Not only that but also how the mental health system works. I want learn what options I have and what could be best for me.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I'm still talking to the S guy. He seems to be kind and honest. I don't  what I should do next. Do I ask him on a date? I'll have to think about that a little bit more."

I am so tired.

I got an award at the show.

But it was the fucking basketball poster.

THE FUCKING BASKETBALL POSTER.

Is my art shit?

My art must be shit.

I got home after work and watched that new twilight zone series by Jordan Peele. Then suddenly I got really angry.

I was angry at the judges for not picking my drawings. Mine were good. I am looking forward to going tomorrow and seeing who the fucks art won.

So I only work like 6 hours tomorrow. I won‚Äôt complain about that.

But I was so angry. So I started a drawing out of spite. I got out of bed, looked at myself in the mirror, and told myself I‚Äôm fucking amazing and I don‚Äôt care if anyone gives a shit now because I‚Äôm still growing. But I‚Äôm gonna be the fucking best.

I got my big drawing board I bought today with the large pad of paper and just started drawing trees. Tons of trees in a Forrest. Wonky looking trees. Like a night scene from the xfiles almost.

After like 40 mins of drawing I got a massive headache. I took a break and went to the bathroom and got something to drink.

Then I read. Just read and read. I‚Äôm on page 197 now. I started it last night. I‚Äôm proud of myself in a way. I miss reading. I used to be such a book nerd.

The last thing I want to become is a book nerd. I just want to be smart. And I know for a fact that reading is my missing element.

I can‚Äôt wait to finish my fucking masterpiece of a drawing. It may not be conceptually advanced. But it‚Äôs gonna be so beautiful. So detailed.

I‚Äôm gonna pass out now."

Today was fine.

I woke up in a mood, probably because I was worn out from all the screaming and crying of yesterday. My eyes still felt puffy when I woke up.

I took it out on the kettle as I made some tea to deal with the exhaustion and brain fog.

How dare the laws of physics make me *wait* for the water to boil instead of heating up to the perfect temperature instantaneously? That‚Äôs 3 minutes of my life, gone forever!

I recently got a mood tracker app, and today I finally had enough logs for it to show me my mood chart. It‚Äôs almost entirely made up of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, with little spikes up and down here or there as I remember to log them.

But today felt pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

Most days nowadays feel pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

I can‚Äôt remember when the last time was that I had a day I just enjoyed, all day long.

Being alive has just gotten so exhausting. I‚Äôm over it.

There are moments that I like. There are plenty of things that I appreciate. And there are people that I care about enough to not kill myself.

And I‚Äôm still hopeful that I can make things better if I try hard enough. Really, really hopeful.

But most of the time, I could take or leave this whole ‚Äúbeing alive‚Äù business.

I don‚Äôt mind being here anymore. Most days it‚Äôs not the hellish nightmare that it used to be, not long ago.

But I wouldn‚Äôt mind being hit by a bus, either. I‚Äôm cool with whatever.

My mom has been extra clingy all day, which isn‚Äôt helping. She‚Äôs said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every five minutes. It‚Äôs SO annoying.

She followed me around all day, kept knocking on my door and asking me if I need anything. Honestly, all I want is some space.

I actually had to go out for a walk for a few hours just to get away from her.

That ended up being alright, despite the weather.

I found a tree fort in the sketchy part of the woods my mom always tells me not to go near because of all the girls who get murdered there.

The fort was full of blankets and empty beer bottles. It was the perfect shelter from the rain. I carved my initials into one of the trees and then stayed for a few hours to read my book.

The book I‚Äôm reading is really good. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúDaisy Jones and The Six‚Äù, and it‚Äôs just the kind of book I needed.

Eventually, I went back home. My mom continued to be unrelenting. Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll go back to the tree fort with my own beer bottles.

Oh wait - forgot I can‚Äôt drink beer anymore. Stupid fucking celiac. Autoimmune disorders suck.

Fine, I‚Äôll bring wine. Who cares? As long as I can drink. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot lately.

I‚Äôm used to a certain amount of alone time now, and I find it really difficult to deal with people who infringe on my space. My mom never used to be one of those people.

But today she was all over me. It‚Äôs weird.

I think she‚Äôs trying to repair our relationship, or make up for, like, 19 years of shitty things she‚Äôs suddenly found she has to forgive herself for.

I wish it would go back to when I was in charge of fixing things. I‚Äôm much better at it. She‚Äôs just making things worse. But I can‚Äôt even be mad at her, because she‚Äôs trying. Ugh.

I‚Äôm already over yesterday. I forgive her, as always. I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôve learned how to move on quickly. But she still cares, a lot.

I don‚Äôt expect her promise to change to stick (she‚Äôs made similar promises in her past on the rare occasion someone - usually me - makes her confront her own behaviour), but it was nice to know she really doesn‚Äôt mean it. That helps.

But like... can she deal with her own emotions without dragging me into it, please? LOL. I already know she can‚Äôt, so I tried to be sensitive. I said ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù, even though I didn‚Äôt really mean it and hate saying it.

She asked me to sleep in her bed with her after last night. What the fuck? Honestly, it‚Äôs kind of pathetic.

I guess she just didn‚Äôt want to sleep alone after last night, since my dad‚Äôs gambling in Vegas this week.

I feel kind of bad that I said no, and left her with all those emotions. She probably could have used some comfort. But I left her alone with the guilt instead.

But then I had a memory, of when she got the phone call from my school after I was found with the pills.

She called me into her room. Told me what the school told her. That I was suicidal and planning to act on it, and this was considered an emergency.

Then she broke down crying and said: ‚ÄúWhy would you do this to me? We gave you everything. Now they‚Äôre gonna think I‚Äôm a bad mom.‚Äù

And I had to hold her while she cried. When she was done, she sent me to my room.

She left me alone with that guilt, too.

She never even asked me what was wrong. What had made me suffer so much that I would take my own life at only 13, when I was still just a kid.

So last night, I thought to myself: She‚Äôll be fine.

And I fell asleep.

I think I‚Äôve run out of sympathy for my mom.

What am I gonna do for Mother‚Äôs Day? I‚Äôll have to do something extra nice after this blowout or it will crush her. And she apologized, so she deserves something to make her feel special.

But my heart‚Äôs just not in it.

I haven‚Äôt done anything big for Mother‚Äôs Day in years.

I tried a few years ago.

I learned origami, Spent an obscene amount of time making 52 paper stars. Each one had a little handwritten note on it, with a compliment or a memory or something. I put the stars in a nice jar.

When I gave it to her, she said: ‚ÄúNice. Trash in a jar.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúThey have notes inside. You can open one every week for a year, until next Mother‚Äôs Day.‚Äù

I showed her by opening one. Gave her the note. She read it, then crumpled it and dropped it somewhere.

Then she said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet.‚Äù

Then she locked eyes with me and dumped them all in the trash.

Kept the jar, though.

I haven‚Äôt bothered with Mother‚Äôs Day since. Usually I just give her a hug and tell her I love her. Or I get her a nice card.

My dad always gets her something, so I figured it was fine.

But last year she started complaining that we never get her anything. She wants something to make her feel loved.

I can‚Äôt help but empathize. I feel the same way.

I won‚Äôt even be here on Mother‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôll be back at school by then. So theoretically I don‚Äôt have to do anything. I have the perfect excuse.

But I‚Äôll feel bad. I have to do something. And it‚Äôll be easier since I can just leave it here for her and won‚Äôt have to be here to deal with her reaction.

The problem is, I‚Äôve kind of stopped caring about everything. I‚Äôm completely apathetic.

How am I supposed to express the kind of love my mom needs? I can‚Äôt even feel it."

This is a first one for me.

For the last couple of months I‚Äôve been terribly lonely, sad and anxious. I think the decline in my overall mental wellbeing has been going on even longer, I just didn‚Äôt notice it as much. After experiencing a loss and a painful breakup earlier this year, it hit me hard.

I started to look for help, I knew I needed it. Making the first move and actually scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist was quite hard but I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve managed to do it. I was prescribed medication and I‚Äôve been going to therapy for 3 months now. Things are slowly getting better for me in terms of dealing with anxiety and negative thoughts but there is still a lot of work to do.

I‚Äôve been thinking of starting a diary like that for a moment now. I feel like this could potentially help me better understand my thoughts and feelings.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Ever since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend I was torn between jumping right back into dating and taking a break for myself. I tried to do both but I‚Äôm yet to have any success with the dating part.

Meeting new people is hard, especially when you‚Äôre socially anxious. I‚Äôm unable to pick up any cues which makes things even more complicated for me.

This week I started talking to a guy (let‚Äôs call him S) I seem to be compatible with in terms of values. While we disagree sometimes, the conversations are surprisingly engaging for me.

S is the kind of a person I‚Äôd usually avoid but there is something interesting about him. I‚Äôm curious to see where things go.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôve been changing a lot lately. I‚Äôve started to take care of myself more. I‚Äôm exercising, I‚Äôm thinking of getting a tattoo.

When I was younger, I thought that I‚Äôd grow into a certain person and remain that very same way for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm starting to see that I‚Äôm constantly evolving and that this process will never stop.

I‚Äôve also changed my mind about my past by far. I‚Äôm not ashamed of who I was anymore."

OH MY GOD.
TODAY WAS AMAZING.

I went in to F‚Äôs room this morning to drop off my art for the show and get a seminar pass. He was super cheerful. I had my hot chocolate, and overall now I was in a great mood.

Took a math quiz, got along with Gib and Brooke well. Then I went to seminar. It was fun. F matted my work and I made tags for them. I asked him some questions about the show this weekend and apparently it‚Äôs all on Saturday this year and not Sunday. So he can‚Äôt even make it at all saturday. And neither can I unless I get an award and can ask off from work. I was kind of bummed out about that.

English went well. Lunch was fine. F walked by me and river when we were eating in the hall, and again as we were walking to English. 6th hour was pretty boring. I was watching this really interesting video on books and how to read more throughout your daily life. I got super inspired and want to start my own collection. First on my list is to buy a bookshelf. I found one for 30$ at IKEA. I want to buy my own copy of Art and Fear, and a few others like Tom Robbins etc. I want to order books online now.

As class was ending I tried to be helpful and ask F if he needed any help with the art fair stuff. He had SO much to hang up and I felt so bad for him. He‚Äôd be there all night hanging it up alone. I secretly wished I could come along and help. And then the bell rang. River and Logan came in and we talked for a bit. I asked F again if there was anything I could do to help. Then he was saying he just wished he had help hanging it up. I said I‚Äôd help, Logan chimed in and said he‚Äôd help too. Then F asked us if we could come along to help. OMG I was so excited!!! I said of course, I‚Äôd love to. I texted dad and he said it was ok. Logan ended up riding with his mom there so it was just me and F in his car. I wasn‚Äôt very talkative at first, but I loosened up.

But sitting in that car. I‚Äôve rode in his car a few times before for different things. Collab, the radio show thing, imagine that, etc. It wasn‚Äôt totally weird. But that feeling. Just two pals going to hang up some mother fuckin art. Hell yeah!! We talked about middle school, we talked about Ira, we talked about Zoe, we talked about lots. It was only a 10 min drive but it was great. When we got to the school we went in to scope out what was happening, when we got up to the door he art teacher there propped it open and said they were ready for stuff. So we walked back out to the car to grab the art. There was an art teacher who only wore Hawaiian shirts we talked about. And we talked about how he talked to our principal about having a gallery space just like the school we were at now. We talked about the M mall. About M and some of my childhood memories there. We set our stuff down on a table. Logan met us in the gym. F had him sort art into categories while I went back to the car with him to grab some more paintings.

And we hung up art. Pretty simple. I had to run out to his car to grab a sheet of paper with names on it. I unlocked his car. It was weird. But I felt trusted. He really does trust me. It means the world to me. I know the password to his laptop, and now I‚Äôve got the keys to his car in my hand. F trusts me. :-)

So we hung up a lot of stuff. Lots and lot. 145 pieces to be exact. Alex C showed up while we were hanging up some of the last stuff. These two art teachers were getting on our cases about spreading stuff out, when we were doing a perfectly fine job. Even F thought so. They were so annoying. I told Alex how thankful I am we have F. She agreed. We kind of bonded a bit. She‚Äôs super nice. Shes one of the few IB seniors I get along with well.

When we finished we walked around for a bit and looked at all the art as a group and talked about what we thought would win awards etc. it was really fun. I got to be really frank and so did F and it was interesting to hear him talk about student work. I kinda get the feeling he doesn‚Äôt like art for the sake of art. Like a big technical drawing of a subway for instance. I agreed with him, but I still thought they‚Äôd get awards because that‚Äôs what the classes teach anyways.

He was surprised there wasn‚Äôt more darkroom photography from other schools. Apparently none of the teachers really know how to teach it. I am SO thankful for F. He is so amazing.

When we were leaving I asked him if he could drop me by school on the way back. He said sure! Then when we were getting in the car I called grandma because I was going to her house regardless. Zoe answered and just realized mid-call that grandma only lives like 4 mins from school. I asked F if he would be okay with dropping me off at my grandmas. I figured it‚Äôd be okay to ask since he offered to drop me off at my house earlier. He said he‚Äôd be happy to. So we headed off towards grandmas.

We talked about sleep, and getting up in the morning, and a whole myriad of things. It‚Äôs so great just to talk to people like that. One on one. And especially him of all people. It was just nice to have time to talk with him right before the end of the school year. He thanked me multiple times for helping him hang up stuff. I said I was happy to help! I really do enjoy helping. I just want to be useful. The last thing on earth I want to be is a bother. Then we pulled up to grandmas. I got out of the car and thanked him for driving me. Zoe and grandma were looking out the window and Zoe was waving to me. Apparently as I was walking in, F waved to Zoe. He‚Äôs hilarious. A real riot.

Grandma made the most awesome casserole. And the most heavenly pudding. I took a few photos and videos and posted them to my story. Some birds, and the pudding etc. We sat outside for a bit and I asked grandma if we could go to Barnes and noble. She said sure. So we went!

I bought 3 books. Grandma bought my fourth. I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy one more. But my direct deposit goes in tomorrow morning so it should be okay. I am literally so excited about books. God, they‚Äôre so amazing. So crisp and beautiful. I want to start a bookshelf. I want to do my room!

I‚Äôm gonna start saving. I need to start saving pretty badly. Tomorrow I need to buy that drawing board though. I think I‚Äôm gonna save up all my money till camp. I really wanna do my room. So bad. I just wanna paint and get those desk/shelves.

Oh so the books I got were, Jitterbug Perfume, by Tom Robbins. Even Cowgirls get the Blues, by Tom Robbins. The Road by Jack Kur‚Äî- and shit. Nope I bought the wrong book. I wanted On the Road. Not the Road. FUCK. Whatever. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine. And last of all, Girl in pieces. I first saw the book and thought the charcoal lettering looked really cool. Then I was reading the synopsis and it said something about scars. There was a red line on the back that looked like a cut but not really. I thoughtI was seeing things. Then I flipped the book over and realized the words were crossed through with red slashes. This is a book that deals with self harm I guess. I considered buying it, then I thought about, what if dad or someone else looks at it? What if ZOE sees it?! She‚Äôs the only one at home who knows about my self harm (kinda.) But I bought it. Because I really wanna read it now.

I‚Äôm excited. Today was amazing. More than I could have ever asked for. I can‚Äôt wait to start living MY life.

Things are going to work. And work well."
0,"02.05.19. I‚Äôm an idiot
Today started out alright.

I woke up home alone because all the kids were already at school. Played with the cat, hung out for a bit, took a depression nap on the basement couch, lost track of time.

Eventually I got bored and lonely and sick of sitting around pitying myself. So I called my mom.

She‚Äôs been better lately. Not a lot, but a little. And I‚Äôve been better lately, too.

Since I gave up expecting anything from my parents, now I can just ask them for exactly what I want when I want it. As long as it‚Äôs not too much, they‚Äôll usually do it, and our relationship has improved significantly because of this.

So I called my mom, and today she picked up.

She said, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúAttention.‚Äù

She said, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll be home soon. I‚Äôll come down.‚Äù

And I said, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

And she said, ‚ÄúNo problem, baby.‚Äù

It was all so nice.

My mom did exactly what she said. She came down once she got home and snuggled with me on the couch for a few minutes. It was awesome. She even made me grilled cheese after.

Things were good.

I guess that‚Äôs why I let my guard down.

My mom went out again later, and I went out too. I went for a walk in the park, and played with strangers‚Äô dogs, and wasted time on my phone.

When I‚Äôm home, I like to spend the weekdays alone and/or out of the house. Occasionally I even hang out with friends, as long as we go somewhere. As long as I can escape for a bit.

It helps me get ready for the evenings, when everyone gets home. That‚Äôs when things tend to get messy.

Even though I try my best to enjoy my days off while I‚Äôm here, that sense of impending doom follows me.

So I wasn‚Äôt thrilled when I noticed I had an email. I got that familiar pit in my stomach when I saw it. An email, like everything else in my life, is usually bad news.

Was it my new landlord, with another problem with my banking info or a form I forgot to sign?

Or was it school related - my accommodations assessment was cancelled or rebooked, I missed a tuition payment, something went wrong with my appeal, or anything else?

Was it a friend or classmate or fellow club member, angry at me for missing something important?

Or was it my aunt, who the restraining order didn‚Äôt go through for- was she stalking me again? She started with emails last time, too.

Or who knows? Maybe it was a new crisis; something I couldn‚Äôt even imagine yet.

Really, it could be anything.

I groaned inwardly and made myself click the email icon to see what disaster was hiding behind that little red notification bubble.

It was from the local animal shelter.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. What could this be about?

I clicked on the email. I read the first few lines in confusion before I put the pieces together.

Months ago, right when I was first starting to pull myself out of my massive depressive episode, I had applied to be a volunteer at the animal shelter.

I figured I‚Äôd be a decent applicant: I love animals, I had experience working at a vet clinic in high school, and now that I was on medical leave, I had lots of free time to volunteer and a very flexible (read: completely empty) schedule.

I hadn‚Äôt expected to ever hear back from them. Demand for people who want to spend time hanging out with adorable animals is significantly smaller than supply, unsurprisingly.

But here in my inbox was an email asking me which date I was free for training.

The position I‚Äôd been chosen for?

Cat cuddler!

Sometimes, dreams really do come true.

That‚Äôs when I made my first mistake.

I yelled for my mom.

Things had been so good all day. And our shared love of cats is one of the few things we bond over. It didn‚Äôt even occur to me to worry about telling her.

I called her name, once, to see if she was even home.

I heard her yell back from her room, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

So I raced over and knocked on her door, grinning and bouncing where I stood as I waited for her to come out.

She opened the door and took one look at me and snapped: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù

I froze.

She continued, snarling, ‚ÄúWhy did you scream like that? Look what you did to me! Feel my chest- you gave me heart palpitations! Jesus, what is such a big deal that you feel the need to run over here screaming like some sort of animal? I thought the house was burning down!‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I made my second mistake.

I felt my smile fall off my face, and forgot to hide my hurt as I stared at her in sadness.

I didn‚Äôt mean to. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting that reaction. But it never matters what I meant to do.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal,‚Äù I backtracked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! I was just excited about something. But you ruined it- I‚Äôm not excited anymore. Never mind, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

That was my third mistake. I attacked her.

I forgot I‚Äôm only supposed to use ‚ÄúI statements‚Äù.

Then I tried to leave. I felt like such an idiot. My moment of happiness was gone. I just wanted to go back to my room and be alone again before I made things even worse.

But my mom hates thinking she did something wrong. She wasn‚Äôt going to let me leave until she was certain she did the right thing as a parent.

‚ÄúTell me what happened right now, I swear to god! Why do you torture me like this? You can‚Äôt just say you got excited about something and then not tell me, that‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù

So when I slumped my gaze to the ground and muttered, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt want to tell you now. I‚Äôm not excited anymore,‚Äù she lost her mind.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôd better tell me now, after what you did to me,‚Äù she hissed, grabbing my phone out of my hands.

Fourth mistake. I grabbed it right back.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I snapped at her. ‚ÄúI got a volunteer position at the animal shelter, but I don‚Äôt want to tell you about it if you‚Äôre gonna make me feel like shit!‚Äù

I stormed back to my room. My mom followed me, yelling all the while. I wish I could remember exactly what she said, but I tuned most of it out.

Once she‚Äôd gotten all the yelling out of her system, my mom was pretty excited about the job.

I knew she would be. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to cuddle cats? Like any good mom, she wanted to talk about it.

But my mood was completely ruined.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore! I want to be alone now. Can you please just leave me alone?‚Äù

My mom did not like that one bit.

‚ÄúWhat, so that‚Äôs it? You tell me about this and then you won‚Äôt give me any details? Why, because I ‚Äòyelled‚Äô at you? You‚Äôre so sensitive. Can you honestly never let things go? I only yelled because YOU made it seem like there was an emergency! Why do you always act like such a child?‚Äù

I lost it.

‚ÄúGet out of my room get out get out GET OUT NOW!‚Äù

She rolled her eyes in disgust.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a fucking brat. You always overreact.‚Äù

But then she finally left.

I locked my door, fell onto my bed and burst into tears.

How had I gone from elated to a temper tantrum in the span of literally two minutes?

But even as I asked the question I knew the answer.

I should have known better than to try to share it with my mom.

I never tell my mom any sort of news right away. She needs to be told in a very casual, non-committal way, significantly after the fact.

She‚Äôs like a bloodhound sniffing out fear. And joy. And everything else.

I didn‚Äôt tell her that I got accepted to every university I applied to until four months after the last letter came in.

I didn‚Äôt tell her when I got my period until I accidentally bled through my pants while we were at dinner.

I didn‚Äôt tell her about my first kiss until my sister made a joke about it and my mom overheard.

I didn‚Äôt tell her I wanted to kill myself until she got a call from my school saying they‚Äôd found the pills.

I knew better than to tell her about this.

It‚Äôs just an animal shelter- it didn‚Äôt even matter. It wasn‚Äôt worth it. But I forgot, because I‚Äôm such a stupid idiot. I thought things were getting better.

And now my little bit of brightness for today is spoiled.

Why am I such an idiot?

I was really excited about this. Now I don‚Äôt even want to think about it. Now it‚Äôs not even about me or my happiness at all. It‚Äôs about my mom, and everything I do wrong to make her so upset all the time.

I knew better. I never raise my voice or talk about myself at home. Why did I do that today?

Later, she came back and made me apologize for yelling (both times) and for making her feel bad.

She grilled me with questions and I had to tell her all the details even though I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. I just wanted to forget the whole thing.

Sharing it with her didn‚Äôt feel the way I thought it would. Somehow, it made my good news feel bad.

Eventually, she was satisfied. She left, and a few minutes later came back with the cat in her arms and a big smile on her face, wanting to hang out.

But I couldn‚Äôt enjoy spending time with her any more, even though she was giving me attention. I just wanted her to leave me alone.

I didn‚Äôt bring it up or say anything. But I must have acted more subdued or something, because she rolled her eyes and sighed and said, ‚ÄúReally? You still can‚Äôt let this go?‚Äù Then left in a huff.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what I say or do now. If I don‚Äôt act perfect - or even if I do - she‚Äôll bring this up forever. And then, ironically, say I‚Äôm the one holding a grudge.

I ruined all the progress we were making. And I acted like a child. And I got overemotional, as always.

Why did I think this would go well?

I‚Äôm such an idiot.

...

Update:

My mom kept bringing it up all day, even after I got over it.

Eventually, I lost my shit.

We got into a really intense screaming match that lasted an hour.

When she was done yelling, she said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done here. Get out.‚Äù

I went back up to my room to wait until she was ready to come upstairs and make me apologize and give her a hug and guilt trip me until I begged for her forgiveness and told her how much I loved her.

I gave up. I lay in bed and started to cry.

I thought about all the times this had happened before.

I thought about all the things I let go to appease her.

I thought about how she was never going to change. That none of this was ever going to change. How unfair it was that I had to just accept this.

But then!!!

I changed my mind.

I thought: *I don‚Äôt accept this anymore.*

It‚Äôs not fair that she can just make me cry whenever she wants. That I have to bend over backwards and walk on eggshells when I already do so much here.

It‚Äôs not fair that she can just take away my happiness whenever she feels like it. Do you know how hard it is for me to find happiness?

Twice in one day. I managed to bring my mood up, to focus on the good, to enjoy life as much as I could.

And twice in one day, as soon as she saw how happy I was, she stuck a pin in my balloon until I deflated.

She didn‚Äôt even ask where I had been when I got home, or what I was doing that had been so much fun. She didn‚Äôt care how my friends were doing. Or how I was.

It‚Äôs not fair that she can do that whenever she wants and still feel self-righteous about how she handles things.

I thought: *I don‚Äôt care if she changes anymore. I just want her to get it.*

So she at least knows what she‚Äôs doing.

If she‚Äôs going to hurt me, I want her to see it so clearly she can‚Äôt deny it.

I thought: *I‚Äôll never be able to accept this if I never even try to change it first. I have to try, at least once.*

I went back downstairs.

I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually not done.‚Äù

And I burst into tears.

I almost never cry in front of my mom. She started off irritated. She rolled her eyes and got that disapproving look on her face.

Voice dripping with bitterness, she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still mad? Really?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bother trying to tell her for the billionth time that I was never mad.

I just asked her: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you even care that you hurt my feelings? All you care about is that it‚Äôs not your fault, even when it is!‚Äù

And we got into another screaming match.

But I kept crying.

It was stupid and pathetic and the dumbest hill to die on, but I didn‚Äôt stop being sad just because she told me to.

I kept crying more with every nasty insult, every dismissal, everything she did to hurt me and make me think I was crazy and do what she wanted.

I kept crying until she could see that she was the one causing the tears.

I let her see how much she hurt me, even though I hated it and felt like the world‚Äôs biggest idiot and just wanted to give up like I always do so it could be over.

But I didn‚Äôt give up today.

It took a long time. I let her yell and scream and berate me until 1am. And I yelled and screamed right back.

But THEN!!!

SHE GOT IT.

...And it only took 19 years.

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what was said. (I was kind of preoccupied.) And I‚Äôm skipping a lot of the details I do remember because they just don‚Äôt need to be on the internet.

But I remember the moment it changed. She leaned against the kitchen counter and put her head in her hands.

And she said, genuinely: ‚ÄúOh my god. Maybe *I‚Äôm* the reactive one!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help it- I laughed.

Then she got this look on her face. I‚Äôll remember it forever.

And she asked me, ‚ÄúHow often do I do this?‚Äù

And I sobbed, ‚ÄúAll the time. My whole life. I can never tell you anything or do anything right.‚Äù

Then she started crying too. And she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

My brain skipped like a scratched record.

I stopped crying.

Then she gave me a hug.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I hurt you.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I started crying again."

I missed out on my chance to win 1,500$

Damn.

Anyways, I was going to go to bed, but decided to write a quick diary entry. I went back and read my diary entries from the 11th and onward. I just can‚Äôt believe how quickly things have resumed with F. Everything is practically normal again. Even normaller than ever. That‚Äôs not even a word ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt give a shit. I just wish he‚Äôd ask me how I‚Äôm doing. How I‚Äôm really doing. Ugh. I need to stop expecting so much from him. He‚Äôs already the best thing to happen to me this year. I‚Äôve learned so much. I‚Äôve grown so much. I feel like I can be an adult now.

Which is only a year and like 20 days away. Woah. Just gave myself a headache trying to imagine me being a legal adult. I‚Äôm a child. I feel like I‚Äôll always be a child. A child who can‚Äôt cope with her emotions. One that‚Äôll never figure life out completely. But I‚Äôm feeling hopeful now. I just watched a video about what sets people out in history. Most of the time it‚Äôs just being in the right place, and not listening to critics. Maybe for me, that means even if that critic is the person whose opinion you value the most.

Maybe I am too obsessed with what F thinks. The photography series I made today really reflects that. I see myself stylistically growing ever closer to his. I can‚Äôt let that happen. I‚Äôve worked so hard at mastering the pen. I will take his advice, but I need to remember that ultimately, for my work to be great, I need to follow my own heart. In life, I need to stay true to myself. I need to choose my own path and stick to it.

Wow, this really turned into a weird rant rather than a log of what happened today. I mean, it was pretty normal. I did wake up early and got to school early to finish the last photograph of my series. I didn‚Äôt really talk to F. I watched the latest GOT episode. Went to some dumb lunch chat in the choir room. The rest was pretty typical. Although after school, I kind of god fed up with H and M and the loud ADD gang. I went into the changing room to work on my drawings. F came in after a bit but just briefly. Eventually they left and I came out to photograph my works. The Latin teacher was talking to him about something or another. I got my stuff all photographed and went to start packing up. We briefly talked about email scammers, and an art show for next year. I hope to god we do something. This would be my last and only chance to display my art how I want. Where I want.

We talked all the way down the hall, he even went out to his car the way I go down the stairs. We talked about it and then suddenly my dad pulled up. I didn‚Äôt even text him. I wish he would wait.

I really feel like I could call F a friend. A teacher / mentor / friend.

Anyways. I hate myself now for not doing that packaging contest. I could have won 1000$ for myself and 500$ for F.

I hope tomorrow will be good."
0,"1.05.19. Progress
Today, like every other day, has been a rollercoaster.

But I‚Äôve always liked rollercoasters.

I am sitting in front of the fireplace, facing the window. Outside, it‚Äôs pouring rain. My cat is curled up on the chair in front of me, taking a nap. My mom is making dinner in the kitchen. She‚Äôs making my favourite food, even though it‚Äôs against the rules of our religion. She‚Äôs making it just for me. I didn‚Äôt even ask - I would never have expected anything like this.

I love the sound of the pouring rain outside, and the crackling of the fireplace, and my cat purring softly to himself, and even the distant sounds of my mom cooking frantically, yelling and dropping things and making a scene like she always does.

Yesterday, I put the kids to bed. I helped them brush their teeth and go to the bathroom and put their PJs on. I listened to their secrets and held them while they cried and eased their tiny, worried minds for that moment. I kissed them goodnight and snuggled them in their beds until their breathing slowed to a calm, even pace.

Later tonight, I‚Äôm taking my brother to a movie he was very upset he couldn‚Äôt see earlier. Avengers Endgame. We‚Äôre both looking forward to it.

Spending time with them like this and getting to take care of them while I still can really helps. It makes me feel like I have some control over their well being. And it makes me feel less hopeless about their futures, even once I leave them behind again.

Today, I‚Äôm in as much pain as I always am (physical and emotional). I‚Äôve spent all day alternating between settling conflicts with my family members and hiding away in isolation to deal with my own woes.

But why spoil this moment by focusing on that?

These days, I take my happiness wherever I can get it. I always feel like I‚Äôm stealing it, like I shouldn‚Äôt really have it. But even if I am a thief of joy, in these moments, I truly don‚Äôt care.

Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm home.

...

Update:

Dinner was terrible. My mom had no idea how to make that kind of food. I loved every bite of it. I even let the cat lick the leftovers off my fingers, which I hate doing because then he bugs me for food forever. But he really loves it when I give him a taste.

I didn‚Äôt get to finish my post the way I wanted to because I got interrupted for dinner. But I just wanted to say that to me, this is what progress feels like.

I managed to keep myself mostly together all day. No weed, no drinking, no crying, no despair. I confronted some of the adults about their behaviour towards the kids and I‚Äôm really hopeful that they‚Äôll change. Not a lot, not enough, but a little. For now, I‚Äôll take any change at all. Baby steps.

I‚Äôm coming to accept that this is just the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. I don‚Äôt know if true peace and happiness even exists. If it does, it doesn‚Äôt for me. At least, not yet.

But something about these stolen moments of joy amidst all the chaos and the darkness makes me treasure them all the more. I don‚Äôt take anything for granted, and I‚Äôm grateful for that. In the end, it‚Äôs really the little things that matter the most.

I know I still have a long way to go before I‚Äôm better. But in moments like this, that I wouldn‚Äôt have even been able to have only a few months ago, I‚Äôm able to see that I‚Äôve come a long way too.

Even when it doesn‚Äôt feel like things will ever get better, now I have proof that they already are.

I‚Äôm making progress.

...

Second update:

The cat is eating leftovers off the table because he thinks no one can see him. I know that dumb bastard is gonna make me regret letting him have a taste of people food. But he‚Äôs really having a great time. Fuck it. Let him eat, he‚Äôs the only one who could possibly enjoy the disaster my mom made, anyways. Plus, he‚Äôs just so cute!

...

Third update:

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a journal entry in the present tense. Usually I write them in the past tense, because I like feeling like it‚Äôs over. But right now I‚Äôm actually not trying to escape being alive. Progress!

...

Fourth update:

Avengers Endgame was AWESOME. Even if it was 3 hours long."
0,"4/30/19 Gotta go fast
Today me and mom went to the buffet and
honestly it was alright but I did eat a lot of food >:)
Now I would like to challenge myself and see if I can fast for a day.
It‚Äôs probably going to be hard but then again I usually eat one meal a day(on weekdays)
Tomorrow where going to get groceries so I‚Äôll pick up some healthy and filling foods.
Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to the doctors i plan on telling her my mood has been going down. I‚Äôve been self harming, feeling more agitated and depressed and honestly I want something to chill me the fuck out.
When I first started my meds some times I would feel so calm and it was great I didn‚Äôt feel on edge like I normally do.:/

Alright, time for another post. Today was good. I went to work despite mechanical problems. I am getting my car looked at tomorrow so fingers crossed whatever happens isn't too expensive. Ugh. I also didn't relapse today but felt like it and had bad thoughts and felt/ feel frustrated with out lack of sex life and Her showing no interest in me like that and getting upset whenever I touch Her. Ugh. We did play a game together for a bit today and that was fun. Let's focus on the good things. I also finished watching Russian Doll today which I liked a lot. The second to last episode is especially good. I need to lose weight but it's so hard. That's all for now. Whole day off tomorrow! I'm pumped."
0,"30.04.19. Today I decided to tell my mom everything.
I was having a bad day.

Just short of being medically considered comatose, I was lying on the couch in the basement. I‚Äôd been there, unmoving, for hours.

As my mind spun endlessly, I thought: *I give up.*

I could no longer find it in me to care about anything - not even my mom‚Äôs reaction to all the secrets I‚Äôd been keeping from her.

Like sticking a pin in a balloon, I immediately felt myself deflate. All the effort and emotion that comes along with the thoughts I‚Äôd been thinking left me.

I knew the relief was temporary; the hot air of overthinking would blow my balloon back up soon if I didn‚Äôt give them the escape vent they were promised.

I‚Äôd thought about coming clean to my parents before, telling them everything and dealing with the fallout and then having this all be over one way or another.

Could be this be it - the end of all the hiding? Just like that, in a single, random, meaningless moment?

I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I could hear my mom walking around upstairs, but I couldn‚Äôt make myself get off the couch. I knew she wasn‚Äôt busy and would come talk to me if I could just get her attention.

So I called her, even though we were no more than fifteen feet apart.

Our phones rang like two hearts beating out of sync.

In between the rings of my own phone in my ear, I could hear my mom‚Äôs ringtone echoing off the walls and down the stairs.

While I waited, I thought about what I would say when she picked up.

I would ask her to come downstairs.

I would ask her for a hug.

And then I would tell her as much as I could.

After that, I had no idea what would happen.

There was a pit in my stomach and a lump in my throat and the hint of tears stinging against the backs of my eyes. I wiped my sweaty palms on my pants and realized that even my hands had gone numb.

Then, after a lifetime but somehow also all too soon, the ringing stopped. My mom‚Äôs voice filled the sudden silence through the phone. Her casual tone was jarring.

Didn‚Äôt she know I was about to destroy her?

I could barely breathe, let alone hear. How was I supposed to talk to her if I couldn‚Äôt even listen? I tried my best to pay attention. I had to do this now or I knew I never would.

I forced my ears to do their job, and managed to pick up the last few words coming through the phone before it would be my turn to speak. I knew I would remember these words forever.

‚Äú...and I‚Äôll get back to you as soon as possible.‚Äù

It was her voicemail.

I didn‚Äôt bother leaving a message."
0,"4/30/19 Doggy nips
I didn‚Äôt go to school today because I didn‚Äôt get much sleep.
My dog Lola has been sleeping with me more often she even follows me to my room. Tonight I heard her make it weird mouth sound so I go and touch her face since it was pitch black in my room. It turns out she was suckling, I knew she was having a good dream so I gave her some rubs.
Boy oh boy do I wish that dogs didn‚Äôt have nipples I mean I can rub my cats tummy without feeling anything and it‚Äôs great for both of us.
But With the dog some times I just notice her nips and I saddens me that I have to touch them to giver her the tummy rubs that she deserves.:(
Why does it trigger me so?!

Today I heard news that my best friend K. went to the hospital from what I heard and put together she mixed her meds, walked out of her Bfs house and went to some neighbors house to call her parents[ which were in the city and she was in a town about an hour and a half away]. She had been having mental breakdowns and talked about me a lot( which was nice to hear i that help her and mean more to her than I thought.) she‚Äôs in the ER and I wish I could see her, I couldn‚Äôt last time.
I told her bf try not to feed her drugs because they trigger her. I know it would mean a lot if I came to see her so I‚Äôll ask her bf if he could pick me up on the way there. If not I‚Äôll have to take the buss across city.

Edit 1: tomorrow I‚Äôll call the general hospital to see if she‚Äôs open for visits. If so I‚Äôll skip my second half class and I guess buss it downtown and walk the rest. Maybe I‚Äôll ask mom for some money to get K. a get well present since it‚Äôs the least I can do.

0,"I don‚Äôt like being alive
I don‚Äôt like being alive.

I tell myself that I do. That I‚Äôm too afraid to kill myself. That I know people care about me and would be sad if I died.

But fuck, being alive is hard.

I try my best to do the right thing. I force myself out of bed every day now, even if it takes me a long time. I make sure to socialize at least once every couple days. I stopped self harming. I go to counselling- I reached out for help all by myself. No one else told me to do that. And I pay for it myself too, not with my parents money. I‚Äôm taking time off from school. I submitted that goddamn appeal for all my failed grades even though I really didn‚Äôt want to. I left home, even though it meant trusting the adults to take care of the kids. I only smoke weed at night, and sometimes not at all. I stopped doing all other drugs altogether. I downloaded a CBT app and used it every day. I even journaled for a while. I stopped starving myself, all on my own, and let myself gain all the weight back and then some. Now I‚Äôm a fat piece of shit, but who cares? As long as I get better. Stopped counting calories. Stopped making excuses. Forced myself to leave the house. Forced myself to leave the house at night. Forced myself to go outside by myself. Forced myself to go back to campus. Forced myself to go to parties. Even forced myself to go on dates for a while, until one of them pulled a fucking knife on me. No one cares. No one even noticed. I did all this work just get back to functioning at the absolute bare minimum like any basic fucking person.

It‚Äôs all SO fucking hard. How do other people do this? I struggled so much and they all just do it, like it‚Äôs nothing. Not that any of the shit I did even mattered in the end. I‚Äôm still completely miserable. Why does nothing help?

I‚Äôm trying. I really am. It‚Äôs all I can do at this point. Even though all this shit is so fucking hard. Some days all I wanna do is get high and lie in bed and ignore everyone and everything. Sometimes it takes literally everything in me not to cut. Sometimes all I can do is curl up and cry. Or just lie there like a corpse - wishful thinking, I guess. Sometimes while I‚Äôm lying there I like to tell myself that everything‚Äôs gonna be ok in the end if I just keep trying.

But I don‚Äôt know if it will. I did everything as right as I know how and shit still fucking sucks.

They say being raped isn‚Äôt your fault. That you can do everything right and still get raped because it‚Äôs rape, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I didn‚Äôt do everything right that night. Far from it. But hearing that still makes me feel hopeless. I can do everything right and it won‚Äôt even matter. I‚Äôll just find out I might have a fucking autoimmune disorder instead, right as I‚Äôm starting to pull myself out of this deep dark depression hole. Or I‚Äôll just find out that things have gotten worse at home. They were getting better, for a while. Or maybe I‚Äôll just have a repressed memory come back of the time I was fucking molested as a kid.

Or who knows? Maybe my shitty, broken brain will act up and I‚Äôll just decide that my entire life is pretend and everything bad that ever happened is a lie I made up to get out of my responsibilities because I‚Äôm such a fucking failure I needed to fake getting gang raped to get out of going to school while demanding sympathy for being so fucking pathetic that I can‚Äôt even do basic fucking functions to take care of myself.

I don‚Äôt even have a job. I was gonna get one, but then I didn‚Äôt. Story of my fucking life. It‚Äôs honestly amazing there‚Äôs still people around who put up with me. It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm lying to them. I‚Äôm lying to everyone. I don‚Äôt even know what the truth is anymore.

Goddammit, I‚Äôm spiralling again.

The stupid fucking CBT app told me to do a breathing exercise if I feel like this. I don‚Äôt even want to breathe!

What a fucking waste of oxygen.

I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself. That would be too selfish. But I fucking HATE being alive and I wish I would just get hit by a fucking bus already. Not that I would be lucky enough to actually die if I got hit by a bus. I‚Äôd probably just lose a leg or get internal bleeding or some shit. How the fuck has none of this shit killed me yet? I don‚Äôt even want to be alive, what a fucking waste of oxygen!

I‚Äôm drinking alone in my locked bathroom right now. I just looked at the time- it‚Äôs exactly midnight. A brand new day. Fucking fantastic.

I hate being a ‚Äútrooper‚Äù. I hate my chronic leg pain and my goddamn maybe-celiac disease and my TWO fucking rapes (or possibly more like 5 or 6. Depends if you count each individual guy as one rape, or if you just group them all into one event. Not that I even know how many guys were there that night. I was fucking blackout shitfaced. Not that it even matters past a certain point how many people rape you. It all blurs together.) and I hate being the oldest of fucking EIGHT younger siblings and cousins I have to be fucking responsible for all the time no matter what of my own shit I have going on and that‚Äôs not even mentioning my shitty, stupid parents and aunts and uncles and older cousins that I also have to support for whatever fucking reason and my fucking learning disability and all my goddamn anxiety and motherfucking PTSD (if I even have that which I didn‚Äôt want to know if I did until my counsellor fucking told me I did when I didn‚Äôt even ask because I didn‚Äôt want to fucking know) and all the other awful thoughts and fucked up twisted mental health problems I probably have and most of all I HATE myself and I hate my stupid fucking life and I wish it would just fucking END already.

What the fuck did I do to deserve this? Is it because I made everything up? Now dealing with the consequences is my punishment.

I don‚Äôt believe in hell. I don‚Äôt need to. This is worse.

I hope I drink myself to death in this bathroom.

With my luck, though? I fucking doubt it. I‚Äôm just so fucking lucky."

I haven‚Äôt written in a while. Things have just been normal. I guess.

I‚Äôve been struggling lately. My self harm is back and as bad as ever. I can‚Äôt stop. I just want to cut all the time. My legs look so bad.

I miss her so bad. I haven‚Äôt told anyone ever.

I pray for the opportunity to talk about it. I just want F to ask me if I‚Äôm doing okay, and I just want to confess how much I miss mom. I don‚Äôt care if he cares. I just feel like he‚Äôs the only one who would care.

I‚Äôve been having a tough weekend. Friday was so awkward. I stayed in the changing room after school doing nothing because I didn‚Äôt wanna interrupt MYM club. Eventually towards the end of their meeting F came in the room and asked what I was doing. I just said I was gonna make a cyanotype but then didn‚Äôt feel like it and didn‚Äôt want to interrupt their meeting. It seemed so awkward. I got up to leave but he said I could wait. I just sat in silence, ashamed. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I‚Äôm ashamed of who I am, how I am.

Eventually I left and I got outside and just started crying. I miss mom so much. So bad.

I cried more Friday night. I cried at work Saturday. I cried and cried and cried Saturday night. I caved in and emailed Grammy about the birds. SIREN IS A MOTHER
SHES LAID 15+ EGGS.

Oh god. I cried during church. Apparently Louie is at some guys place who works for uncle K. He has a whole backyard and everything. I hope he‚Äôs happy.

I miss mom so much. So so so so so so much. Everything reminds me of her. And now I‚Äôm crying again.

I want her back. It‚Äôs not fair. I feel so alone. I wish she was buried, not cremated. I wish I could have a grave to visit and cry over. Now I have to wait for my grandparents to die so I can inherit her ashes and phone etc. It‚Äôs awful to say, but I almost hope they die soon. I want moms memory for myself. She‚Äôs not theirs, never was. I just wanna hold her once more.

I want someone to know how much pain I‚Äôm in. Dad would NEVER understand. No one understands. Maybe F might.

I wish I had the guts to kill myself. But I never will.

I just want mom back. AND HOW DOES ALYSSA EXPECT ME TO RUN BACK TO GOD WHEN THAT MEANS ACCEPTING THAT MY MOTHER IS BURNING IN HELL FOR ETERNITY???

I hate myself. I want to die. But I wish I could die right. I saw endgame tonight. I cried a lot.

I didn‚Äôt write yesterday. Because not much happened. It was a normal Tuesday. Tuesday‚Äôs suck. F wasn‚Äôt there to make it interesting. It‚Äôs like my fam was gone.

But J has been worrying me lately. She‚Äôs made a few very dry suicide jokes and I‚Äôm actually concerned for her. Z‚Äôs death really seems to be getting to her. Even though they weren‚Äôt close, she‚Äôs really feeling the loss. So I texted her last night. I told her I know how lonely death can feel, but that she‚Äôs not alone, blah blah, and that I‚Äôm always here to talk if she needs it. I really do genuinely care for her. She and L have helped me confidence and self-love so much. I don‚Äôt want them to feel down.

I kind of hope she doesn‚Äôt come into the cafeteria this morning to talk. I feel so awkward getting emotional in public, and I really never know the words to say. Whatever. I really hope today is a good day. I‚Äôm getting my hair dyed after art club! Woo hoo. I am so ashamed of my hair. It looks so gross. My roots are like an inch or longer and the color looks like a rusty dirt. Not in a good way!

I hope my clothes arrive soon too. I‚Äôm excited for a fresh appearance. If only I could lose weight haha.

I don‚Äôt know what to wear. My laundry should have been done like three weeks ago. I might just wear my baseball t. It‚Äôs the only one that‚Äôs large and comfy. Maybe I‚Äôll risk shorts again? Who knows. I should get ready now. And find my debit card! Yikes."

However, I know that I got at least two guaranteed A's this semester, another one should be on its way once its grade is posted, and I think my presentation will be good enough to push me over the hump for another A (although that one is a little trickier because there is a number of moving parts with it). I sure do feel pretty lucky tbh. My two known A's I got by the skin of my teeth. I just need to do well on the presentation tomorrow and get at least an 80% on my final on Thursday (still got a lot of studying to do for that though, its no guarantee I'll get that 80). Pretty sure if I get all of them I'll be the only person in my small group that has a 4.0 still. WOOOOO! Can't get too hyped yet though. Still have work to be done. I will study a little more and then get some sleep before waking up and studying again. I can do this!"

Wow I just confronted my mother about my old drug use.
Today she was telling Mike about how I was stealing her weed and how I was smoking it last night, fyi I was coughing because I was choking on water Big bruh.:/
Anyways in the last 15min I told her if she really believed that I stole her weed I also told her not to go behind my make and make accusations because it‚Äôs rude. She said she would keep that in mind and stayed quiet.
I told her how it made me feel anxious and more self aware of our shitty household, so I stopped.
It‚Äôs normally very hard for me to confront people but i knew I‚Äôd have to step up to her and maybe one day I‚Äôll become more confident in myself.

Also my meds have been doing well for me and I hope to find new friends!

Unfortunately I‚Äôm still self harming and I think my moms catching on she keeps looking at my ankle[above region] which is where it primarily happens. I hand washed my socks and I can‚Äôt believe how much blood got soaked up, I couldn‚Äôt tell because it was black.

Peoples extreme self harm looks so bad that it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been burnt, all of the scars have distorted the skin making it unlevel and discoloured. Honestly it‚Äôs disgusting and horrible."

I‚Äôve been so lost. So corrupt. So wicked, evil, impure. I obsess over a sinner, and disregard God like He‚Äôs nothing.

All I‚Äôve done for the majority of the school year is obsess about F. Every action, decision, thing I make/say, is all for him ‚Äî or to be like him. Sure.. he‚Äôs great. But he‚Äôs not been great for me. He‚Äôs an idol. Art has become my idol. My obsession. I have no time/interest for God when the focus of my life is art. I‚Äôm so weak, and lose my faith so easily. I feel so guilty before Him. What have I done? You foolish, foolish sinner, you.

I talked with Alyssa today. She knows me too well. I can‚Äôt hide my unbelief from her. She knows. The way I go on and on about art... she knows how much of an idol it is to me. How could I be so foolish? I prayed this afternoon. I truly prayed for the first time in almost a year. I asked God to give me my desire back. I repented for being so disobedient. I asked him to take away my obsession with F, and turn it towards Him.

At the end of the day, F is only a teacher/mentor. But God.. the creator. The one who, by his mercy, saved me. Saved me from damnation, from eternal fire, to live with him forevermore for all of eternity when I die, or when he returns. The one who‚Äôs always looked out for me. The one who‚Äôs been so gracious when I ran from him. The one who holds out his open arms while I ran to a sinners. I thought I could save myself. I thought I could figure everything out by myself. Even if that were true, what of death? Oh what a miserable life without Christ. I need no longer worry when I put my trust in Him. He‚Äôs always been there for me.

I want my heart to change. Lord change me. With each passing second my mind wanders back to the fleeting things of this world. Keep me heaven bound.

My baptism was not worthless. I just fell away.

But. Today was ok.

Nothing exciting happened. I gave F his deckled edge ripper. He loved it. My prints made with the ferric chloride didn‚Äôt really work. The lines were very blurry. F asked Rub about it. Apparently that‚Äôs normal for a soft ground. I‚Äôve kinda lost hope. I‚Äôm so lost right now. I really need some direction."

So im am just going to type my thoughts and daily routines down here. It's the only place that i think is safe
I don't trust Facebook, whisper, twitter or google no more
And it not like i could write anything down my aunt would just find it and i don't need that.
I will not say my real name unless i see it is fit to tell it but only to those i truly trust if that may happen which i doubt it but i will let you know a few little details about me
I take care of an old man that is not blood-related to me
His wife goes to work a few days out of the week at night anf doesn't return till early morning. I have  the house to myself
I do not let people come over or go out once she leaves
All windows and doors are sealed right.
I keep a schedule during the day when the wife is home i tend to stay to myself not talking much to her an hour or 2 is the most i see here after work than she is off to bed,
The old man isn't much to deal with.  Unless he wishes to go outside

I don't see too many people around here, i don't go outside unless i have to and i avoid. Going into town
This is all i can type for now a part  2 might be coming later on

In Middle School, I used to cry myself to sleep, When I brought it up to family they'd tell you ""Stop being so dramatic"", so you bring it up to you're friends but then again it's a competition of whose life sucks the most. Invalidating. So you sit silently hurting. Silently crying, so no one else knows or even comments. Now I don't cry-I feel as I've finally ""sucked it up"". I'm finally 'normal' so used to the emotionless, dry, anxiety I set in a bed of darkness with an emotionless facial expression. I never thought I'd be so comfortable.

&#x200B;

Then you come with your jackhammer, Chiseling every wall I've ever built the ""Wall of Shame"". My Berlin madness captivating my emotions from defecting west.

Let me take you back to High School. My five best friends and I shared one notebook. The rules were:

&#x200B;

1. We had to be honest about EVERYTHING

2. We need to write real emotions

3. Nothing leaves the notebook and it's a judgment-free zone( Until now)

4. When we saw each other we had to pass the notebook off with a new entry

&#x200B;

By doing this we became closer more respectful and connected in unbelievable ways. You can write about ANYTHING, EVERYTHING, and DRAW. Nothing is off limits and you're going to hear our story here ( rule #3). I've already let them know, and we are ready to open you up to our lives to you.

Today was a bad day overall. Mainly because I only studied for a very little bit but have big projects and exams coming this week that I am not ready for. My plan is to wake up early tomorrow and start working my butt off to try and get prepared for the week. It will just be a few intense days of working and then I can chill for a bit come Thursday night and into Sunday. I had some anxiety today. Mostly over feeling frustrated about our complete lack of sex life and Her lack of interest in me in that way. I know it's difficult for Her with what I've done in the past but I still feel like She should be interested sometimes. Idk. It's been making me feel really negative about our relationship lately and I am not sure what to do about it. We ate Easter dinner with my family which was pretty good. Alright, that's all for now I would say. Time to hit the hay and get to work early."

My cuts are this beautiful bruised purple color. I wish I could post a pic. There‚Äôs some horrific beauty to them unlike any I‚Äôve seen before. I want to cut the scab off and watch them bleed again. Ugh, that‚Äôs so disturbing.

Work was GREAT. I forget how much I love my job and the people there. I wouldn‚Äôt trade it at all right now. I feel bad about dissing work. They‚Äôre like a second family sometimes.

Today was fun. I planted some plants. Now I‚Äôm gonna shower and do some laundry. I hope to draw tomorrow. That is my biggest goal.

I'll be done with my semester really soon and I am pretty excited. idk why though, it just means ill be working more which isn't much better. blegh. Alright, that's all for now.

Woke up nice and rested. I checked my phone. F Facebook invited me to a T-shirt printing thing at Odd. It looks interesting. But I was just so thrilled he thought I‚Äôd be interested. I was screaming in the inside. I doubt I‚Äôll go. But it seems cool.

I went to ace and bought some seeds and dirt. I‚Äôm determined to get it right. I told Auggie on my story that I‚Äôd figure it out. While I was down at the mart, I had McD‚Äôs and met Zoe at Starbucks. I told her how excited I was for her to be in high school. Gosh, I‚Äôm just excited about everything. About art, about summer, about camp, about Zoe. Things are gonna be great. Life is great. Jeez, I‚Äôm so bipolar.

Yet I got home. Took out my blade and cut my leg pretty deep. They bled down my leg. And dripped onto my nice sock. They‚Äôre all purple now. These are gonna leave nasty scars. I don‚Äôt know why I do it. It doesn‚Äôt really hurt to do. It‚Äôs not a pain thing for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just broken. My brain isn‚Äôt wired right or something. I wish I‚Äôd find something better to do that cut myself next time.

Work was ok. Church was okay. It was Good Friday. When we got home we all talked about dreams, and eventually talked about memories from when we were kids. God. I miss being a kid. I really do. But I‚Äôve also realized I haven‚Äôt changed a bit. I‚Äôm still goofy af. And my sister is still a little diva. But I love it.

The only thing missing is mom.

I‚Äôm too tired to cry. I‚Äôm gonna sleep now. It‚Äôs midnight. Tomorrow I need to plant my plants, and take a pic of my camera shirt."
0,"Crazyness inside my head
This all happened within a 24hour period
This is my clusterfucked mind, I know it's all.over the place, but I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on in my brain.

We were having a regular night in Cuba, saxophoniste playing for people in the lobby, everyone seemed into it but barely any dancing, other than the synchronized dancers. I met a Anne-Marie and her aunt, Sylvie, Anne-Marie had a come hither look that made me feel alive, however being the shy person that I am, and figuring she was way out of my league, I decided to smile and let her flirt. I flirted back a bit, she was drunk and she was there to party. She tries to get me to dance a few times but I was unwilling as my alcohol intake hadn't reached the ""I don't give a fuck"" level. And in all honesty, the place was cracking with people. Anne-Marie kept dancing and drinking, her aunt seemed worried. She kept saying let's live life like it's our last night on earth, to which I finally understood, through an acquaintance she met and introduced me to, and through her own verbiage through out the night, she wanted to die. Now I've been through this with an ex that I loved dearly, and it's not something I take lightly, I tried to talk with her, but she wanted to keep partying and drinking, inviting pretty much everyone around her to dance, which to my surprise, did not work out in her favor. I keep telling myself, if I was in better shape and not as shy, I probably would have been all over that like fat kid (me) on cake. But the emotional distress she was in was worrysome. I was able to talk to her before leaving, mentioning that I'd like to carry on our conversation during the day tomorrow, hoping that I will catch her in a sober moment. I mentioned to her not to be shy, I'm not judging you and I really want to have a chat with you tomorrow. I really hope she does come over and say hi, she legitimately seems like an awesome person going through a bad time. I may not be the one that pulls her out of the water, but I'm hoping I can be a help to her somewhere along her journey, however hard it may be. After having one last drink on the second lobby and hoping to see her pass by, I went to bed hoping that someone doesn't take advantage of her, and that her aunt will be there for her if something we're to happen. Maybe I should have stuck around longer? To what end?, I can only help, and she won't necessarily listen to a guy she just met, or would she ?

I went to bed worried, hoping that the best in people would shine for another night.


Part 2, morning of April 19th (p1/p?)

I didn't think I had seen Anne Marie and her aunt during our stay even though they arrive before us, however crossing them at the restaurant reminded me that we had crossed paths. My mother greeted them and I waved hello, but I was mostly ignored, or so I felt. I had mixed feelings about this feeling of being ignored, I had really tried to help her the night before, as much as I could at least, I don't know if she's embarrassed or if she doesn't remember, maybe we will cross paths again tonight and we will know for sure, if she's not as wasted as last night that is...

P2/P?
Further during our morning of reading on the beach whilst listening to the waves crashing on the beach, I found myself thinking that this was the first time in a long time that someone had flirted with me and reciprocating. I am sometimes oblivious to women flirting but I'm pretty sure this is the first time in a long time. It made me feel good, even though I could tell it was just drunken flirting that in a normal setting, she likely would not have looked at me twice, I know it sounds like I'm being hard on myself, but history hasn't proved me wrong. I'm feeling a bit touchy feely this morning, I guess this started when I got to the resort and seeing multiple couples look like they are having the grandest of times and that love is flowing everywhere  I'm starting slowly to be jealous about this, it's been a good 4 years since my ex came home and told me she didn't love me anymore, thinking about it still is like a stab through my heart as it was the hardest thing I've ever been through to this day. What happened last night reminded me of how it was nice to be with someome even though I wear this big armor right now and claim that I'm better off alone. The jealousy is probably what got me to uninstall Facebook, everyone's life is so beautiful and fake, probably like some of the couple's here who are just enjoying there time.because it's vacation?  I don't know, all I know is I feel like crap today, and maybe I should have seen a therapist a few years ago, that I always put off because I'm ""OK"". I'm full of shit is what that is...


Whilst taking my shower I was thinking and wanted to add a small part to my last entry, this girl might be the one that turns this all around for me, she made me realise that I miss taking care of someone else other than myself. I've always wanted kids and was not sure where to go with this after my ex left, I see so many kids that only see there dad 4 days a month, my feelings inside me when I think about if I was in that situation, break my heart. I have more quality time with my friends kid then her own father has, for some time I figured that would be sufficient for me, take care of other people's kids. I think this whole ordeal has lit a fire back in me I thought was gone... Maybe I'm blowing everything out of proportion...maybe not..."

Oh my god it‚Äôs already the 18th. Jeez. Only a month left of school. Ughhhh. I‚Äôve got so much to do. Not enough time. Time to kick it into gear.

Today was great. Wholesome even. Started out with a stupid math quiz. Then the lamest pep assembly in the world. I sat with Alex. Mrs. SB got teacher of the year. She totally deserves it.

I came in to F‚Äôs room during lunch to work on painting my screen with the screen filler. He took his drawing class outside or something to draw. I was alone for a while. River texted me asking where I was so I told her to come to F‚Äôs room. We talked and stuff. Then I got the sudden urge to write an inspirational quote on the board. So I did. She drew a little dragon. Then all of a sudden the bell rang. I looked at my phone. It was 11:45. That was the bell to be back in class. Shittttt I thought. Then I told River I‚Äôd make up a pass for myself. I looked around for a piece of paper, then I found F‚Äôs pad of passes on his desk and took one. I didn‚Äôt know his signature off the top of my head obviously. Then I had the bright idea to use an old seminar pass. I spent a minute or two looking around the class and in the trash for one, then I remembered there‚Äôs one probably stuffed in my bag. Eventually I found it and I forged his signature. River was kind of surprised, but not shocked. I‚Äôm a goody two shoes, I‚Äôll admit. But I‚Äôm like lawful neutral. I don‚Äôt want to be late to class, so I‚Äôll steal a pass and forge a signature. Haha whatever. Anyways, I made it to class and Mrs. SB accepted my pass. All was well. We watched like most of the Great Gatsby. The new one. WHICH WE DID LIKE A MONTH AGO IN HISTORY. Ughhh. Whatever, at least it‚Äôs entertainment.

So then came 6th hour. My critique was first. It was weird. Everyone else just started talking without F even really being there. Looking at my work as a whole, I was embarrassed. It really didn‚Äôt look that good. My cyanotypes were bad. Everything sucked. F didn‚Äôt really take part because he was busy with something on his computer. I don‚Äôt have the faintest idea what I‚Äôll do for my next project. Then we moved on to other people‚Äôs stuff. I had a lot better things to say today for sure. I made a smart comment on Liza‚Äôs photos that I think impressed F. At least I hope so. After that I just sat around and watched Lily work on the computer with illustrator.

Then the bell rang, and I asked F if I could print some t-shirts. He said he didn‚Äôt have any but I said I went to Savers last night and picked up a few. I printed my shirts. The first one turned out awful. So did the second, but by the third, I thought we had a good strategy down. He commented on how communal screen printing is as an activity. The ink started to dry in the holes where the ink came out earlier, which made for a better print.

Eventually everyone left. I got all my shirts printed, cleaned my screen, got my stuff packed. And was ready to leave, when he mentioned he was staying later today because he didn‚Äôt have to pick up his son. I talked with Alex and F about kids and how rebellious they are at the middle school age. We also talked about my art camp stuff. He asked if I got it all figured out. I told him how excited I was. He said he hopes R is my instructor when I‚Äôm there this summer. He didn‚Äôt realize that I got to stay on campus and stuff when I was there. I‚Äôm really excited to use a professional studio with proper equipment when I‚Äôm there. Maybe it‚Äôll be a chance for me to print some copper plates I‚Äôll etch during June. Or not. Who knows!

Oh gosh, I can‚Äôt even remember what we talked about. But things were good. He asked if I had any t-shirts his size, and I said yeah, I made for this one for him. He said he loved it. I hope it fits him. He wanted the XL and not the larger one. But it‚Äôs okay, I like oversized t-shirts anyways. Plus I tried it on at home and it looked cute on me. I also tried etching my test plate from the other week for another 15 minutes or so. I washed it off and it worked! It really worked! Next I‚Äôll make a test strip so I can figure out how long I need to etch for the best printing results. F said I should get a large plate at the store and draw onto that. I told him that was my goal. I‚Äôm so excited for the whole world of possibilities this opens up.

I think things are normal again. Exactly a week now, and it‚Äôs like it never happened. And I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm having a great day today.

It was like 4:30 before I left. Dad had to wait in the car for me because I forgot to text him and tell him I was staying late. On the way out we briefly talked about work and my job and raises and stuff. He said I should ask for a raise if I was told I‚Äôd get one and if I am doing a higher level job now. I agree with him. I just don‚Äôt want the trouble. I already hate initiating conversations, and one about a raise for me would be so awkward.

When I got home I posted a pic of me in my new cool shirt on my story, mentioning that I‚Äôd sell some. F replied later and said that it was a great idea. He said he loved his shirt, and that the mushroom one I made the other day would sell really well too. I told him I didn‚Äôt really love the mushroom one. That I‚Äôd make new, better ones soon. I thanked him for helping me so much with this screen printing stuff.

I ate some hot pockets for dinner. Then later I went on a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and went to price chopper. I grabbed some hair ties and stuff, and some reces pieces and granola bars and a grape zevia. I watched Glass, and the Green Book tonight. Both were good. Glass didn‚Äôt really feel like a sequel to split. I didn‚Äôt think Split needed a sequel if I‚Äôll be honest. Anyways, I‚Äôm having a great day. And I‚Äôm totally exhausted and going to go to sleep.

Hopefully tomorrow I‚Äôll be in an art making mood. I need to get shit done!"

I been having a headache for the last two days. I have not taken any medicine for it. i believe it has something to do with me not taking my antidepressants. it been two weeks since i stopped and so far the hell has just begun. my doctor wants me to make an appointment but i don't have time since my boss is retarded and wants to work me 6 days a week. hopefully the withdrawal ends and i can feel better.

I have a new co-worker with the same name as my dad and we seemed to hit it off well. when i first laid eyes on him, i was drooling. he is tal, thick and masculine with a nice ass. sad part is that he is not gay but i been fantasizing about him being mine. i already added him on Snapchat and Facebook. once i get his phone number, maybe we can text more. he is extroverted and a talker but i feel like me and him cant relate since we are polor opposites.

I been working back to back and yesterday was my only off day. im liking im getting so many hours but i value my off day. maybe i shouldn't complain because i can easily go back to getting 12 hours a week. I just hate my job and need time to breathe.

i keep spending money from my savings to my off my credit card. im not being responsible with my spending. im going backwards and i hate it. my impulsive ways is fucking me up.

It‚Äôs like nothing ever happened. And I don‚Äôt know if I like it. But I‚Äôm sure a lot happier. That‚Äôs a good thing. Maybe I can escape from this without dad finding out after all.

The weirdest thing happened this morning, Gabe came and sat down with me in the cafeteria. We just chatted about school. I was kinda nervous and trying to sound cool. I kinda like Gabe.. always have. He‚Äôs always been cute. Even before he lost weight. We have a lot of common ground too. I wish we were better friends. I should DM him a meme again soon. Note to self.

But yeah, today was pretty easy. Just watched Brooklyn 99 through 5th hour. In 3rd hr, Mrs. H said I had to go take some state assessment for science. Lilah ended up being in the same room as me. We talked for a bit. We both decided that we were going to quit FL this year. I‚Äôm glad we both agree on that.

Lunch was alright. Raegan has started noticing my earrings like every single day. I feel proud of that ngl.

7th hr was a drag. I was in too much of a good mood to play anxious. I was actually feeling great. I felt more comfortable talking around/to F. After critiques, and when class was over, I asked for some help with paying my camp deposit. There was a glitch with the website. He suggested I just email them. I did. I still can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôm literally so excited. This is going to be one of the most fun things ever.

So after that I asked if I could mess with the screen drawing fluid and stuff. He handed me a bottle of some dark red liquid. I sat down with my screen and a paintbrush and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. F jokes around and said I should put ‚Äú(ME) RULES‚Äù and then I can run around screen printing it on people and walls and stuff. Obviously that‚Äôs not how it works but it was funny af. But then I said really, what should I do? He said I should paint the camera sitting on the table. I said sure, and I warned him I sucked at painting.

The table behind me was having some interesting conversations. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh and look at F. I‚Äôm really glad he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm annoying. I feel really special and appreciated. I can‚Äôt wait for my deckled edge ripper gift to arrive. He‚Äôs gonna love it! Anyways, I finished my camera drawing and it looked pretty good for being drawn directly on the screen from a paintbrush and no drawing. Then when he was watching a video on how to do this process, he realized I was using the wrong material to paint on the screen. I was using the screen filler not the drawing fluid. Ughhh. So I just made an outline around it and started filling in the rest of the screen with a broader brush. I figured I‚Äôd just print with white ink on a dark shirt. I only got around halfway done filling in the screen when F had to leave. I cleaned up my brushes and asked if I could come in early tomorrow. He said sure, but then I realized that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to because of teacher meetings. Then he said I could do seminar, but I remembered we had a pep assembly. That started a mini conversation on pep assembly‚Äôs. Then I just said I‚Äôd come in during lunch. He told me I was welcome anytime any hour. And I left.

He didn‚Äôt once bring up my email or anything. I think he just forgot, but I was totally okay with not talking about it. I wish he‚Äôd just say one last thing. Just so I know what he‚Äôs thinking. But things are going so well I don‚Äôt want to ruin it.

He waved to me when he passed me on the stairs outside. Everything is going back to normal. Finally. Exactly a week and everything‚Äôs pretty much okay. So we went to Savers after dropping my stuff off at home. I got a few black shirts, and one for F. The guy who cashed me out was really nice and said I‚Äôd make a great employee there. He was actually super nice and I wrote a good review of him on the survey thing on my receipt.

Went to church. Shopped around on H&M. I really wanna order some clothes. They just scream me. I‚Äôm so pumped. It started raining a lot at home. Some big thunderstorms went through. Picked up my room a bit. Cut my bangs. Took a shower. Braided my hair so it will be wavy tomorrow. Then I went outside to the garage and sat in the back of the trunk and watched the storm while snacking on some leftover strawberry frosting. It‚Äôs still raining now. The thunder and lighting are crazy. I opened my window a bit so I could hear the rain. Hopefully the cars won‚Äôt be too loud when I sleep. Also I am trying to take advantage of my Spotify premium and listen to as much music as possible.

I think tomorrow will be normal. I have an excuse to stay after now... HELL YEAH. T-shirt printing! But I am not looking forward to critiques.

I can‚Äôt believe things are going back to normal. Thank god."

Today was a decent day I suppose. I didn't relapse, had some anxiety a bit which happens. I had an exam that I think went pretty well. I needed to get 100% to get an A in the class and I am not sure if I did but I might be possible. I did feel anxious about random people today but that's a part of being me. I don't have to work tomorrow which is awesome. That means I only work Saturday this weekend which will give me a lot of time to prepare for final exams. Alright, that's all for now.

0,"Whoops! I did it again
 Houston, we have a problem. A BIG one. So big that if it's not addressed, I see myself filing for E.I. yet again, if I don't go Batshit first.
I've always had difficulty dealing with Obsessive Compulsive personalities. I don't know why, but their apparent high stress/energy just rubs me the wrong way & raises my anxiety, which then gets me angry.
It happened at \*BIFF!\*,  & now it's happening again here.
There has always been tension between me & this customer, right from the get-go. From the very moment I even saw his face I felt anxious. I hated him almost instantly.
Thankfully, I don't have to deal with him every day, but when I do, it always raises my anxiety.
So, yesterday I see he posts a question to which I thought I might have an answer.
I should have known better than to even respond, just by his 4-page question alone.
But, I bite & would live to regret it.
Sure enough, he responds. Naturally, I didn't solve his query, so he further delves into his bizarre little tirade.
I decide to break off at this point, but too late.
I've already granted him an audience & that was all he needed.
I didn't respond in 30 seconds to his response, so he calls me, knowing our cell is complete shit. As soon as I hear his voice, I recognize him from our previous encounters & I can feel my blood pressure rising. He continues on in a demanding & (what I thought to be anyway) very condescending tone. Now, I HAVE to withdraw as I can feel my Anxiety rising. Fuck, I don't need this shit!
I try to end the call, but of course, he calls right back. INSTANTLY I block his number. Now the game is on. I thought I had won, but no.
Sure enough, he comes downstairs & as soon as I see his ugly fucking \*BIFF!\* face I wanna KILL this guy. The breaking point was where he tells me, not asks, TELLS me I need to do...
Lose it.
I try with my last bit of self-control to tell him politely he can do this task himself. I REALLY wanted to tell him to fuck the hell off & get off my ass & get a fucking life. But I refrained from doing so, but my feelings could not be stopped. I punched a small hole in the wall, to which he immediately looked stunned. It was too late. He had crossed the line. And as he walked away I SHOUTED: I FUCKING HATE \*BIFF!\*
INSTANTLY I felt weak. You know that feeling right after a fight when you start coming down from the Endorphin rush? ThAT'S pretty much how I felt.
For the 3rd time in less than 4 months, I had lost it again. And not only lost it, but to the extreme. One thing about me, I never do anything half measure.
But the damage was done. I had fucked up & fucked up ROYALLY yet again. I had to get out of there. Just get away. NOW.
I limped away & hid in a nearby hallway where I could be secluded. I didn't want to see ANYBODY. I was in full licking my wounds mode.
I called my Wife. Of course, she was away from her phone, so I had no help there.
I called 21 times to at least leave her the impression that I needed to speak to her immediately.
I felt sick to my stomach. THIS time, I REALLY did it. I turned off my Work Phone as I just couldn't deal with anybody right now. Thankfully, it was close enough to lunch so I skulked upstairs to the Lunchroom where I fully absorbed the enormity of what I had just done. I needed help. As much as I didn't want to deal with people right now, I wanted to talk to my wife. Failing that, I even tried the (what I THOUGHT was)Crisis line & of course, got some school my mistake.
Finally, my wife becomes available & I unload my latest burden on her because with everything else going on for her, she really needs to deal with my shit too.
I HATE that I can't be the strong one. that I'm weak & need to dump my problems on someone. I hate the sense of loss of control. I hate having to need someone. To need ANYBODY.
But I DID need my wife now & I burdened her.
We both agreed I should take an extended lunch at LEAST, to which I did.
Althewhile dreading what would be awaiting me once I returned. The Asshole? With my Manager perhaps? My Boss? All this anxiety I caused simply because I can't get along with someone. FUCK, but I HATE who I am sometimes. A pathetic, WEAK little pussy who is scared of everything & everybody. It's a miracle I can even hold a job for even more than 2 weeks.
I remember way back when I was a Teenager & I had a meeting with a Shrink. Even back then he predicted I would never be able to hold a job. That I would forever wander from job to job & fuck if he wasn't right! HOW did this person write my entire life's script way back when I was only 15 years old? how the HELL did he know what would happen? How I would turn out?
I just don't understand...
But back to today. It was 5 past 2 pm. I couldn't put it off any longer. I collected myself as best I¬†could & still with my phone off, I headed back downstairs. Nobody. Nobody was there. thank GOD.                                                                            Of course, there was a shitload of \*BIFF!\*, but this was a GOOD thing in this instance as it could provide a legitimate reason for me to dismiss \*BIFF!\* if he came calling again.
I happily lent myself to the distraction of my task & before I knew it, it was 4pm.
Hell, \*BIFF!\* even managed to show up on time!
Maybe. Just maybe I might be able to get out of here today without any further grief.
I managed to do just that & even when I got home, not a single call, email or text.
Now today, 24 hrs. later, not a thing has been mentioned. Not to me, at least.
I may indeed have dodged a bullet at work, yet AGAIN, but the underlying problem remains.                                                    I have issues that need to be addressed & they need addressing NOW if I am to ever hold a job."

Alright, had a bit of a big day. Got an assignment back and I didn't like the grade that I got on it. There is one thing that literally nobody in the class did that was expected of us so we all got points off. I feel that if literally no one included it then it wasn't made clear enough/taught to us that is was necessary to include. I think it's a bunch of bull. I also relapsed today which sucks. I have had a pretty good day academically though. I am worried about tomorrow. I have a bit exam that I need to do really well on to get an A and it's freaking me out. I think I need close to 100% to get an A and that just doesn't seem all that doable. Well, I studied a bit yesterday, a lot today, and will study more tomorrow. All I can do is hope for the best. After that I have two more papers to write this week and then I get to start studying and creating my final projects. Woohoo. Ugh. Tomorrow will be one week away from the last day of exams. Whew. What a dumb semester it's been. Hoping to keep the 4.0 in tact but I'm not holding my breath."

Well, so much build up for nothing. Everything works out in the end. It always does. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm not able to see that when I‚Äôm going through crap.

I felt really nervous sitting in the cafeteria this morning. F did not reply to my email last night, although there was not much to reply to. I felt nervous that he was only just reading it this morning. I started watching Brooklyn 99. It‚Äôs pretty funny. I‚Äôm glad Spotify comes with Hulu now, even though Hulu has ads.

Then during fourth hour. I convinced myself I probably wasn‚Äôt going to talk to the social worker. She hasn‚Äôt sent me a pass, and I just haven‚Äôt heard anything. But my pride got ahead of me and I got a pass during English. My heart stopped for a second. I tried to play it cool without freaking out. I mean, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen immediately? I started to realize my previous thoughts were kind of wrong. I got super anxious and antsy. I‚Äôve been on edgy all week and just can‚Äôt stop picking at my skin or bouncing my leg.

I didn‚Äôt talk to the social worker much. I didn‚Äôt really want to talk to her. I think she realized that. She said she just wanted to let me know that she was here, and there are resources available if I need them. She said Mr. F probably knows what‚Äôs going on better than she does. She asked if things were going okay with school. She asked what I usually did when I got stressed out with school. She basically gave me the answers. I knew where she was trying to go with that question. I wouldn‚Äôt let her in. I wasn‚Äôt in there but 10 mins. She gave me her card. It was so awkward, and I was relieved. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs even going to talk to me again after this.

I think that this issue might almost be over. Already.

I was super nervous about critiques during 6th hour, but we didn‚Äôt end up doing them because F needed to talk to IB/AP kids about exams. I was really on edge all hour. I didn‚Äôt start to loosen up till after the bell rang. I needed to ask him if I should turn in my 20 pieces today or not. It took me a minute because a bunch of other people were asking him stuff. After I put away my pieces, he asked if I was staying after school today. I said not for long, I had to get to work. He said he was just gonna test print a shirt real quick but if I had to leave then I should. I told him I could stay for like 25 more mins. The room was empty for like one minute while he was getting the stuff out. He said that he got my email. I told him I was sorry it was so long, he said it was totally fine. He asked if I had gotten a pass from the social worker yet. I said yeah. He asked if I talked to her today. I said yeah, kinda. Then Claire came out of the dark room and we didn‚Äôt talk about it. I helped him print the shirt. We talked a tiny bit. It felt like things could be normal again. But I could tell he wanted to tell me something more. This incident hasn‚Äôt yet been completely buried. He left to go do something or another and I left because I needed dad to pick me up so I could get home in time to change for work.

When I got home I messaged him asking about art club stuff for tomorrow. He said we could try something I asked him about. And he said ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll talk more tomorrow.‚Äù I think in reference to what happened. I said we should brainstorm stuff for next year soon. And I apologized for not being on top of things lately regarding art club, and stuff in general. He said it was okay. That art club was probably pretty much done for this year and we can just use the time to try some fun stuff out. I told him I was glad he felt the same way about it as I did. And thanked him.

I was really glad I messaged him. I feel a lot more confident now. I just want things to go back to normal. But I just need to know what‚Äôs going on inside his head about what happened. Then I can rest easy.

It was school night at work. But it was worse because it was my old elementary school. I didn‚Äôt know anyone, but still. People can be such high maintenance. When I got home, my new magazine was there. I read most of it, and ate dinner. Oh! Also, I stepped on the scale and I‚Äôm down to 221! I think I can make it to the teens soon! I‚Äôve lost 14 pounds so far! Holy crap! All this worrying has made me not want to eat. Maybe I should be this anxious all the time and get skinny. Lmao.

Tomorrow will be a better day. Things are going to be okay now."

Time for another post. I relapsed today which sucks but I am trying not to worry about it. I told Her about and She didn't seem to get that upset. She did seem to get upset with me a little bit just now because She feels that I think that She doesn't do enough around the apartment but that's just not true and Idk where it came from to be honest. I have to study some more tomorrow morning. I have a big final exam tomorrow that has a whole lot of bullshit content on it. Work was fine today, I also learned that I don't have to work on Friday which will give me more time to prep for my finals (so close to being done!). Alright, that's all for now."

I‚Äôm a bit confused. Never got called to the counselors office once today. Not a word from F either of course. But he said he wouldn‚Äôt bring it up either.

By the time 5th hour rolled around, I was pretty chill. I wasn‚Äôt very anxious at all. I thought I was gonna be sick for a while in first hour, but I got over it. I was starving by the time it was lunch. But I didn‚Äôt feel like eating a full one.

We just critiqued during class today. It was okay for the first two, but after that it was an absolute drag. He tried to make everyone talk once. Even me. He‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWhat do you think (me)?‚Äù I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI dunno, the colors look nice.‚Äù And I‚Äôd say the same thing for just about each one. By the time zine club rolled around I was super super anxious. I noticed I was picking and scratching at my arm and hand a ton. I couldn‚Äôt stop moving or touching my face. It was bad. I wasn‚Äôt a complete wreck, but I was not normal. I think F noticed, but not really.

I was still shocked I never got called down to the counselors. Maybe F really did have my back. But I think he wants me to go talk to her. But he hasn‚Äôt said anything since I messaged him Friday. River spent the whole meeting drawing a portrait of Logan for a log appreciation zine. Then as we were about to leave, J and Grace came in with two people and were talking about filming some movie documentary thing about anxiety and depression. I almost laughed at how ironic it was. F looked really frustrated because he had to leave to go pick up his son but these people were here. He ended up just saying I gotta go, I‚Äôll come back later, I have to anyways for some health thing I‚Äôve gotta be here for tonight. And then he took off down the hallway. I never got to talk to him. Of course. I thought there for a moment I should sit outside on the steps and not text dad until he‚Äôs already come back. But I went to go outside and dad was already there. So I texted him and told him we were working late today. So he went to go pick up my sister and then came back around 4:30. I thought for a moment of waiting around to talk to Fink inside about what I needed to say. But then after a while I realized I just did NOT have the courage. And I‚Äôd screw things up. I realized then I could email him explaining everything and use that as my excuse.

So I went home. Spent like 2 hours writing and proofreading and rewriting an email to him. It was 6:40 before I actually sent it. I don‚Äôt expect him to email back really. It was long and weird. Well, I might as well paste it here.

‚ÄúI wasn't sure whether emailing, or messaging you through group me would be more appropriate for this, but since this was longer I figured email would be better. (I'm really sorry if that was a bad assumption!)

I wanted to get some things off my chest regarding what happened Thursday, but I never ended up getting a chance. I tried to stick around after school today but I just got too nervous and I know how busy you are, so I feel just terrible taking up so much of your time. I get really anxious about initiating conversations, and no matter how hard I try, I've never been able to fully express what I mean to say verbally. My mouth always chooses the wrong words, and I always end up saying something weird I didn't intend on. Anyways, I really did mean to tell you this in person, not some email. I just have not been able sleep well, or stop consistently thinking about what happened Thursday, and how I never really cleared things up.

I just want you to know that I've been pretty much clean from doing that type of thing for months now. I'm really embarrassed it was you who had to find out. I look up to you a lot, and I really don't want some stupid thing I've struggled with to be what defines me. I know you probably don't think that, but I'm just afraid. What you saw was just a small relapse. School stress, and some dreams I had just really hit me hard last week. But that was just a fluke, I really have been able to quit. I only wore shorts last week because I was feeling a lot more comfortable, and I was 100% sure that they completely covered both my legs. They were fine through two family dinners, school, car rides, even the orthodontist. I was stupid and just flat out forgot because I was having such a good day and enjoying the nice weather. I believe I can honestly say that art, you and your classes, and having great friends around got me out of a really dark place I was in. And I'll always be forever grateful for that. I've been doing so much better lately, I'm still going through some stuff, but I don't rely on self harm to deal with my problems anymore.

Thats why I really don't want the counselors/social worker talking to my dad/step mom. I just feel like there is no real need to. I'm 16, and I feel like school has no right to break confidentiality for a resolved issue such as this. This was in the past, and I was proud of being able to get over it without really anyone finding out until now. I know I complain about my dad too much, and I know he cares for me, he just can be totally ignorant though. We were in the car today with my sister and somehow unrelated, they got on the subject of school counselors. My sister asked about what they even do besides your schedule, and my dad just said they deal with the ""snowflakes."" I knew what he meant, but I asked him to clarify, he said people who think they're special and want everyone else to solve their ""problems."" This, and many other reasons are why I can't tell him at this point in my life. There really is a huge stigma around mental health with my dad because he divorced my mom because of her many mental health issues. On top of that my family's religious beliefs just would complicate things even further. I'd never hear the end of it, I'd be treated differently for a very long time. I know you don't need this info, and can't do anything with it, but I really just want to try and do everything in my power to prevent the school having to telling my dad. There really is just no need to stir up old issues.

I'm sorry this is SO long! I feel really badly about all of this. But at the end of the day, please don't see me for any worse than I already am. I understand if you do, and again I feel awful about writing you this long thing. I just really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for being such a good teacher and person, and for being there for me.‚Äù

I bet he thinks I‚Äôm over dramatic now. Probably. I really doubt I‚Äôll talk to the counselor this week now. You‚Äôd think if this was important to them, they‚Äôd have contacted me about it by now. Especially since F said that she said she‚Äôd talk to me. Maybe she‚Äôs on vacation. Who knows? I really don‚Äôt want to have to talk to her now. I solve my own issues.

I‚Äôm not looking forward to tomorrow. Work, critiques, whatever the aftermath of that email is, who knows. I‚Äôm just in for a mess."

I‚Äôm so scared. I can‚Äôt wait. Not that I‚Äôm excited. It‚Äôs just that the wait is killing me. I literally CAN‚ÄôT wait. I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt think about anything other than what will happen tomorrow.

I think I figured out why I was never called to see the school social worker on Friday. I think F must‚Äôve emailed the wrong counselor. Apparently the school is rich enough to afford two social workers. AND NONE OF THEM THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TALK TO THE KID WHOS MOTHER DIED OVER SUMMER BREAK. FUCK THEM.

Anyways, I‚Äôm just positive I‚Äôll get a pass tomorrow. Man... I really hate how well I am at masking my emotions. I‚Äôm really good at that... almost manipulative. Shit, I‚Äôm turning into mom. Oh god. Oh my god. Everything makes sense. She died and now I‚Äôve got bits of her anxiety, bipolar, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Where I go downhill is if I‚Äôm medicated. I must not let myself be medicated. I will not let myself be medicated any thing whatsoever. Ever. Listen to me, future self, if you‚Äôre reading this. You CANNOT let yourself be put on meds like mom. You know what that did to her. There‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs not here right now to tell you.

I‚Äôm losing my sanity. This anxiety is making me want to cut more, not stop. But I‚Äôve gotta suppress and fake it for a while. Shit. The cuts were on my legs. I hope to god I don‚Äôt have to show anyone tomorrow... or ever. I miss cutting. It‚Äôs only been half a week and I‚Äôm already nothing without it.

But remember, your story is that you cut yourself when your mom died because you felt alone and numb. You didn‚Äôt know who you were without the pain of her loss. You felt like you didn‚Äôt deserve to be happy. So you cut yourself for punishment. And soon you cut yourself for every negative thing that happened. Finally you were able to stop around New Years. You quit. Threw away your pencil sharpener blades. You were clean. Here‚Äôs where the lie kicks in. You stopped, pretty much completely rid yourself of impulses. You are happy and high on life. You love your school. Your family. Your church. You are no longer saddened by moms death. You are happy. The cuts that F saw were only a tiny relapse. Why? Because you dreamt mom faked her death and was still alive, combined with the stress from the 20 pc. project.

You are gonna fucking get through this you hear me? You tell that social worker you are 16, and there is no need to contact dad. And if she says she has to, ask her if you can wait until your scabs are gone in a week. And if all goes wrong, if she has to tell dad, then you DO NOT fuck it up the rest of the day. And you tell F what you planned to.

You tell him you wore shorts because you were finally getting over it, that you were just ready for nice weather, that you thought it covered your leg completely. You tell him you don‚Äôt do ‚Äúthat‚Äù anymore like you used to. That what he saw was a small slip up after a few months of being clean. Tell him you‚Äôre sorry he had to be a part of this. You fucking apologize.

But instead of talking to myself in the third person, I‚Äôm just gonna cry now probably have a small panic attack. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll fuck everything up tomorrow. I usually do."

All I can think about is when he saw. ‚ÄúHey (me), what‚Äôs on your leg?‚Äù I keep saying it over and over until I get the right tone, pitch, and speed. Just so it haunts me. And it does. I feel it weighing over me. Like a virus that‚Äôs infected my thoughts. Good and bad. ‚ÄúWhat was that on your thigh?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen did you do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow long have you been doing that?‚Äù And on and on. I can see his face. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs disappointment, or sadness, confusion, or frustration.

I know deep down he wants to help. That‚Äôs who he is. Maybe we both think it‚Äôs too awkward to talk about. I bet he thinks I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt blame him. I definitely gave off that vibe. But at the same time I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt need to know these things about me.

I want to tell him something on Monday. Not a lot. Just something to end this mess. I wanna tell him I‚Äôd never meant for anyone to ever see that, especially him.. and that I just wore shorts because I thought they covered my leg there and it was so nice out etc. I want to tell him that I want him to know that I don‚Äôt do that anymore, this time was just a small slip up.

But I‚Äôm scared. Scared that I‚Äôll end up talking to the counselor before his class. I‚Äôm scared it will end horribly. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be in no place emotionally to talk to him. I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt have a chance on Monday. I‚Äôm so scared of dad finding out.

Work helped clear my mind. I‚Äôm going to shower now and try to rehearse what I‚Äôll say... go over Thursday again.. and maybe cry.

I was so tired last night. J and I got into another fight because he threatened to kill himself even though he knows I‚Äôm not mentally capable of dealing with that at the moment. I had a panic attack and then he tried to force me to open up to him even though I know he isn‚Äôt mentally capable of helping me either.

He always begs me to let him help and then immediately proves that he can‚Äôt. Then he gets upset when I deny him. I feel so useless, not being able to support him anymore.

He can‚Äôt even seem to take any of this seriously either. He made a joke during the whole ordeal. I said, ‚ÄúStop it, this isn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù to which he replied, ‚ÄúBooo‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt texted him back since last night even though he apologized after a while of my silence. I‚Äôm afraid of what I might say to him.

He always does that. He always messes up and apologizes only to make the same mistakes over and over again. I don‚Äôt know how much of that I can take. He asked me to forget he said anything, as if that helps at all. How can I just forget it?"

The day after...

I woke up paranoid. I could barely breath. I just lay there clutching my pillow. I rehearsed my lies and lines in my head in case I had to talk to the social worker, or to F. I wore pants and long sleeves today. Definitely will NOT be wearing shorts or my dress any time soon.

I tried to keep myself together all morning. I felt like everyone was watching me. When I walked, I felt the air literally pass through me. It was like my soul had drifted so far from my body. I was an anxious zombie. Anxious. All day long. I couldn‚Äôt stop bouncing my leg. When I started it just kept going like my anxiety would just trickle down my legs and out of my toes if I did it long and hard enough. Even now I can‚Äôt get my foot to stop moving.

I started to tear up in math. Accidentally made eye contact with Mrs. L. She asked me to come see her. I grabbed my scratch paper from the quiz and handed it to her and she asked me to come out in the hall with her. Something about math. She asked if I was okay, it this was about her class. I reassured her it was not. Later Gib asked what she talked to me in the hall about. I just said it was about me being gone yesterday. Good save not gonna lie. I made the big mistake of spilling the tea around my moms death around him and Brook. Now they know everything, kind of.

By the time it was 5th hour I was doing fine. I had been so paranoid of having to talk to the social worker, and nothing had happened yet. Although every time someone opened a door my eyes automatically looked to see who it was. I felt like I was on some sort of drugs. So anxious. By the end of 5th hour I started realizing what was going to happen the rest of the day. Then I got super anxious again. All day long I could stop thinking about what he said. ‚ÄúHey (me). What was that on your leg?‚Äù I start shaking at the thought.

So I went down to lunch. I was in no shape to eat. My stomach was churning. Plus I didn‚Äôt want to risk running into him in the cafeteria. I sat in the hall. Hugging my knees close to my chest. Someone asked me if I was okay. Just said my stomach hurt... which wasn‚Äôt a complete lie. River made a car for one of the hundreds of Mardi Gras babies that have been hidden around the school. It was the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I laughed like I‚Äôve never laughed before.

Then the bell rang. It was time for 6th hour. Eventually I‚Äôd have to face F today. I just kinda sat there staring into the distance all scrunched up. I couldn‚Äôt really focus. Sometime later he came in, mentioned something about our 20 pc. project, and talked about the art show. He asked different people if they‚Äôve submitted anything, then he suddenly became really interested in making sure I‚Äôve submitted lots of stuff. I couldn‚Äôt get the words out of my mouth to tell him I‚Äôd already submitted a handful of things yesterday. Then he came over and sat in the seat next to me. He asked if I had all 20 pieces of my art done. I said no. He asked how close I was. Not very. He asked how many I got done. 12.. if I watercolored two of these cyanotypes. He suggested I should submit my large cyanotype and my flower print. That‚Äôs when I told him I already submitted a lot. He said I should do these too. He asked if I was going to make more cyanotypes. I said I guess so. He said I should print out more of my pictures and make cyanotypes. So I did. He let me use his computer, which I now know the password to. He gave it to me yesterday. So I sat down by the printer and printed out some negatives. I had to ask where the paper was I was cutting yesterday was. The paper I was cutting when he.. saw. He said was on top of the cabinet. So I got it down. Sure enough it was there. So I took my paper, went into the changing room. And went to work. I made three cyanotypes before the end of 7th hour. But the last one wouldn‚Äôt take much more time.

Then it was after school. Grace was in there talking to him for half an hour or so. I just sat in the changing room. I was so tired I sat down and let my head rest on the table, and kind of eavesdropped. Some time later when she left, he knocked on the door and asked if I was okay. He said he hadn‚Äôt heard me working. I just said I spaced out a bit. He asked how many I‚Äôve made. I said I‚Äôve just got one more to do. So he left to go to the bathroom or something and I made my last cyanotype. I stood in front of the timer for 7 minutes just watching the hands go in circles. Then I tentatively opened the door to go rinse off my last print. He asked if it went okay. Then when I was hanging it up to dry he asked if I had went to see the social worker today. I just said no and turned away and tried to ignore his question. He went to put my 12 things away, and I shyly asked if I could have two of the cyanotypes to watercolor. He said sure. Then I asked what drawer they went in.

I tried to hurry and grab my bag. He looked at me and said that he was sorry to bring it up again, but that he wanted me to know two things. He cares about me. That he doesn‚Äôt want anything happening to me. Then he said he also doesn‚Äôt want this to come between us. He said he really enjoys my company and making art in here together etc. He said he hopes I‚Äôm not mad at him. I said I wasn‚Äôt. He said he won‚Äôt bring it up anymore if I don‚Äôt want to. I said I was sorry a bunch more. Then he tried to end things on a positive note by talking about a concert he was going to. I laughed a little. I went to head out the door. He said to have a good weekend. I gave a very muffled bye. I‚Äôm not even sure I heard myself say it.

I almost burst into tears when I got around the corner in the hallway. I texted dad and went to go sit on the steps. He got there quicker than I thought. F hadn‚Äôt even gotten in his car yet. I wiped away my tears and put on my normal happy routine. But I was exhausted. We went to go pick up my sister. I kept looking our the rear view mirror to see if F was behind us because I know he goes to the same place we were to pick up his son. For a while he was two cars behind us. Then disappeared.

I got home and just collapsed on my bed. After a while I felt like I didn‚Äôt communicate things very well to F. I considered emailing him something, but then I realized emailing would be weird because I always just message him on group me. I told him that BTW, I was not mad at him at all, and to please not think that. And I really don‚Äôt see the point in talking to a social worker I don‚Äôt even know. I thanked him and told him I was sorry for him having to be involved with this. He replied later when I got off work and was watching TV.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not angry with me. Thanks for that. I don‚Äôt know exactly what happens next. I talked to Ms K and she said she‚Äôd talk to you. I don‚Äôt know what needs to happen next. Did she send you a pass and you didn‚Äôt go?

FYI- I‚Äôm up in ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî at a concert so I may not respond. I promise I‚Äôm not avoiding you! Maybe let‚Äôs talk about it more on Monday. I‚Äôll let you lead. If you don‚Äôt want to talk, I won‚Äôt bring it up. Try to have a good weekend. Everything will be OK.‚Äù

I told him that I did not receive a pass today. I thanked him for being there for me. I apologized and told him to enjoy his concert. He replied;

‚ÄúThanks. Hopefully I can still hear tomorrow! And don‚Äôt be sorry. I know you feel bad. But it‚Äôs OK. Things will work out.‚Äù

He keeps saying it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not okay. Things won‚Äôt work out. Things will never be totally the same. I know this is for the best. I did want him to know about my SH, and I got my wish. I just wanted him to know I was in pain. I felt so alone in this struggle and I needed the person I admired the most to know. He‚Äôs a mentor to me. More than any one else. I strive to be like him someday.

I‚Äôm just so nervous now. He said he won‚Äôt bring this up again unless I do. But that‚Äôs my weakness. My biggest fucking weakness. I DO NOT. Bring things up. Ever. I would never tell him I‚Äôm struggling. I would never tell him I‚Äôve got a problem with something. I cut my fucking thigh up and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù exposed it. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking in the moment‚Äî but I did it regardless. So now I‚Äôm the kid who self harms for attention, although it didn‚Äôt used to be that way. I want to talk to him. I just want to clarify things. Clarify that I only wore shorts because I thought they wouldn‚Äôt show. Clarify that I‚Äôm not mad at him. Clarify that my dad can ABSOLUTELY NOT KNOW. I hope a time comes up for me to talk. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be called into counseling before his class on Monday. That will be a whole new shit show. It‚Äôs either going to go really well, or god-awful.

Oh. And Logan made me a ring. The most thoughtful gift I‚Äôve ever received. I love it. I love him. He‚Äôs such a great friend. Him and Jeana. Love them all.

So now I‚Äôm going to try to be calm. What a mess I‚Äôve dug myself into."

My brother filmed an interview with me tonight. It‚Äôs for his adolescent psychology class in college. I think it went pretty well.

Mr. F made another snide comment about my religion. I don‚Äôt hate him because he‚Äôs Catholic. I hate him because he uses his religion as an excuse to be an asshole.

We started a new project in art recently where we re-draw children‚Äôs drawings with our own twists and write stories for them. Mr. P read mine to the class and they said it was scary. I take that as a win.

I met up with the school psychologist today. That wasn‚Äôt fun.

I cut some of the meat off of the deer rib I took from that decomposing buck. Then I sanded it down. It‚Äôs in salt right now so the remaining skin and meat will dry up and scrape off later. I want it to look nice because I‚Äôm giving it to someone as a gift in October.

J is getting on my nerves. He says things and then when I ask him to explain he goes around in circles with nonsensical things until eventually saying exactly what he‚Äôd said before and getting angry when I tell him he didn‚Äôt explain anything.

How does that work?"

I told Her about my relapse the other day and edging too. Didn't tell Her why I had a breakdown the other day per say but I don't think I need to. I don't think it really helps anything in our relationship (as long as my anxiety goes away eventually). I didn't do any homework today and I have to go to the city tomorrow to do scary stuff that I am really not looking forward to. I played a lot of different video games today and had fun doing it! I tried like 3 different single player games and enjoyed all of them (although the last one I barely played). Hopefully I will actually finish one of them at least :p I still need to play breath of the wild too but that game is soooo long so we will see how that goes. Alright, that's all for now."

He knows about my SH...

It was a normal class period. I made a huge cyanotype, the bell rung for class to get out, I went over to the sink to wash out my cyanotype. F thought it was awesome. I felt so proud that he liked something I made. A photograph even. He even took a video of me putting in the hydrogen peroxide. Some time passes, I asked if I could stay and finish up making two more for my project. He said sure.

I was tearing the paper down to size when I had my leg up on the chair for added support for when I was tearing. F was sitting at the table in the front and looked up to tell me something and that‚Äôs when he saw my thigh. I tried to not freak out and I put my leg down and pulled my shorts down subtly and went to line up my ruler when he said, ‚ÄúHey (me) what‚Äôs on your leg?‚Äù I just kinda stood there looking at him and and went ‚Äúhmm?‚Äù Like I had no idea what he was talking about. He said ‚ÄúWhat was that on your thigh?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh... nothing‚Äî I just.. I...‚Äù and silence from me. I was shaking. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I couldn‚Äôt get words out of my mouth. He asked when I did ‚Äúthose.‚Äù I stood there shaking and dumbly said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.. a few weeks ago. A lie, it was last night.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He asked if anyone knew, if my dad knew. He asked how long I‚Äôd been doing this. I said since Octoberish. I told him I‚Äôve stopped. I told him I‚Äôd never do it again. He confessed he didn‚Äôt really know what to do. He wanted to help but didn‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt blame him. I told him my sister found out, he kept asking what she said, what she did. He said he wanted me to know that he doesn‚Äôt feel different about me in any way, that this doesn‚Äôt change how he sees me. He said I was really talented and a great person etc. He said he cares about me. And when he said he didn‚Äôt see me any differently I believed him. I do. I just realize now that this was something he should not know about me. I confessed this year has been really hard. He said he knew this year has been hard on me. I don‚Äôt know if he knows the specifics. But I have a feeling he does. He asked if I‚Äôve ever talked to a therapist or counselor or anything. The answer was no. He said they could really help. Someone that wasn‚Äôt my parents or my sister or my friends, or a teacher. And maybe he‚Äôs right. But now I‚Äôm sitting here thinking of what lies to tell the counselor tomorrow when I know that‚Äôll just leave me more broken.
He asked what my dad would do if he found out. I didn‚Äôt know how to answer that honestly. Because I don‚Äôt know. I told him he‚Äôd never trust me. That I‚Äôve worked so hard to be trusted and I‚Äôve finally got it. He seems to think my dad would be okay, and not get mad.

He said that he‚Äôd send an email to the counselor saying that a student of his was cutting themselves, and that if they went in to talk to a counselor, if they‚Äôd have to tell their parents or not. He asked if that was fair. It was more than fair. I thanked him. I told him I was sorry. I told him I was sorry he had to see that, get involved with this. He kept reassuring me.

Things got quiet and I hurried into the changing room to start on my prints. I stood there for a few minutes, just processing. I wasn‚Äôt even hardly crying. ‚ÄúHe knows, he finally fucking knows.‚Äù I thought. He knocked on he door after a few minutes to ask me something about the darkroom. I answered. I still could barely move. But I made myself make those two prints I needed done before tomorrow. I could barely use my hands. I felt drained. Empty. I had to come out to ask him for some more tape. He said he was sorry to ruin such a good day. I told him it wasn‚Äôt his fault.

I went back in and made my print. I brought it out to wash it out. He acted like nothing had happened. I was still teary eyed and couldn‚Äôt really talk back normally. I told him I was sorry again. I wanted to tell him I was sorry it had to be him to find out. I didn‚Äôt. I went back in to make my other print. I didn‚Äôt have much time. I sat in there for 7 minutes while my paper exposed. Then he knocked on the door and came in saying he had to go pick up his son now or else he‚Äôd be late. I told him all I needed to do was wash it out. He said that was fine and I washed it out.

I kept telling him I was sorry. I was so sorry. I hurried and grabbed my things and left. He said he‚Äôd see me tomorrow. I said bye. And I quickly walked down the hall.

I was trying to keep my cool, when I saw Lilah so I went to go talk to him.

The rest is normal. I can‚Äôt believe he saw. I can‚Äôt believe this is happening. This can‚Äôt be happening. I want to die.

I lay here wondering if he‚Äôs worried about me. I don‚Äôt want him to. Did he tell his wife? I would in his situation, but still. I feel embarrassed. Will he talk to me tomorrow? Will the counselor call me out of class? I‚Äôm so scared. I really don‚Äôt want my family finding out. I know he will think of me differently. Not worse maybe. But differently. He said he wouldn‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs just plain impossible. I wonder if he realizes that all the times I‚Äôve cried or looked sad in his class, that I went home and cut myself. Will he connect dots? God I sure hope not. But I kind of do.

I guess I‚Äôll report what happens tomorrow. I‚Äôm pretty nervous. I just can‚Äôt get his sad face out of my head."

What a strange feeling it is to find out that you've been hacked.

I had that experience this morning, just as me & the wife were getting ready for work.

Already in a daze having just woke up & not really having my wits about me,¬†

you can imagine the¬†horror when I saw my bank account reading -$458.¬†

I was supposed to have at LEAST $80.00 left, which was to last me

until Friday when I can mooch of the Wife's Payday. But there it was. 458 fucking dollars in the hole.

Even before I found who the culprit was, I knew I'd been hacked.

Sure enough, I check my history & some asshole had hacked my Pay Pal

& managed to rack up nearly $1000.00 worth of fraudulent charges.

Fortunately, living close to the edge, as most people in my income bracket are prone to do,

I had only $80.00 they could grab, but still. I needed that money to live.

After I got over the hysterics & sick to my stomach feeling, not to mention having downed

an energy drink, I was able to eventually step back & analyze the situation & I got to thinking;

Considering we have been dealing in digital currency for pretty much at least, the last 20 YEARS,

& possibly even longer, combined with the sheer staggering numbers of hackers that are out there,

it was almost an inevitability I get hit. The numbers alone bear this out.

that being said, it still doesn't make it any easier, knowing you've been a victim of online fraud.

The feeling of both panic & anger, to say nothing of the feeling of being violated. Of having¬†

your financial¬†security ripped out from under you, temporarily at least.

So, as I'm taking the bus to work, my mind trying to process the whole thing,

I inevitably got to feeling sorry for myself. Pondering the predictable questions like; Why me?

What have I done to deserve this, etc.

Althewhile our bus passing Homeless people huddled in doorways on this cold & rainy morning.

And for the briefest of moments, I was able to step outside of myself & look at the bigger picture.

Yes, I was out $80.00, but there was a better than good chance I would have that back before the end of the day.

Yes, I had been violated, but they didn't get much, if anything from me.

Yes, I was going to have to forgo Breakfast, but I'm trying to lose weight, & it's not like I couldn't skip a meal or two.

Meanwhile, as I said, I'm seeing Homeless people on the streets, many of whom are mentally ill. Far worse than I.

Some probably can't even REMEMBER the last time they even saw what a $20.00 bill looks like.

I have my lovely wife, who ALWAYS has my back. In SO many ways.

So while I may be out a few bucks & a breakfast, in some ways...I'm the luckiest sonofabitch alive."

Things might change soon. I accidentally updated my phone to the new software update that features ‚Äúscreen time.‚Äù Big mistake on my part, considering it gives my parents access to what apps I use, for how long, at what time, and even what websites I go to and how long. My life of phone privacy is basically over until I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm writing this on my google chrome app on the mobile website because it‚Äôs the only search engine app that doesn‚Äôt show which fucking website I go on. ALSO, I can no longer clear my search history. Which sucks because my last searches were self harm related. Now I only use safari for totally innocent searches. I had to delete reddit, iFunny, YouTube, literally the only thing I do on my phone now is instagram. Which, thank god, is all I NEED anyways.

Besides this new complication to my life, things have been pretty normal, well, normal for me. Maybe unusual would be a better word. F was gone Monday. When I saw him Tuesday he gave me a big two handed high five when I was going to the cafeteria. He made me feel appreciated. Anyways, just thought that was notable.

Today was mediocre. When I was getting off the bus I saw F get in his car and leave for his thing he was missing school for. I sat down in the cafeteria, went to 1st hour, then third then fifth. The average routine for a Wednesday. Lunch was alright. Oh, and I wore shorts today. My DIY long shorts I made from old jeans. Just the perfect length to cover my cuts/scars. But I can‚Äôt cross my legs with many people around because you can see my cuts if I do so. I may have to stop sitting cross legged all the time, this spring and summer anyways.

7th hour was okay. We had a sub, he seemed to like me. I helped him with his crossword puzzle. I planned on making a 16x20 inch Cyanotype today, with my baby knowledge of cyanotype. If I could get it to work I could really impress F. And it would be pretty damn cool looking. I got everything set up, but I ran into some printer software issues. I troubleshooted for an hour and finally gave up and emailed F. I felt bad emailing him on his day off. He responded and said the software only works on his laptop. Damn. I thanked him for his troubles and sat down and thought for a while.

Then I remembered about my copper etching I needed to do TODAY. I grabbed some copper, got Mrs. H to unlock the jewelry room and I cut my sheets down to size. I plugged in the hot plate and got my setup ready. The ball ground went on okay, until I started rolling it out. It got splotchy on the corners and was kind of uneven. There wasn‚Äôt much else I could do to fix it. It started smoking so I took it off the burner. I was able to roll it out a bit better when it was off. I did some research on the etching solution and then I made an attempt. The sub had to leave early after school so I only had enough time to let my copper etch for like 7 mins. I barely had time to clean up the ferric chloride and put my stuff together. The sub was about to leave when I realized I forgot about the hot plate and the mess in the changing room. I messaged F later to apologize in advance for the mess.

The rest of my Wednesday was typical and nothing notable happened. Although I‚Äôve been cutting my legs a lot recently for no clear reason. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm cutting because I like to look at the cuts and the blood, not because I hate myself. I do hate myself. F just does such a good job of making me NOT hate myself. I didn‚Äôt choose him. He chose me. Maybe.

I cut my legs more tonight. They‚Äôre sure noticeable, fresh cuts on my legs will be more concerning than old scars, if he even did see those anyways. I hate to be the person who cuts for ‚Äúattention.‚Äù But this is my cry for help. I‚Äôve been struggling with this since October. My legs have hundreds and hundreds of scars. Layers and layers. I‚Äôm sick, and I know it. I need help, I just can‚Äôt get it. If F sees, maybe he‚Äôll understand my pain. Maybe my hurting will make sense. I don‚Äôt know. But if he sees, I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôll tell counseling or not. If they find out, most likely they‚Äôll tell my parents. And to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôd do. They would treat me like an outsider, that‚Äôs for sure. My freedoms would become increasingly limited. I guess I‚Äôll just blame it on moms death. That‚Äôs the root of all my problems this year anyways. Especially the self harm. Then maybe I can figure out what her fucking cause of death is. The exact one. ‚ÄúDying in her sleep‚Äù is not a valid conclusion.

Anyways. I‚Äôm in trouble. I‚Äôve got a LOT of work to get done tomorrow that can‚Äôt be ruined my emotional distress. But I‚Äôm willing to take the risk now, to let out these feelings I‚Äôve been bottling up since last June. Better when I‚Äôm a bit more stable than a total wreck.

God, I hate myself."

I feel awful thinking it, but I honestly believe she‚Äôll be better off without him. He had an insatiable drug addiction and he was one of those people that didn‚Äôt want to get better.

Today was alright I guess. I didn't have many bad thoughts today or anything. A few anxiety attacks about bad thoughts/the past/ if I find Her attractive (which I do) combined with panic over feeling compelled to share these things but they don't help at all and also a lot of sexy thoughts about Her but nothing to do with them per say. Also I feel fat right now and I think that's half of what my scale says(after a weekend of eating junk) and half feeling dumb with score work. I want to have a normal healthy sexual relationship with Her but I know that's hard for both of us and I need to study for an exam that I don't even know how to prep for. It's gonna be yet another long week! And I just remembered another assignment that I have due this week, hooray! Hopefully typing this out helps me feel better but I don't think it will. Alright, that's all for now."

My dad and I went out into the woods to cut the head off of a dead buck today. It was mostly skull but there was a lot of skin and muscle where we had to cut on the neck. I also snagged two ribs and a femur.

Preparation for the extraction included:
1) Several pairs of strong rubber gloves
2) Dust masks and a balaclava for me
3) Strong lavender perfume
4) Two trash bags
5) A small handsaw
6) Thick twin

Once we tracked down the carcass, we started by putting on the gloves and masks. We sprayed our masks with the perfume (to ward off the stench, the buck had to have been rotting for a few months) and sprayed the surface of the body to remove the few bugs on it. I began by taking the hand saw and cutting through several layers of skin and muscle on the neck, directly under the skull. Once I got to the spinal cord, my dad took over and cut it the rest of the way.

We set the skull aside. Dad stepped away and I proceeded to cut off two ribs fairly easily with the saw. Next, I removed an entire leg at the hip joint. I then cut through another joint and retrieved the femur bone. We placed all of the bones and the skull into a trash bag, put that trash bag into another trash bag, tied off the top, and tied it again with twine.

I helped dad cut the antlers off once we got home. The buck had a beautiful spread. It‚Äôs a gorgeous set of antlers. We‚Äôre planning on picking up a plastic skull to mount them on since I want to use the real skull and dad doesn‚Äôt want to have to clean it out.

Our neighbor was nice enough to let us put it in his compost pile. We‚Äôll pull it out next year and it should be cleared off of skin and other tissues.

I‚Äôm not sure what I want to make with it. Maybe I‚Äôll fill it with some fake flowers and make a floral arrangement in it. Maybe I‚Äôll make a headpiece. Who knows? I have a year to decide.

I might post some pictures from our extraction later on."

I had some WEIRD dreams last night including being at school way into the night, Mr. A doing very gross things, and a whole lot of weird shit. Anyways, who cares. I woke up about 40 mins before I had to get ready. I started thinking about college again. Ugh. I realized I‚Äôm just not going to be able to get two years of a foreign language in. I wanna go to the art institute SO BAD. But I am.. in a way this summer. God, I‚Äôm SO excited.

Anyways I was very stressed and crying already at 10 in the morning. Not a great start. I went to work and kinda felt bad. I really just did NOT want to work today. I faked being sick around 2:00 and went home. I feel guilty, but I really just needed a break. I am so tired.

Hung around the house for a while, watched tv, cleaned my room a bit, hung some art up. Flash forward and it‚Äôs like 7 PM. I went to Starbucks to work. I was not very productive. I went to cvs and bought some makeup. I wanted to be all punk and edgy. Then after a long time of messing with it at home and getting eyeliner on my eyeball. I realized I look better in natural makeup anyways. It was still fun though.

Now it‚Äôs raining and I didn‚Äôt get hardly any art done today. I‚Äôm gonna have to go crazy tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna make the fruit posters. I‚Äôll do two other drawings instead.

I‚Äôm not gonna stress. I‚Äôm kind of sad though. Fink won‚Äôt be at school Monday. I don‚Äôt know why exactly. Maybe it has something to do with the magazine. Who knows.. I should sleep. It‚Äôs so late. Maybe I‚Äôll dream again. "

I woke up earlier than expected today. I usually sleep until a little before noon on weekends. I don‚Äôt have to go to work until 2:40 PM on Saturdays. But today I woke up at 6:00 AM. I don‚Äôt know why.

J and I got into another argument. He asked me how I was and I can‚Äôt lie to him. I never could. So I admitted that I‚Äôm not doing so great. He got mad at me. I understand that he has problems too. I get that. But I am afraid for my life as well. I told him I couldn‚Äôt take his issues on top of mine right now but he keeps pushing. I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt think he cares about me very much.

Work wasn‚Äôt so bad, though. I‚Äôm on hosting duty for the next week because I fell and hurt my hand. So no lifting trays for me. Not for a while.

J scares me. He always says he‚Äôll be better. He always apologizes just to turn around and do it again. I can‚Äôt trust him and he makes me feel bad for not trusting him. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I am scared."

I totally forgot to write last night. What a dumbass. To be fair, I didn‚Äôt get home until 10, but still...

My memory is a little fuzzy, but it was a pretty normal morning. I started on a new ink drawing during second hour. Studied for my vocab test in third hour. And 4th and 5th were boring. Mrs. H wants me to do the softball poster, AND, some huge project for the band. I don‚Äôt really want to, but I don‚Äôt think I have much of a choice.

I took a pic of my horizontal ink drawing and posted it to insta during 6th hr. Then I just worked on my other drawing. I got about halfway done with it. Fink walked by and said my art looked like Edward Gorey‚Äôs. I had never heard of him before and so I looked it up and was deeply honored. I don‚Äôt remember what we talked about for the rest of class, I do remember talking with our table in 7th hour about deep, and existential shit. Fink liked really stressed out about something, I didn‚Äôt dare ask though. And before I knew it, class was over. I had no excuse to stay after today because MYM wasn‚Äôt happening, and it would have been weird for me to stay and do nothing. So I talked in the hall with River and log for a while. Then with log for some time more when River left. Then I remembered I needed some paper for my project over the weekend, so I went back to Finks room to grab a couple sheets. While I was getting my paper he explained to me and Log he was stressed out earlier because his favorite band is doing a concert on the night of graduation. He really wants to go, he might try and figure out a way to get out of graduation. Personally I think he should go to graduation and not be sour about it. But who cares what I think. If my favorite band was playing for the first time in a long time, I‚Äôd probably pick that. Then log left because his ride was here, and I was still getting paper rolled up.

Somehow we got to taking about AP, and college, and stuff. He started talking to me about (local university) vs (art institute) when it comes to jobs and pricing and stuff. I confessed I hadn‚Äôt considered university because of my gpa and overall stupidity. He said that (local university) had a great art program, and so I asked about their printmaking one. I told him I don‚Äôt really care WHERE I end up, as long as I have a good studio, work environment, and teachers who know their stuff and would teach me better techniques, and whole new processes. He said (local university) had a great printmaking program, and that the teachers there are awesome. And he‚Äôs right, we had some sort of art coordinator from there come in recently and he was the coolest guy ever. He knew his stuff, and was probably the best guest speaker we‚Äôve ever had. Before I left I confessed I hadn‚Äôt even really considered college as an option until earlier this year, and that I don‚Äôt know how much of it works or any of the lingo because we just never talked about it at home.

I had kind of overstayed my welcome so I started to head out the door. I thanked Fink for letting me bother him with all of this college stuff and for the paper. He said I never bothered him. I don‚Äôt know if he meant that, or if he was lying to be nice. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd lie, but I still feel like I bother him too much.

So that conversation really got me thinking A LOT. Maybe (art institute) isn‚Äôt my best option. I looked up the price difference between there and university, and that‚Äôs 35k vs 8k a year. There  are downsides to university because I wouldn‚Äôt be strictly doing art and liberal arts classes, and that sucks, but at the art institute, I‚Äôd pretty much only be taking classes I like. BUT, class sizes at the institute are way larger than university. Also, university would probably give out better scholarships compared to the institute.

Ugh this is insane. Absolutely crazy. Now I‚Äôm seriously considering university over the institute. I don‚Äôt even know anymore. My plan is to apply to everywhere and just see what happens.

I just looked now, and I would be missing a few classes that are required to get into university like two semesters of a foreign language, and one year of math. Yeesh. I don‚Äôt want to try and make that up next year. I‚Äôd have to take a year or two at community college to do that. AHHHH, this is all BS I don‚Äôt need to put in my diary.

Anyways, yesterday I went to work, and a whodunnit murder mystery, (which we solved) at church. Then that‚Äôs it. Now I have to go to work for 10 more hours. Fuck me."

Accidentally deleted what I had written and I‚Äôm pissed at myself, so here I go again.

Woke up. Lost carving tool. Went to Finks room, borrowed one. Got seminar pass. Went to math on fourth floor. Found my lost carver. Carved for the whole period. Went to seminar. Cut paper to size. Carved block for remaining time. Ate lunch in hall. Fink commented on the state of the cafeteria chicken tenders today on his way to go do something.

Ok I‚Äôm caught up. After all that I went to English and praise god, she let us watch the great Gatsby and work on whatever. Naturally I was finishing up carving my block and it was pretty hard to see with all the lights off. Kendrick looked pretty worried like I was going to accidentally cut myself with the tool. Later when we stopped the movie and turned on the lights everyone in my vicinity just HAD to comment on my linocut. Even got Mrs. S to get up and look. I was kind of embarrassed, I hate people looking at my stuff WHILE I‚Äôm making it.

Went to 6th hour and finished up the last few details of my carving. I printed with the Akua ink which always makes a mess. I made 6 prints, 4 of which turned out good. Then I set them on a different table to dry. I pulled out my little horizontal ink drawing and worked on that for the rest of class. The custodians brought in a few big boxes of stuff. Fink said they had to use up their yearly spending money, that‚Äôs why it seems like there are new packages arriving every day. He got some copper eating acid and sat it on the table in front of me. I was confused until I actually read what it was and then got really excited. APPARENTLY, he‚Äôs got the wax stuff that goes on top, I‚Äôll have to ask him about al of that tomorrow and do some research tonight.

Before I knew it class was over. I still needed to paint my prints with water color, I asked Fink if he minded if I stayed for a bit and did that, he said not at all. So I silently worked for about 30 mins until I broke the silence and asked him some follow up questions about AP art Portfolio which I asked in seminar. He said to talk to Joss, and I did during 6th hour. I told him I talked to Joss and he was confused, and then he said he meant someone totally different and he said the wrong name. I felt so stupid but so did he because that was totally his fault.

I had asked what the point of taking AP art Portfolio senior year was if college applications are due next December anyways. Which I later figured out after school is that it gives you credits in college. He also asked if I thought about any other colleges besides (main choice) and I said not really. He suggested a few others and I didn‚Äôt seem that interested at first. But it definitely got me thinking. Maybe (main college choice) isn‚Äôt the only college I‚Äôll apply to! It‚Äôs worth a shot to apply everywhere and see who gives me the best scholarships.

I finished up my water colors and left to go to magazine which I did for like 5 mins and then left because dad was there to pick me up. I feel bad for leaving early. I really just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to be editor next year. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it. Anyways, I went home. Posted a pic of my prints to Instagram. Friended Fink on Facebook because he mentioned asking about AP stuff on his Facebook so I went ahead and thought this was a good opportunity to friend him. I also posted my prints to my Facebook and he liked it :). Then I did some research about AP college creds and emailed Fink about what I‚Äôd found.

Are tacos for dinner, then packed up my sketchbook and stuff and walked to Starbucks and stayed there till like 8:30. I was able to finish the remaining 70% of my horizontal ink drawing. They messed up my drink order and gave me a large one for the wait. They‚Äôre pretty nice! I got dad to drive me home and then I showered. I also emailed my counselor about the possibility of me changing to AP Portfolio next year.

I also found a really cool artist on Instagram that makes the kind of art I want to make. After thinking and thinking I finally have a rough battle plan. Get this copper intaglio printing method with the acid figured out and mastered by the end of the school year. Make a concentration of different prints and all sorts of varieties. Go to (first college choice) for printmaking, because chances are the scholarship money for printmaking is a lot easier to get than if I were to major in Illustration. And boom, there you have it! I‚Äôm so excited. This 20 piece project had me SO stressed, but has turned out to be a blessing. I feel like an unstoppable art making powerhouse! I just can‚Äôt wait to make cool shit.

I also forgot, I got an ad on insta for a really cool original Ponyo poster and it brought back so many fond memories. It‚Äôs really nice quality, and I got the whole thing for only 9.99 and free shipping. It might take a month to get here but I‚Äôm excited for when it does.

Ok so tomorrow I need to ask Fink about the copper printing, and steal some paper for my posters I‚Äôm making Sunday. Jeez, this week has just flown by at light speed. "

Alright, time to try and start this anew. Again. I have been having a really bad time with relapsing lately. I just haven't been able to get more than a few days stringed together before having another set back. It happened again today and I also feel like my thoughts and feeling were over the place and I was checking people out and stuff today and worried if I could like/love other people and life feels hard. I don't really know what I am doing anymore it seems. But it didn't really feel this way yesterday, not bleak or whatever it is that now feels. It comes in strange waves. Still not sure how to right this ship after trying for years. I can do this. I accomplish a whole lot of stuff in life, I can conquer this too. The day was long. I am tired of school and need to work more than normal tomorrow. I feel like I didn't do a good job of listening to Her when She was telling me about Her day (which I do too often). I need to get some rest. I should get back into calorie counting and meditation. Maybe things will be easier when this semester is over, idk. On a good note, I feel like my presentation went pretty well today. I ought to do this again tomorrow."

Oh my goddd my brain is in alert mode. I am literally SO stressed. Ok focus. Recap time. This morning was normal. Started on my linoleum carving in the end of 1st hour, and worked on it all through 3rd and 5th. I started feeling really numb towards the end of 5th hour. My stomach felt empty. I felt weak, and I couldn‚Äôt talk straight in lunch. I am being physically impacted by this stress. Raegan and I just cried about it all  through lunch. I went into 7th hour pissed and tired of life and this class, which is the reason I get out of bed most mornings.

I worked on my carving and Fink suggested I use this metal thing that helps you carve on tables and it didn‚Äôt help for what I was doing. I tried to politely decline. I thought today was going to be another repeat. About midway through the class, he asked me to help him screenprint, we kind of talked while he was mixing up ink. I admitted I was pretty stressed about this project. But he seemed to think I‚Äôd do fine. He said they don‚Äôt need to be fancy at all, but I can‚Äôt NOT overachieve in his class. I just want to impress him. He said I make stuff all the time and this wouldn‚Äôt be THAT much of a challenge. He‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs not, but I‚Äôve certainly never done it before.

After school I helped him print a few prints while Henry came in to set up his 3-D printer, the same Henry who‚Äôs skateboard I fell off of last Wednesday. This time he brought a friend. And FUCKKK, these guys were driving me crazy. They could be funny at times, but they were SO annoying. Fink was obviously annoyed with the friend of Henry‚Äôs. Had to tell him to put down the staple gun like three times and a handful of other stuff. Anyways, the rest of the time was a blur. Athena messed around with my water colors. She ended up texting me later and buying the same set.

Finally he got them to leave at like 3:30 and before I left I asked him if he had found a zine I‚Äôd lost in there on Monday. He looked around for a second and gave it to me without commenting. Maybe he read it, maybe he didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know. I get why he didn‚Äôt comment if he DID read it, but still. Part of me wishes. Anyways, I left and went to stand by the doors to go outside. Fink went into H‚Äôs room to look for something and came down to the storage room which was right behind me. He asked if I could help him wheel the cart of podiums in. I did. We talked briefly about Ikea. He hates it, I love it. Then I said bye and went to wait outside on the steps. It started sprinkling when I was out there. Fink drove by as he always did and waved.

I went to the art store downtown with dad afterwards. Got a crap ton of stuff. More than I meant to get, but I don‚Äôt regret anything. I love buying art supplies. Came home, and messed with them a bit. Made some marker swatches, etc. Dad ordered pizza for dinner, then we left for church.

Church happened, boring, then I got home and finished drawing a rough sketch of what all 20 of my pieces are gonna look like. Now I‚Äôm writing this. I really need to get started on my horizontal ink drawing right now. I didn‚Äôt finish carving during class today so I‚Äôm going to have to just do that tomorrow morning since I have a late start. Tomorrow I need to print and water color over my prints, and start on a pen drawing with water color, or my markers, and think of a design.

Great."

Holy shit, today was a disaster I barely managed to save in the end. Oh my god. I woke up at 3 because my sister was sick and dad was talking in the hall. I got up and drank some water and snoozed past my alarm and didn‚Äôt have time to shower. So already my day started crappy. All the juniors took the ACT today except for me and a small handful of people because we forgot. My first hour had barely anyone. I failed my math test, and the day started out pretty typically. I ate lunch, as I usually do. Raegan said something about a 20 piece assignment in portfolio and I had no idea what she was talking about, boy was I naive.

Walked straight into 6th hour and read the board. It read something like,
Art Portfolio:
Make 20 works of art by April 12th
Only art made after 4/2
Etc.

I saw that and freaked the hell out. It didn‚Äôt really kick in until Fink came in and was like oh, btw, portfolio your next assignment is on the board. He barely gave any explanation. I freaked out. I cried like Jeana having a mental breakdown in the middle of class. I cried and cried and could barely breath. I left the room to go to the bathroom. I was having some form of a panic attack. It took me a minute to get myself together and I went back to the room, except Fink wasn‚Äôt there. He was out helping IB kids with photo shit. I was pretty mad at him.

7th hour was no better. I was still crying and just having a total breakdown. When he came back he explained the project a lot better to 7th hour. I realized I didn‚Äôt have to make 20 PERFECT, high detailed pieces of my best art. But man. I was just not having it. I cried basically the whole hour and a half. I don‚Äôt know if Fink noticed. I think he did but he didn‚Äôt say anything. Of all times not to notice. I sure wish he would have. He went into the changing room before the bell rang and I didn‚Äôt get to say bye. I just walked out of the room barely holding myself together so I could make it to the bus without sobbing. I could barely breath on the bus. I thought much of suicide. It seemed like my only option. Then to cutting. It seems pathetic now that I look back. But that was my worst break down since before winter break.

When I got home I went straight to my room and locked the door. I found a blade in my dresser and cut a bunch on my right thigh. It stung but provided instant relief. It was like instant calming. Eventually I cleaned it, got dressed and went to work. Work sucked. Three constant hours of drive thru. Never ending cars. But about halfway through my shift I began to feel better. And like this project was beginning to feel more approachable.

We ordered McDonalds and took it home to my sister. After that I showered and sat on my bed and created a list of everything I was going to make over the next 10 days. I then organized it to what day I‚Äôd make what, and a list of what supplies I need. I texted dad and asked if we could go to the art store after art club tomorrow.

Oh and I just remembered, I messaged Fink at work asking about the project. But the truth was, I really just wanted to talk to him because I didn‚Äôt all day except for signing some art club form in 6th hour. He definitely helped reassure me about this big ass project. Though I‚Äôm still kinda mad. But I look at it now like a blessing in disguise. I love showing Fink my art. This is a great opportunity to show him a crap load of stuff and not feel bad.

I just have to stick to my schedule perfectly this week and next. I may have to forcefully make myself drink some coffee to get it all done.

I literally don‚Äôt know how I recovered from that meltdown. Maybe SH helps me? I don‚Äôt even know. All I know is that my legs are fucking ugly from all these cuts and scars. "

It‚Äôs getting harder to get up in the morning again. My purpose has left me. I need a reason, even if it is some self-centered, hypocritical one. But I got up eventually. Wore that damn lobster dress.

School was shit. It always is 4th quarter. I‚Äôm so ready to be free. Even for a few months. I made what I wrote last night into a zine. Very basic except for a tiny cover illustration and some text. Kept it in my pocket all day.

Lunch came and went. I didn‚Äôt have my power project done. But neither did any one else really. My new goal is to finish it by Friday. We‚Äôre going to start a new project tomorrow. I hope this one will be good. 7th hour was the same really. I didn‚Äôt talk to Fink much at all today. Maybe like one comment during 6th hour. And that‚Äôs it.

Zine club went alright. Although I feel like I kinda let my bad side of my personality get out. The one that talks and laughs too much. I hate her sometimes. She‚Äôs just a pathetic goof.

Wanna hear the real fucked up things I did today? I sat purposely in my chair exposed my scars on my left leg to anyone standing on that side of me. Which was only Fink whenever he was at his podium. I don‚Äôt think he saw. And if he did. I doubt he‚Äôd ever say anything. He cares. But he doesn‚Äôt care enough.

The second fucked up thing I did was purposely leave my depressing ass zine on the floor where he would see it. I‚Äôm SO pathetic. But I want him to read it. Athena asked about it and I said it was nothing. I never got the chance to say goodbye. I left with the others. Went to wait outside and realized I forgot my coat. I ran back in and grabbed it and said I forgot. Still no bye. It‚Äôs ok though. I‚Äôm not even deserving of notice or love.

All these things I consciously do for Fink to notice my pain and what have been the fruits of my labor? Whenever I scheme, he just grows farther, probably thinks I don‚Äôt care.

My sister made me a scrunchie. So there‚Äôs that too. I started and finished series 2 of The OA in one day. That show is so good. Now I‚Äôm about to sleep because I‚Äôm too tired to shower. I‚Äôm hoping tomorrow will bring me some clarity. Will Fink find my zine? Has he already found it? Did he notice my scars? Find out in the next episode of my pathetic life!"

Guess who didn‚Äôt get shit done today??? This girl! I only did the art & fear reading and that‚Äôs it. I didn‚Äôt have enough time anyways to make my project. I don‚Äôt care. Hopefully Fink isn‚Äôt mad.

Today was an average Sunday.

I did, however, go to old navy and buy some clothes. I got a dress. Which is kinda risky for two reason. Firstly, I never wear dresses and EVERYONE is going to notice. Secondly, if I sit the wrong way or do something weird with my legs, anyone could see my scars... WHICH may have an advantage.

Maybe one day I‚Äôll be sitting and Fink will see them accidentally. Who knows. It‚Äôs risky, but I want to wear it tomorrow unless it‚Äôs freezing cold.

We had the ice cream fundraiser at church tonight and a few baptisms.

And I wrote a poem of sorts. It‚Äôs a little sad. But I‚Äôm considering writing it into a zine and conveniently leaving it in Fink‚Äôs room somewhere where he will find it. Here‚Äôs what I wrote:

The park I once treaded with tiny feet
Stained crimson by death's messenger
A bitter letter delivered to two daughters
Of divorce and brainwashed insanity

See now what pain you've brought
To the child who loved her most
My sister cries aloud false wails
I eat the earth to keep from choking

A hollow hand creeps up my spine
The unfamiliar marital replacement
for death's newly appointed spokesman
Fickle condolences fall from her lips

Tell me this isn't real‚Äî this isn't so
The one who granted me life
Has been ripped of her own‚Äî alone
My dear mother, how I cry for you!

Vague answers and devious grandparents
Leave me shattered and torn
Left me in the dark like they did, you
Your voice has left my memory

Pictures can never capture what we had
All videos are out of my hands
All I have left are your words.
And the fleeting remnants of 16 years

Anyways. It‚Äôs vague and angsty and shit. I‚Äôm gonna do something with it tomorrow morning. I really hope to god Fink won‚Äôt be disappointed in me for not finishing. I‚Äôll act like I feel like shit.

ITS TIME I GET THIS OFF MY CHEST."

Today was another day I‚Äôll never remember. Except for the fact that I write things down here. Woke up, watched a few episodes of season 3 of the Santa Clarita diet, and went to work. Trained two new kids, one of which I couldn‚Äôt even pronounce their name. They were kind of annoying because they seemed so uninterested. Rest of the day was boring. Came back home and watched more tv and finished the rest of the season. Damn having a normal job must SUCK!

I started thinking recently about me wanting to be an editor of the magazine. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck a villanelle is, or know how many syllables a haiku has off the top of my head. I‚Äôve got all my chips in the art department, not the writing side. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll disappoint Mrs. A. I hope to god she doesn‚Äôt want me being editor next year. I‚Äôd love to be involved, but I just don‚Äôt want to be in charge.

But things might change, as they always seem to do. I‚Äôve been realizing how much I want to get back in touch with my writing/reading side. I want to make a zine. A bi-weekly type of thing maybe. Ugh. It‚Äôs too risky, having my free flowing thoughts potentially leave the classroom. Schools almost over anyways, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to let my sister get her hands on my writing next year. Ugh. My sister. A whole new bag of rocks to deal with next year. I‚Äôm so worried I won‚Äôt be able to be myself at school anymore. She‚Äôs a total snitch. I love her and hate her all at the same time. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm gonna do.

All I know is that I want to get in touch with myself more. I want to be MORE in touch with my emotions which is scary but could lead me down interesting paths. And I‚Äôd have time to do that without stressing if I take more off my plate.

I can do this. I can do it. Just gotta finish my project tomorrow. "

I‚Äôm gonna start setting less unrealistic goals so I don‚Äôt feel like a failure all the time. My only basic goals right now are to pass my classes, finish my high school portfolio by November, save for a nice workspace in my room, and work on my figure drawing capabilities.

I just gotta take things slow. I‚Äôve got time. I can do this. Don‚Äôt worry about making a lot of stuff, worry about making good quality stuff. Fink doesn‚Äôt give a shit about HOW much I make, just how well.

Focus on your future. Focus on your mind. Not the day to day.

But since I‚Äôm a fool and I focus on the day to day, today was pretty boring. Woke up at 11, we went on a short thunderstorm chase. Came back, ate lunch, I messed around for a bit. Asked my sis if I could take photos of her as a drawing reference and she complied. Went to work, came home, ate dinner and watched the x-files. Today was boring, I wish I could have gone to school, but on the other hand, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten those photos of my sis.

I think I want to turn that brown empty book I got for cheap into a practice figure drawing book. I could do my sketchbook, but I only want nice things in there. This book will literally be shit and that‚Äôs OK.

I wish I could go out on the porch like at our rental porch and just sit there and listen to the rain and music. But we don‚Äôt have a porch anymore which really sucks. I don‚Äôt want to go to bed yet but I should. Netflix just came out with season 3 of the Santa Clarita diet and I really wanna watch it right now. Probably might do that then pass out.

Just focus. De-stress. "

Sometimes I feel like I live at school. I can‚Äôt wait for next year. No math class, just English, SS, Science and a whole lotta art. Woke up at 7 and drew a dumb little mushroom drawing to turn into a screen print. I finished the sketch before I got to school. I went in to get a seminar pass from Fink. I was kinda nervous. We reviewed in math but I mostly worked on inking my drawing. Went to Finks room for seminar. He said he had to go to some teacher meeting in the office. I coated a screen, printed with the frog screen. Cleaned off the failure one, and when I was cleaning out the one that didn‚Äôt fail I accidentally got some of the emulsion remover on it and ruined it, so I cleaned the rest of it off and finished up like 10 mins into lunch. Went to lunch. River was already sitting at a full table so I sat with Alex and talked about life. Went to English and we made a vision board.

Then finally went to 6th hour. It was senior skip day so it was literally just us juniors. I sat down, started peeling an orange, while the rest of my table acted like hilarious idiots. We started making figure drawings of Henry that soon evolved into him t-posing/dancing on the table to Minecraft parodies and some Italian pizza song. It was funny but Fink seemed a bit annoyed. I finished up my drawing, and he helped me print it on film after I scanned and vectorized it. I then exposed and washed out my screen and it worked pretty damn well. By the time I was done class was about over.

Chinese club had a 5$ potluck type thing after school so I went to that with Henry. It was alright. Finished by 4ish and grabbed a cookie on my way out. I went back to Finks room to print my screen. I printed it on paper first with red ink. It would have been the perfect time for him to notice my wrist but no, he didn‚Äôt see my fuckin bruise. I also printed on a T-shirt he gave me. He told me that my 300$ scholarship was put into my account and it was all good to go. I told him thanks again and he said it really was his pleasure. When I was cleaning out my screen we talked about rain and radar apps and porches and leaky houses. Then I beat it to the super long magazine meeting.

We just rated submissions and shit. Pretty boring. I was in a group with Ian. Mrs. A talked to me a bit. I told her I wasn‚Äôt able to do any cadet teaching next year for her. But I told her I‚Äôd definitely be in the magazine. She asked if I had thought about teaching art, and where etc. I seriously considered it there for a second. Nope. I don‚Äôt want to teach at a high school. Not even a college. MAYBE speciality classes, but I do NOT want to be a teacher. But I won‚Äôt totally shut the idea out. We ordered pizza and it was ok. On the way out I checked Instagram. Fink posted a pic of the screen he finally figured out the printing setup with ‚Äúa lot of help from one of my brilliant students‚Äù (obviously a nod to me) I was so happy, what an absolutely kind compliment. I didn‚Äôt get home until 7:10ish.

He posted a pic of my T-shirt on the school art department insta. My glitter came in the mail. I took a bunch of insta stories comparing my fingernail polish, my shoes, and my new bag of glitter which happened to match to a tee. I decided to work on a stamp and I started making one of a leaf. Spent an hour or so working on that and I decided to go to bed because I‚Äôm pooped out.

Today wasn‚Äôt emotional. Which is ok. If every day was emotional I‚Äôd be worn out. I need to start my power project tomorrow for real. I‚Äôm exhausted I‚Äôm gonna sleep now. Maybe I‚Äôll dream. "

I did some schoolwork until i took a nap and then i woke up with a headache. i continued my schoolwork but couldn't absorb any information. Sunday is almost here and im slacking big time. i have to get it done and over with. i just never found a  way to study. Its easy to highlight words in the reader mode but there is no way to transfer it to another word doc. something has to give.

next Saturday we are giving up the dog. It took me 5 years to warm up to him and now he has to go away. Im going to miss him. When i get my own place, im getting a pet. Now i am going to be super lonely.

I have work at 9 am. I hate working early during the week because the morning managers are real bitches and always take their anger out on me. Boss lady Lynnette will be working.  I dont what to do to gain back her trust. It bothers me so much to where i can't stop thinking about it. It is consuming me. I want to text her but it wouldn't look right.  "

Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs been a weird week. And a weird day. Woke up to a bruised and swollen wrist. I decided to slam it against a screwdriver hammer last night. I‚Äôm such an idiot. The pain felt good in a way different than cutting ever did. It felt like real pain. It was dull but intense. My wrist was quite swollen last night, but it‚Äôs not so much now, it‚Äôs still slightly distorted, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go away.

Field trip was kinda fun. Sat near the front of the bus next to River and Raegan and Fink. We were separated into two groups to see different shows, I didn‚Äôt go in Finks group, but my group had the more responsible people. One thing I‚Äôve learned today: People who work in art museums are kind of big dignified cunts. They‚Äôre not mean, but can come off as subtly rude and snotty in my opinion. Note to self, never work at a museum in any important role.

Anyways, bus ride back was ok. I kinda felt a little drained after all that listening to uptight people talk for an hour, I was a little distant, but Fink tried to make conversation with River and Raegan and I, and I just can‚Äôt help but smile at everything he says. I mean, how can I not? Pretty much everything he says is funny or sweet, caring, or kind. There‚Äôs no end to his kindness.

We got back during lunch. I went to go get some food, and I sat in the hall. I went back to class a little early before class ended and decided to run some ink through my successful screen and it worked. I did it pretty quick too, by the time he  got back from lunch I was just finishing up washing off a scraper. A few mins later he asked if I wanted to try printing my screen and I showed him the print I had just made moments before. He thought it was cool. We agreed we should try something with higher detail. The rest of 7th hour was pretty average. I got really curious about different photographic methods and started to tentatively ask Fink about them. He said he was going to make a photo polymer print today anyways and I could watch. So I did. I just watched him in the changing room fail like 4 times and ruin a bunch of plates. It also smelled like horse shit with those chemicals from washing off the plates. I hope I didn‚Äôt give off a bored vibe. I really wasn‚Äôt, I was just kind of out of it.

I still have no clue what to do in art club anymore. It isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôve lost interest, just motivation and creativity. Margeaux and some kid with severe hyper active ADD came in with his cool one wheel electric skateboard thing. Fink asked questions about it and the kid gave a demo. He made it look pretty easy. The kid asked if we wanted to try and Fink seemed pretty eager to try. Fink has pretty damn good balance. Later he said I should give it a try. I was like what the heck sure, and hopped on. And damn it‚Äôs hard to balance. I can barely balance in my own two feet being 6‚Äô but on a wobbly one wheeled skateboard, I look like a pathetic newborn giraffe. Anyways, I was moving back and forth and it kept moving to the left no matter what I did and I lost control and fell backwards onto my ass flat on my back. It hurt pretty bad, but with bruises, they don‚Äôt usually hurt so bad right away. I picked myself up, and carried on.

I asked if he had a phone charger, I just plugged into his stereo. Played some music because I felt bad for unplugging his phone. 30 minutes of hyper active kid talking later, Oh, Sinnerman by Black Diamond Heavies was playing and Fink asked what band it was. I told him and I think he wrote it down!! Major coolness points scored today, except for my wipeout.

Oh and all fucking day long I held my right wrist with my left hand over the bruise painstakingly obviously, and not one glance or question except from Jeana.

I posted on my story about me bruising my tailbone. He replied and said he was so sorry for peer pressuring me into it. I said I was gonna sue jokingly and said it was fine. Eee, I hope he doesn‚Äôt feel bad. It was my fault.

I left, came home, made a sandwich, went to church, etc. Now here I am. Recording my pathetic life. I wish I were more honest with how absolutely twisted and self centered and manipulative I am. But I can‚Äôt bear to even write it down even to myself. I barely scratch the surface of how shitty I am. Anyways, my main goal tomorrow is for Fink to ask about the bruise on my arm. My secondary goal is to wake up early and draw a prettier design for a print and make that tomorrow, then I have an excuse to stay after school. And tomorrow is the super long magazine meeting. Great. Fuck you me. You‚Äôre a shitty manipulative self centered shit who just wants attention. Just fucking end your life already."

school been alright. im doing good in principles of management but in principles of marketing, im failing. those little quizzes that are 20 points are fucking me up. I can highlight keywords when i read and do good on the small quizzes but on the big ones, i fail hard. I don't know any ways to study.  I dont want to flunk one class because of the tests and quizzes. I have to find a way to study.


I thought my boss was done being mad at me but apparently she's not. I can feel it in her energy that she still has anger towards me for that one Saturday with the schedule incident. It hurts me that she doesn't consider me like her kids. It makes me depressed. I fucked up a good thing. All because of a coworker that's nosy and gossipy. Going to work been a challenge. Its hard trying to work without the boss giving you dirty looks. This is one of those moments where i want to quit or transfer to another store. Its like a bad breakup. "

Every day is just a series wins and loses. Things repeat and inch forward and yo-yo back. No wait, other way around, things just yo-yo forward and inch back. But I‚Äôm begging to inch back. Inching back to mom, to childhood, to creativity and less responsibility. And life keeps moving forward. It always will. I don‚Äôt know if I necessarily want it to though.
Every day is a new challenge and adventure, it gets a bit repetitive at times but so much happens in one day. I wake up. Brush my teeth, get dressed, put on some music and head to the bus. Wake up to Sinatra, fall asleep to dean Martin. It‚Äôs a loop. Everything is a cycle, even my music taste. I haven‚Äôt listened to Sinatra and enjoyed it since Rob. Each day repeats. Some day to day internal drama with myself and art or Fink or my family or church. Some new hurdle to get over each day. And it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs hard to have long term projects and goals when I‚Äôm trying to tackle these daily hurdles. But the fucked thing about me is that whenever those hurdles become easier and repetitive, I get bland and hate myself. Either way, I need to stop rambling. I need to shower.

‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòTwas a normal shitty Tuesday, same ole morning routine. My day doesn‚Äôt really start until lunch‚Äî which was fine. Ate an orange, briefly ran into Fink in the hall, ate my orange in the dark room with Jeana and river and the gang. Tried to tape Sterlob to the ceiling. Didn‚Äôt end up lasting long. Sat on my ass for half of 6th hour before Fink started talking to me about screen printing. I saw him talk to Price during lunch about the water hose for the power sprayer. He told me he talked to price, and we decided to coat a couple of screens. He helped me pour the emulsion into the coater because I spill it every time I try. I did the rest. The coat went on nice and smoothly for the first time. Turns it that rubber strip was making it too thick and weird. I coated two screens, left them to dry, fucked around a little and Fink asked me to come with him down to the custodian to get a key for the water thing outside. We got it to work, but the hose was fucked and wouldn‚Äôt work. We decided we‚Äôd bring hoses tomorrow and try again.

Got back in the room and I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to try exposing the screens 5 seconds more. I tried one and it worked slightly better but the emulsion still came apart. After that one. I decided to try 35 seconds rather 25. Used the sprayer attached to the sink in the dark room, and Shazam, it worked! FINALLY. I came out and was so happy, Fink seemed relieved more than excited. I don‚Äôt blame him, but I feel like he didn‚Äôt care that much. I dunno.

He seemed busy working on a lino-cut or something. So much for being a sad sack of shit. I was too happy that screen finally worked.
I left at 3:10 so I could get to work on time. Didn‚Äôt even say bye. Ugh.

I need to start on my power project. Should have started Sunday or at least Monday. Fink said my project idea was really good before I left. I denied it, but he seemed to like it, he even made sure I read the sticky note he left in my sketchbook yesterday.

I‚Äôm gonna at least take a photo tomorrow and start sketching. SHIT. We don‚Äôt have school Friday. Ughhh. I need to figure shit out now. I want to come up with a cool design for a screen before Thursday so I have an excuse to stay after school. BUT, I need to use his spray glue for my project. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh. Maybe I can do both???

I need time to think every day. This is my outlet.

Today sucked. Fink messaged me this morning about the screen printing issues. Later in zine club he said he was losing sleep over the issue. I think this thing is really troubling him. We just need a power washer hookup in the classroom and all our problems would be solved. I spent some time this morning watching videos. I came up with a list of all possible problems and emailed it to him in 7th hour.

I felt kind of numb all day. I want Fink to know what the fuck is wrong with me. I need someone REAL to know about my pain. I sound so weird. I‚Äôm so sick of talking and thinking about this. I‚Äôve been thinking about this since the school year started. Jeez. BUT I HAD MY FUCKING SHOT TODAY AND BLEW IT. To be fair he asked me if I was okay in front of all of zine club. He came over and asked if I was okay, I said yeah I‚Äôm fine, he asked if I was just tired or long day I just nodded gloomily and rushed out of the classroom. I didn‚Äôt even get to sit on the stairs and wait because dad was here already.

Auggie just talked about trans shit the whole time. I hate that that‚Äôs all who he is. Just a trans kid. Nothing more. It‚Äôs all he talks about and frankly is annoying. Zine club is just trans club now.

But I was actually sad. Wasn‚Äôt just faking it. Partly, but I really felt like shit.

I worked for 2 hours for alex. Took a walk down to the grocery store later on.

When I got home from school I just laid flat on my bed and cried. I want to do that now. I probably will when I‚Äôm done with this. Just turn the lights down low, play some purple pilgrims, and think. Because I don‚Äôt get enough time to think. Maybe that‚Äôs good, I tend to overthink, but I feel unprepared and anxious when I can‚Äôt have time to think and relax.

I just fucking deleted what I had written and now I‚Äôll do it all over again. Ugh.

I don‚Äôt know if I want to. I feel like I should though.

That dream fucked with me bad. I keep thinking she‚Äôs not dead. The word dead doesn‚Äôt mean anything anymore. She‚Äôs not coming back ever. EVER. I‚Äôll never see her again not even in the afterlife. She‚Äôs just a memory now.

Grandma asked if I wanted anything ordered. I discovered a cool deckle edge ripper I thought was super neat. I got two, one for me, and one for Fink because I thought he‚Äôd find it really cool and useful. Plus I just want to pay him back for all the work he‚Äôs done for me.

Alex asked me to cover her shift Monday 4-7. I don‚Äôt want to, but I will because I‚Äôm her friend. I‚Äôll probably call and ask if I can do 5-7 so I can still make it to zine club. I want to make a zine for once so I have something to show for myself. Something simple, about spring or something. I want to start on my drawing tomorrow too, but I‚Äôll need to take a reference photo of myself.

It rained tonight. It was beautiful. The air at work smelled of exhaust and fry grease. But the rain was wet and cool. I can‚Äôt wait for thunderstorms even though we don‚Äôt have a porch anymore which sucks.

It‚Äôs almost been a year since she died. Just a few more months. I can‚Äôt believe it.

I had a dream last night. A real screwed up one. We were with dad at grammie‚Äôs house for some reason. Things happen and I discover that mom is still alive. They faked her death. I could see mom. For the first time since she died she was alive and moving and I pushed her hug away. I was disgusted and mad.

I saw mom. It felt so real. She was alive again. Fast forward and Robert came to the door or something. I only saw him for a second.

But she was alive and she looked sorry, kind of. I miss her so much. I just woke up and it‚Äôs really hard to type and I can barely cry because I‚Äôm so tired.

Almost fell asleep. I couldn‚Äôt let another day fly by. I need to write. I need to remember.

All I am anymore is an annoyance. Maybe he‚Äôs lied to himself, but I know he‚Äôs thought it. I am an annoyance. A pain in his butt. I bother him every day about something or another. Every day I‚Äôve got some question or some comment or need something from him.

I feel like garbage.

I ruined the screen. Maybe it was because of the light but I don‚Äôt think that would do anything. What keeps going wrong? Maybe it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs probably my fault, of course it‚Äôs my fault. It‚Äôs always my fault. Nothing ever works. I was so mad at myself after it didn‚Äôt work again I wanted to cry. I almost did. I‚Äôm lucky I have such amazing friends.

I didn‚Äôt finish my research. I half-assed it to show I meant to do it. But I wrote like two pages on brainstorming for my piece. I wrote ‚ÄúI want to get hit by a bus‚Äù on the page after. I kind of hope he doesn‚Äôt see it even though I did when I wrote it. I crossed it out, but I think he can still read it. Even drew a little person in front of a bus. Just a stupid thing. A joke. It‚Äôs all a joke. I‚Äôm the joke. I‚Äôm the one to laugh at. A pathetic sack of sad shit who wishes she was dead.

Today I finally realized something I didn‚Äôt want to believe, something I didn‚Äôt think was true. He‚Äôs like my second father in a way. What I said before was a lie I wanted to believe. But today I wished I was his family. I wished I grew up with him as my father in some other life. He‚Äôs perfect. Absolutely in every way. No doubt about it. He‚Äôs got it all. And I‚Äôm in his way. I‚Äôm always in his way. But I want to be in his way because he‚Äôll notice me. I want to be noticed. I know he notices me. He does. I wish I could read his thoughts. Am I annoying to him? That‚Äôs all I wonder about. All I think about is going to class. And on the weekends, all I can think about is going to class. It‚Äôs all his class. Sometimes it‚Äôs not about him. I love my friends so much. They just happen to be in his class. The environment he‚Äôs created is perfect, of course.

And I just wish I‚Äôd be hit by a bus. And die.

Rest of the day was like any other Friday I‚Äôll never remember. It‚Äôs okay, we have to have days like that, but I hate em. After work I went on a walk with dad. I wanted to go alone to listen to music but I ended up walking with him and listening to a sermon in Matthew 1. Take that A, I finally ‚Äúread‚Äù my bible. Great. Now I‚Äôm doing it out of spite. Screw you A. I love you but not when you know my secrets.

R invited me over tomorrow but of course I work. Alex asked me to cover her Monday night. I don‚Äôt want to, but I should. I need the money but I don‚Äôt want to work.

I wanted to properly sulk today but didn‚Äôt get a real chance. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm crying to my reddit diary. This stupid little diary I feel compelled to write in daily. I don‚Äôt know if I do it because I want to remember my life, or if I need to write to sort my emotions. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit of both. Maybe my future self is reading this right now.

Forgot to write last night, but I got some stuff done. Yesterday was a lot of work. I stepped on the scale yesterday. I‚Äôve lost 11 pounds! I‚Äôm literally so happy. I look in the mirror and I don‚Äôt see any difference though. I feel the same as when I started. Whatever. But it‚Äôs hard starving myself. I feel kind of sick all the time but not.

The field trip was a lot of fun. Met a cool photographer named Kirk. He was rad. We pretty much just walked around downtown and took photos of trash.

Church sucked. A. kept asking me how my bible reading was going. I didn‚Äôt lie. It didn‚Äôt. I HAVE to start today.

I started working on a T-shirt design. I drew a frog. I‚Äôll do something in photoshop with it later this morning.

I hate you, but as I sit in my sunlit room I can help but be reminded of sunny, good times with you.

Today im mostly reminded of our earlier days. The phone calls, messages, the way we talked shit to each other, how you made my heart flutter.. now you make my stomach sink, everyday.

I now think that its very possible that you've already forgotten me, that you're entranced by her.

I hope she hurts you.

I missed uni today because of you, again.

I went home early yesterday with tears in my eyes because of you, again.

I hope karma comes for you, although I question if you even really did anything wrong by me.

I wonder if this is my karma.

I used to bleed for you

yesterday I bled because of you, again

you keep coming back, but you never do

you haunt me so much

your person, your ghost

yesterday marks the 1 month mark of you not being mine, I wanted to be okay by now, maybe if you had stopped haunting me I would have been.

guess you move fast huh

guess I was a phase

I wonder if you lied

early mornings remind me of you

rainy nights and trolley rides remind me of you

days with erratic extreme weather remind me of you

those have been plentiful as of late, how cruel

remember that day I didn't go to work? you know why I didn't right?

our phone call was too compelling, captivating

that day you talked me into travelling to bondi

it went from swelteringly hot to hailing ferociously

I always wondered if that meant something

train rides hurt now

remember how you used to watch me?

you wished you could have someone like me

I feel that now

and I now know that to you I was just a moment

short and fleeting

filled with ferocious hail

and next to her

I truly pale

I‚Äôve lost weight!  I stepped on the scale after not eating anything but a granola bar all day. 223.6 pounds. That‚Äôs almost 10 pounds less than when I started! I kind of noticed my double chin had been going away very slowly, it doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äúhang‚Äù anymore, if you could call it that. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs working. I feel so much better about myself! I took a picture and compared it to my old one after I cut my bangs. My face shape seems less round near the bottom. I‚Äôm worried that when I lose more weight, the upper part of my head will stay that wide and I‚Äôll look like a gnome or something. But for now, I feel prettier. I know 10 pounds is barely anything. But the fact that I can tell a difference is really something. If I can lose 3-4 pounds a week, I‚Äôll have lost 30 pounds by the time school ends. If I keep this up during the summer. I‚Äôll weigh 170 pounds when school starts. That‚Äôs 60 pounds less, and totally do-able. I refuse to call it anorexia because I have control over it unlike those with anorexia. I can stop any time.

I guess if I‚Äôm going to lose so much weight I should probably hold off on buying clothes until the school year starts again. Or at lest until I can‚Äôt fit in my jeans anymore.

I‚Äôm trying to ignore the rumbles of my stomach. I ate three granola bars, and a whole ass bag of skinny pop. That puts me at at LEAST 1,000 cals for the day. I can do better though. I want to buy some more oranges because they are SO filling and SO low calorie.

Anyways, enough with my weight loss crap. I‚Äôve got a field trip tomorrow. One I shouldn‚Äôt technically even be going on. It‚Äôs for Fink‚Äôs photo class. The week before spring break he was giving someone a field trip form I thought was for the one we had rescheduled and I asked for one. He handed me one and said it was for the photo field trip, but I could come if I really wanted. It was kind of a joke but I didn‚Äôt know if he was being serious or not. I asked him today if he was just joking or if he was serious and he said I could come. I‚Äôm so excited. I feel a little strange about going, like I don‚Äôt quite belong.

Either way, log and Jean will be there so at least I‚Äôll have some friends. I don‚Äôt know whether to bring my analog camera or ask Fink to let me borrow a digital one. I don‚Äôt really like analog, and I only have one roll of film. But on the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to be an annoyance and ask for a digital camera early in the morning.

I finished my VF class today. Now it‚Äôs officially my study hall and my teacher from hell had no excuse to complain when I‚Äôm not doing work. Thank god. We started the Great Gatsby in English today too.

I hope tomorrow isn‚Äôt a trainwreck. I feel like I‚Äôm back in October again, but this time things are more different. Ugh, I should stop being so pessimistic and have a great Wednesday tomorrow. I just hope the weather doesn‚Äôt suck.

I need to start on that art project. Actually, I need to start on two. I should do that tomorrow. "

Today I finally got all my stuff straightened out for my surgery.

Yesterday I was told it was going to be in April, then today I was told it was going to be in May lol. Also I was told I was going to be discharged the day of my surgery, then later I was told I was going to be in the hospital for 3 days.

All I gotta do is get my ride situation straightened out because I can't drive home, I need to recover.

I'm going to be on temporary 6 week disability and also call off work for those 6 weeks. All I need to do is drop by the gyn's office (call them ahead of time so they can get the letter ready for my workplace) and then submit it so HR can process it and know I'll be gone for a while for medical reasons.

My birthday will be a week after my surgery so I can't eat good that time haha. I wanted to celebrate with my coworkers because I never actually did celebrate with them, I was always going out of town.

Just thinking about it, it has been a very hard road. I went through a whole lot to get to this point. I'm glad things are finally at the point where they know what's going on and it's going to be dealt with. All I have to worry about is surgery and recovery.

For months I just didn't know what was going on with me and my old doctor just was so bad at helping me. And my problem isn't unique at all, women just tend to not get taken seriously. Women's health isn't taken that seriously because it's assumed that we exaggerate. I'm young, 28 years old, I can walk and talk normally, etc like your average healthy person. So because of that I was treated like I was exaggerating my pelvic issues... I'm extremely glad I changed to a new doctor and they have been so great at getting me help and examinations.

It was very hard to talk about just a couple of months ago. Now I can talk about it candidly and in a nonchalant manner, but it's still a pretty huge deal. I don't talk about this stuff looking for attention at all, I don't complain about my health unless I'm in a lot of pain. I talk about it so work knows my situation and also because people care and wonder how I'm doing. But yeah. This has dragged on long enough since I just wasn't sure if I was ready to get my ovary removed, but honestly I'm okay for now.

People still ask if I'm hurting and not really, the worst has passed since I managed it. The worst pain was my prolapse, which I fixed with exercise. And I've been more careful ever since to avoid getting to that point again. That prolapse lasted for months... so traumatizing to not know what was going on with me and to be treated like I was exaggerating it. That I solved it all by myself, thanks to the advice of another redditor actually. I'm thankful for their advice, it really helped me a lot.

Anyway, I'll see if I update again. I tend to use this account to talk about my health issues. Hopefully everything goes well in the end."

Today was good, today was great even.
Woke up and wanted to kill myself because I didn‚Äôt get things done. Maybe if I start finishing my homework in the evening I won‚Äôt wake up every morning wanting to die. Just a thought.

School was boring and normal as hell until lunch. Jake sat with us at lunch which was pretty odd. He‚Äôs kinda cute he just has such a different personality. We got our new art project assigned today. ‚ÄúArt & Power‚Äù the question asked was what do you feel like has power over you, or what do you feel like you have power over? As usual I had NO idea. But he mentioned something about college, and that sparked something in me that gave me ideas. I want to make a large Kymia Nawabi esque drawing about what I feel like my life should look like 10 years from now according to my family and church. Something along those lines, I have ideas, but they are purely visual and hard to write about. I want to get started sketching tomorrow.

I didn‚Äôt talk to Fink once during 6th or 7th hour, not even in club until the very end. I was kinda bummed, until he was about to shut down the darkroom and he asked me if I‚Äôve turned in my projects and got caught up with that. I got all nervous and stressed, and just honestly told him that I was switching out one of them for something I made a while back for fun, and that the other one I‚Äôd have done tonight and I‚Äôd send him a picture. Then we were about to leave the dark room and he‚Äôs like Oh BTW, you got picked for the PTA scholarship of 300$ and I was completely shocked. I didn‚Äôt know what to say at first. I felt like my reaction was pretty bland but I didn‚Äôt fully realize yet that I‚Äôd been given 300$. I didn‚Äôt even know he wrote them for me. He didn‚Äôt even tell me. It‚Äôs one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. Even f it‚Äôs not HIS money, he spent all that time and effort into writing something to the PTA to get me that $$$.

He‚Äôs literally the best person in the world. I left and sat down on the stairs outside and he waved as he drove by. I felt like I didn‚Äôt express my thanks to him enough, and I never will be able to fully, but I wrote him a message saying how thankful I was, and that it was just the amount I needed. But that‚Äôs the thing.. it WAS the amount I needed. Perfectly. Except I didn‚Äôt want to tell him my grandparents are paying for all but 300$ of the price. Especially after how much drama I made over never being able to pay for it. I feel bad, but I don‚Äôt for some strange reason. All I can say is that it‚Äôs a miracle. I basically was given a full ride to the camp between my grandparents and the PTA. Praise God.

After school my sister and I walked down to the grocery store and bought some low-cal food. Popcorn, granola bars, and two oranges. Because it‚Äôs orange season according to Fink. We sat outside on the curb peeling and eating our oranges. They were so filling and tasty and only like 70 calories. I should have bought more. Maybe later this week.

I‚Äôm so excited. But I feel a little overwhelmed right now. I just need a workspace. Then I can start being organized and have a plan. That‚Äôs my next money spending goal, to design a studio space that can fit into my room.

Anyways. I finished my night drawing and posted it to Instagram tonight. Fink liked it. He asked if I had ever done a night scene before. I was looking back over my timeline as a whole and I didn‚Äôt realize how many landscapes I make. I don‚Äôt like to say, ‚ÄúLandscapes are my thing‚Äù but the pictures don‚Äôt lie. I want to get away from landscapes for a bit and focus more on space, figure, texture, and color.


I feel organized in my messy little life, in my messy little room. I feel like I‚Äôm gaining control for once. I can have a mental breakdown later. Right now I just need to get shit done. "

the drama at work simmer down but im still out of my boss's circle. it still hurts but im numb to the pain.  my st.patrick day was okay. another plain day at work.

today i will be starting school. this is the first time going back to school since 2012 when i graduated high school. i hope i do well. im feeling excited about it. i know the excitement will last until i come across something thats fucked up. i discovered there are more websites that offer courses on the i.t support certificate. they are claiming that you can get your i.t certificate in 8 months. the lady on the phone when i registered for class did mentioned something about it being accelerated so i might get done sooner. with a certificate i can find an entry-level job in the i.t field. i also want to know if this is the career i want to do. i hope i didnt pick the wrong program.  either way i want something good out of all of this. only problem is i didnt tell my brother and sister in law. i don't know how they would feel about me going to college. even though its online. i just hope they would be ok with it. i been wanting to go back to school and this is my chance.

I‚Äôm so excited to go back to school, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying that after how much I wanted to just sleep in another week. Fink actually seems excited about the new quarter! I hope this ones gonna be a good one. I‚Äôm looking forward to new projects. He actually liked my crappy texture project which I can‚Äôt believe. But I don‚Äôt know what other people did for theirs.

He said, ‚ÄúHa ha!! It‚Äôs a cacophonous riot revolt of color. I love it! It‚Äôs like free form funkified punk jazz when you‚Äôre used to acoustic guitar and voice. Both are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs different but I like that you snuck your own quiet poetry in there. Beautiful.‚Äù

He‚Äôs so kind. And he uses my name too, which is something so seemingly insignificant but it really means a lot to me for some reason. I don‚Äôt know what my own quiet poetry is, maybe the stamp or my tiny textures. Who knows. But he likes even the shitty stuff I make. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so great.

My stepmom found my blades today. I don‚Äôt know if she realized what they were, but she was doing my laundry and they were in my pocket. Just three tiny pencil sharpener blades. She might not even realize what I use them for, but there‚Äôs a good chance she knows, she just doesn‚Äôt want to confront me about it. I cut out some words on paper using them. If anyone asks, my first excuse is that I couldn‚Äôt find an exacto knife to cut paper, and if they see through that, I‚Äôll tell them I cut myself on my arm. Which only has a handful of cuts. They can never know about my thighs. Ever. Even I can barely look at them.

I really need to draw but I don‚Äôt want to. I just want to sleep. I have to get that sky drawing done tonight, AND a whole new one. On top of that, I‚Äôll have to finish my research tomorrow. AND SHIT, I didn‚Äôt come up with any zines. I hate myself. I hope I don‚Äôt disappoint Fink too much.

My sister is in the hospital because she fell when roller skating and her glasses cut deep into her forehead, and she might have hurt her arm. They left over three hours ago and I haven‚Äôt heard much. Been watching the x-files since and decided I should probably go to bed even though I‚Äôm wide awake. I‚Äôve had this weird headache all day and part of yesterday which I believe to be due to a lack of sleep, or lack of a consistent sleep schedule. I don‚Äôt really wanna deal with a headache tomorrow, I have too many art projects I need to finish up. Leave it to me to leave it to the last day possible.

I worked a 10 hour day and don‚Äôt even feel like it. It‚Äôs amazing what a good shower and some tv can do. I went a bit over my calorie limit today. I need to stop. I need to have self control. I need to lose weight, not just for others, but for myself. If I lost weight, people would notice. Maybe Fink would. I wonder what he would say, if anything. If I lose a ton of weight before next school year, I‚Äôm sure to get some sort of comment from him. I don‚Äôt know why I care that he would care. I‚Äôm so weird. I guess I just want attention, praise, that‚Äôs all I ever want. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted from anyone, especially him. I don‚Äôt need praise from peers, never have. I just want praise from adults. He just happens to be one of the only adults I enjoy being around.

I‚Äôm pretty sick, but at least I can be honest with myself. I know what I want, I know what I need. I don‚Äôt like that, but it is what it is. I don‚Äôt mean to sound so nonchalant about my creepy obsessions, I‚Äôm just so used to me being a creep, I‚Äôve come to terms with it.

But is it really creepy? Am I truly a .. creep? Is being obsessed with your high school art teacher creepy? Not obsessed in a .. I want to murder, or I‚Äôm in love with, but am obsessed more like... I desperately need attention because I feel so lonely and the only attention I care about is his because a. he‚Äôs an adult male and apparently I have father issues. b. he actually cares about me and my art. c. HE‚Äôs an amazing artist, person, teacher, everything. He‚Äôs practically perfect in every way. Ugh. The way I word everything makes it sound creepy. Guess I‚Äôm just in a weird mood right now. I just wish he knew how much he has impacted my life and how much he means to me. That‚Äôs all I want, is for him to know I care back, that he deserves the utmost thanks.

I should go to bed, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll fall asleep. I‚Äôll probably wake up here in the next hour when they get home from the hospital. They‚Äôre glueing her forehead back together as I type.  "

I struggle with understanding why self-harm is so heavily frowned upon. I understand that it's not the most healthy coping mechanism but neither is drinking and plenty of people condone that.

Do I want my friends to self-harm? No. Why? I hope they're not in a dark place that would lead them to feelings that self-harm would potentially alleviate - even if just temporarily. Myself? I don't care if I do it. I don't think it's all that bad and I have a hard time convincing myself otherwise.

If someone understands the risk and does what they should to mitigate those risks why is it so bad?

Maybe I‚Äôve tricked myself into believing I need other people to be happy, to feel alive. Maybe that‚Äôs not the case anymore. I‚Äôve felt perfectly fine these last few days without people, I mean, except for my family. Countless times I‚Äôve written about school and how much I need it, how much it keeps me going and happy. But 80% of the time I end up crying as soon as I leave Fink‚Äôs room because of how stupid I am. Maybe it‚Äôs really not all that healthy for me. I don‚Äôt know.

It feels weird not feeling. I‚Äôm so used to a rollercoaster of emotions every single day. Today and yesterday and Tuesday and Wednesday were so.. plain. Nothing bad happened, and nothing overwhelmingly good. EXCEPT, my art camp is paid for. My grandparents gave me a card with a letter telling me they‚Äôd help pay for camp. The communication was bad on their part and I didn‚Äôt understand what they offered me until the car ride home from lunch. They‚Äôre paying for 2,300$. THATS a lot of fucking money. I‚Äôm going! It‚Äôs real! I need to slap myself because it feels like a dream. The excitement hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet and it‚Äôs been over 24 hours. I don‚Äôt know why. I think my emotions broke and I‚Äôve been feeling kinda blank all week.

Boom. It‚Äôs settled. So many hours of working so hard and worrying so much. It‚Äôs taken care of. Jeez.

I wanna buy nice clothes for the camp. I wanna be stylish. I really want some dr. Martens sandals and boots, and I reallllly want a pair of these top shop jeans. Maybe that‚Äôs too overboard? I need to learn to be content. I don‚Äôt like standing out, never have. I don‚Äôt know why all of the sudden I want to. If I wanna stand out at this camp, I‚Äôll wear normal clothes. I‚Äôll be a normal kid. But if I lose weight... these pants are so cute. They‚Äôre almost a 10 hour days worth of work, but they‚Äôre so cool. I wanna look cute, I wanna be pretty, I just need to lose weight. I went almost 350 calories over my limit today. I know it‚Äôs not a TON, but it‚Äôs more than I wanted to. I‚Äôm only eating two chicken sandwiches and two apple sauces tomorrow. That‚Äôs it. A nice, even, 880 calories. Maybe ONE egg for lunch.

I need to be patient. Now that I have 2,300$ I don‚Äôt need to worry about, I should really save it. Maybe for a car, maybe for college, or maybe for a new desk. I should really focus on having a nice space to create rather than buying 90$ jeans. I could pretty much buy the table top for that price. Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna go watch tv and drink water.

I hate my consumeristic mind. But I really hate my desk. "

It's been a few months since my last post.

I had been waiting a long time to get approved for surgery. Turns out it was miscommunication or some weird thing going on between my insurance, my doctor, and gynecologist.

I'd call my insurance and they said that they closed my doctor's request to return to my gynecologist because they didn't state that I had seen my second opinion (which did nothing to ask for surgery) and the reason why I wanted to go back (which was to get surgery). That went on for about a month. One week of waiting for the second opinion, 2 weeks of waiting to go back to my gyn. I had finally just went to my doctor in person to get my authorization letter, which they printed out for me... so I waited 2 weeks for nothing. Turns out my gynecologist had also made a request for me to see them (I had also called them as well). And then another month of actually seeing my gyn in a new appointment. And now, another month of seeing my gyn again to probably tell me how to prepare for my surgery. The wait is always long...

I got my letter from my insurance telling me which hospital I'd be going to. I looked them up on yelp (yelp reviews are extremely helpful!) and the hospital I'm going to has a really low rating... that's really not a good sign, so I'm kind of wary but I have no choice. I hope they don't give me a hard time or make my stay terrible. Or worse... neglect me and I end up with worse complications.

Also my surgery, from what the gynecologist told me, is going to be like a C-section. So he's going to cut me open, take out my fibroid cyst (and any other cysts he sees if they popped up in the past few months), and also take out my ovary and the tube attached to it (because the ovary was replaced by a dermoid cyst, in this case it was referred to as a tumor).

I'm really hoping for the best. I am very worried about my recovery process, considering that I don't have the most caring people around me who can't be there to help me and can't be there 24/7. I've never had surgery, and that I have to take precautions to not have complications... It's overwhelming to have an ovary removed and go all through this stuff for sure.

I had been complaining about pain for the longest time and I am finally getting help at this point at last. It was a long and arduous road. I'm thankful I finally got a good doctor and that my doctor has good staff. They're really on top of things and are very nice. I wish I encountered more nice people in the healthcare industry like them more. My previous doctor and the staff were terribly rude and uncaring.

Anyway, I hope I can make it out of this 90% better at least. I'm getting closer... and I'm nervous. Deep breaths. Maybe when this is all over, I'll come back and talk about my experience."

so much has occurred. i couldn't get the words out so im gonna wing it like i always do.

i got my state and tax returns. i saved some of it but i ended up spending it. i bought a nintendo switch with pokemon let's go Pikachu. i was so happy and excited until my sister in law noticed and had a serious talk about how its silly and immature for a guy my age to drop $300 on a game console and that its half of the amount of a rent on a apartment. she told me to look up the cost of a 1 bedroom place and they ranged from $600-800. once she saw how shocked i was at the price, she told me that its not cheap to live on my own and that i need a full time job. i could use the full time job.

at work, somehow i got myself involved in another drama.  schedules came out and i had more hours than someone and when i asked my boss about giving up a day, she said no. later on she texted me saying she took a day away from me and i said okay whatever. another co-worker that i always talked to and good friends with told me someone i had seniority over had more hours. i come to work to talk to my boss about it and she told me that the co-worker i always talked to which i will now call maria needs to mind her own business. she say that because maria is known as the gossip queen and likes to know everyone's personal business and looks at people's schedules to see how many hours they got. my job is part of a union so each time someone below her in seniority has more hours than her, she would call the union and my boss would get so angry at her. maria also tend to be rude sometimes. my boss then told me i was gullible and that i always fall for her to problems and listens to her too much which is true. she told me before to stay away from maria but i didnt listen. my boss was saying how everyone at work noticed how tight me and maria are and think we are dating. maria is 57 and im 25. she is tooo old for me and plus im gay. i feel so embarrassed now. my phone kept going off with messages from maria and my boss took my  phone and read my messages from her. my boss who i will call Lynnette exploded and got really angry saying that she was sooo sick of maria and that she is done trying to persuade me from talking to her. she also told me she will no longer talk to me about things other than work and that im no longer her adopted son. she has a circle of people she is close to at work and i got kicked out of that circle.  i didnt explain the story well enough but just know that i lost my boss's trust and im no longer in that circle. it hurts inside because me and Lynnette always had a good working relationship and she is a mother figure to me.  i feel nothing but guilt eating at me. because of this i stopped texting maria. she keeps texting but im not gonna respond. i now realize maria is nothing but a problem. now im just gonna keep to myself.

the being gullible part is true. i fall for every little thing and i get the brunt of the result. people use me all the time and i never realized it until the damage is done. why do i have to be so fucking stupid? im a fucking idiot.

now i have no one to talk to and no dating app to use. im lonely and horny.  i feel so many emotions right now i don't know what to do. i wish i could scream but my voice is too weak. i just want to scream for once. i want the voice other people have.

And the things I hate about my dad, like how easy going he is, is actually his strength and something I lack. I need to be more ‚Äúchill.‚Äù I totally overthink something.

I get all mad at them, then myself, and one thing leads to another and in just ten minutes I‚Äôve already come to terms with never talking to them ever again, then I realize, what the heck me? Like this whole drama about the art camp. Ugh, I could have saved myself so much stress if I would have just trusted God. I know how ridiculous that sounds, but so much peace comes from trusting god instead of myself. At the end of the day, at the end of my emotional messes, at the end of my short lived fantasies,and unrealistic plans for my life, He‚Äôs been there. And I‚Äôve ignored him. Why did I turn my back on the truth, there is ONE truth, and I know that at the very core of my soul. I need to trust God, but right now it feels like the equivalent of me suddenly showing up at Audrey‚Äôs door and saying I want to be friends again, it just seems so absurd. Obviously I‚Äôve been lacking knowledge of the character of God, but jeez. I don‚Äôt regret anything honestly. I do, but I don‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now. I like the struggle. Sometimes sanctification scares me. I just wanna be a mess right now. My soul feeds off my emotional stresses and drama and it‚Äôs kind of gross. I don‚Äôt know. This all came back to me suddenly. I‚Äôm so impacted by the people I‚Äôm around. I guess this is what happens when I‚Äôve been at church so often lately.

Anyways, I‚Äôm kind of pissed of said church conference because I didn‚Äôt get the stuff I needed to get done tonight, but we wouldn‚Äôt have talked in the living room for hours if we didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs all the butterfly effect. I need to get my art work done. I ordered some easy carve off of amazon and it should be here Thursday and I‚Äôm super excited. I don‚Äôt know what to make! I have a rough idea with birds kind of. Who knows, this is just a test really.

Laura is going to be home for the rest of the week instead of at work. I‚Äôm excited. I love her so much, it‚Äôs so nice to have a different personality besides dad. He‚Äôs just so.. unstressed, and it kind of makes me stressed knowing he‚Äôs not concerned with anything. I‚Äôm a mess.

Today I felt kind of pretty for a split second. After I got home from work and took my hair down. It kind of waved and my bangs were parted in the middle and flowed into my hair. I kind of wonder if I should grow them out. I‚Äôd look a lot older if I would. You know what? I‚Äôll do it! By the time camp rolls around they‚Äôll be at the perfect length. Sweet, now I‚Äôm losing weight, growing my nails out, AND my hair. Wow. I feel so much like an adult. Which I WILL be in a year and two months. AGH. THATS SO SOON. I‚Äôm not ready for life, but if I reflect back on how much I change in a year, I‚Äôll be fine.

Moral of today: I need to start trusting God more. My life is not my own. I am broken.

Break me Lord. You tried with mom over summer but even that couldn‚Äôt break my wall. I‚Äôm tired of fighting. I give up.

Amen."

Alrighty, time for another post. Her and I were intimate the other day for the first time in over half a year I'd say. So that's very exciting. I did have some issues this morning and yesterday morning as well with thinking about it too much and making some bad decisions (with some bad thoughts popping up and me continuing for a while). I still have some anxieties and stuff with bad thoughts or checking people out ect but I am trying to just not let them effect me and not worry about it so as to just let them pass and not get fixated on it. Like, I know I would never cheat on Her again. But I will have a bad thought of something like that, but I know I wouldn't. I couldn't hurt Her like that again, largely because I think the anxiety of it all would actually kill me. Then I wonder if I am correct though, like, if put in the situation where I could what would I do? I feel I wouldn't. More importantly, I am not going to do anything that would put me into a position where that is possible. I feel some anxiety now. I gotta relax and not think about things."

I didn‚Äôt realize how out of control my self harm was/is. Jeez. I started comparing my cuts to others and I realized I cut a lot more than most people who do, just not as deep as some. I wish I could do deep, but I‚Äôm too scared. I‚Äôd rather not.

The missionaries wife shared her testimony today. She struggled really badly with depression and self harm in her youth. Like really bad, and I want to talk to her, part of me does. But obviously I can‚Äôt. That isn‚Äôt an option. An anonymous email maybe, but even then, people would figure out by deduction it was me.

I freaked the hell out last night. My sister wrote my a note telling me she found my blades and threw them away, it was a sweet letter, but it put me into a mild panic attack. The guys on the discord server helped calm me down and think rationally, but man, I wanted to cut so bad. I really let her down. I‚Äôm a bad sister. I sure hope to god she never tells dad.

I look down and feel the hundreds of scars and cuts on my leg and just get sad. Why did I do this to myself? I know why, but WHY?

I want to bruise again. But I need a reason. It just doesn‚Äôt work without extreme self hatred. I need to screw up in front of Fink or something. That always does the trick. I feel like utter garbage when I do something not perfect around him. I feel like a stupid failure. I hate it when I can‚Äôt find the right words. I hate it when I don‚Äôt make enough art. I hate myself. I wish I could be like him, with wise words that flow freely, never saying the wrong thing. Words flow from him like a stream down a mountain. When we did the radio show, words just poured out straight from the flames of passion of his heart. He has so much passion for his craft and his work. And passion for caring for us students.

I want to make art he likes, not just art he appreciates, art he loves. I know how to do that. I just don‚Äôt know HOW, I mean, physically. I‚Äôm a bad photographer. While I LOVE his taste in alternative photography and printmaking and art in general, I just am bad at that type of thing. I am more precise in my work. That‚Äôs just how I roll. I just want to find a style of art that comes naturally that Fink likes, and that I can show to my family and friends without seeming dark and disturbing. Whatever. I‚Äôll figure it out.

Today I just realized how far in the year it is. ITS MARCH! I only have till December to create a bomb portfolio. Oh god. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Invited River over tomorrow to make cookies! That should be fun! She‚Äôs such a great person.

It feels so wrong not to be so overtly sad. I don‚Äôt like this numb life. It‚Äôs not numb, bad, but it‚Äôs not great, good. It‚Äôs like a taste in my mouth that doesn‚Äôt taste bad, but I wish would go away.  I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm trying to explain here other than that I wish that my emotions weren‚Äôt so plain. I feel like my father. Ew. He‚Äôs always so plain all the time. I don‚Äôt think he has the capacity to be excited or sad, or even mad anymore. That‚Äôs a nice thing, but it also sucks not having someone to be excited for your accomplishments. I don‚Äôt know how my sister can vent to him all the time. I mean, he provides some pretty solid solutions, but they aren‚Äôt always the solutions I WANT to hear. Guess that means I‚Äôm just a self-centered little cunt or something. I need to stop talking about him. I literally don‚Äôt care about him. Why do I care so much. He‚Äôs just kind of there. At least he‚Äôs reliable, I have that much at least.

I found a pretty sweet self-harm discord server last night. God, I wish I‚Äôd had that last year. Everyone seems really nice and supportive. But I don‚Äôt want supportive sometimes. Life sucks, people suck, we just gotta come to terms with that. I just spent some time telling a guy to not hate himself for not doing a good enough job calming his friend down. Then I proceeded to get mad at myself for not doing good enough to calm him down. I guess we can only control our own emotions. I‚Äôm glad I got off discord. Probably one of the better decisions I‚Äôve made. I don‚Äôt necessary regret anything (except HIM), because it‚Äôs made me a more laid back, and tougher individual. But man, I wish I‚Äôd spent more time connecting with.. I dunno.. people I see in a daily basis. Sometimes I think about HIM and I wonder what happened. Where did I go wrong to do what I did? I won‚Äôt even talk about what happened even to myself. I don‚Äôt want to even think about it. I hate myself for caring. Frank Sinatra still makes me think of him, but even more, that time I was sitting outside of the movie theatre because mom bought the wrong tickets to go see my favorite movie. ‚ÄúMy way‚Äù was playing in the theatre I was sitting outside of for some Kingsman trailer or something, and boy oh boy, that hit me hard. It was like I was an ice cream cone and I got dipped upside down into a chocolate bucket of intense emotions.

God, I really did used to hate her so much. I feel like a traitor to my former self for romanticizing my relationship with mom. She was kind of a shitty mom at times. Actually, for most of the time. It wasn‚Äôt until the last year or so of her life I started tolerating her, and even, dare I say, loving her. And it hurts so much.

...

Just listened to ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù for old times sake. Really regretting that. Suddenly I was a freshman again, it was spring. I was sleeping at moms alone for some reason. It was raining out, the orange glow of the streetlight poured through the blinds. I‚Äôm sitting on my sisters bed because she has the better bed with the blankets. I can see the whole room around me. It‚Äôs like a photo. I‚Äôm texting the guys or rob or someone on discord. Then suddenly I‚Äôm at the movie theatre. I‚Äôm holding my knees close to my chest as I watch from the floor as mom tries to get more tickets to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2. ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù is blaring from the open doors to the theatre. I want to die. [https://prnt.sc/mw4304](https://prnt.sc/mw4304) I forgot about this photo. This was it. That time in the theatre. I don‚Äôt feel any emotion looking at it anymore for some reason. I just feel kind of numb again.

I miss her so much. I miss that part of my life that died. It was kinda shitty, but it was MINE. I just want her phone. I know this sounds awful, but I hope grandad or Grammy keels over and leaves me moms ashes and phone and her shit. I just want moms photos. Is that too much to ask? I want her audio recordings and videos because I can‚Äôt hear her voice anymore. It‚Äôs gone. She‚Äôs gone. She fades from my life and I don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs gone. She‚Äôs so lost and so am I. I feel like I‚Äôm fishing for memories that won‚Äôt stick. Nothing does. Nothing is fair. I miss her more than anyone or anything. AND NO ONE KNOWS. Even my sister knows about my self harm, BUT NOT A SOUL KNOWS ABOUT HOW MUCH I MISS MOM. NO ONE AT SCHOOL KNOWS SHE DIED OVER THE SUMMER AND NO ONE CARES. But why should they? They didn‚Äôt know her. No one fucking did. I‚Äôm the only person on earth who KNEW my mom. Her parents might have raised her, but she was a different person as my mother. I died with her. Half of ME is gone. Genetically, and just my daily life. No more outings, weird adventures, exploring, nothing. No more lunches with the grandparents while we awkwardly sit in their expensive mansion. No more Louie, no more birds, no more anything, nothing at all. It‚Äôs all gone.

And the worst part about all of this is. I don‚Äôt have a grave to dramatically cry over. I DONT EVEN HAVE HER ASHES. WHAT THE HELL??? SHE WAS MY MOM MORE THAN SHE WAS YOUR DAUGHTER. SHE PROBABLY SITS IN SOME VASE SOMEWHERE. BUT I WONDER, DO YOU KEEP HER ON YOUR FIREPLACE, NEXT TO SOME ANCIENT CHINESE VASE ON TOP OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MARBLE? OR DO YOU HIDR HER AWAY IN YOUR BASEMENT ALONG WITH ALL THE SHIT IVE MADE YOU OVER THE YEARS. CAN YOU NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT HER? ALL YOUR MONEY AND YOU COULDN‚ÄôT EVEN BURY HER. I HATE YOU GUYS. FUCK YOU. GIVE ME MOMS STUFF. I WANT HER PHONE. I DESERVE THAT. I WANT TO SEE LOUIE, I NEVER LIKED THAT DOG BUT FUCK, ITS ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HER. THAT DOG WAS ONE OF HER ONLY JOYS IN THIS WORLD AND ILL BE DAMNED IF YOU PUT HIM IN SOME POUND. WHAT ABOUT MY BIRDS. YEAH, MY BIRDS. DID HE KILL THEM YET? OR DID HE GET RID OF THEM. I WANT TO SEE MY BIRDS.

ALSO MOST FUCKING IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW SHE DIED. WHY?????? Why? Why? What was her cause of death? Because saying she died in her sleep means a lot of things. I DESERVE TO KNOW. I HATE BOTTLING UP THIS SHIT. I MISS HER SO BAD. FUCK YOU DAD FOR NOT CARING.

Now I just wanna die. But if I die her memories die. I want to cut myself open. I need HELP. FROM A REAL ADULT HUMAN WHO CARES. I NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP FROM SOMEONE WHO WONT TELL MY DAD. I am entitled to my emotions and they are VALID. You HEAR THAT DAD? My. Emotions. ARE. VALID!

I gotta stop ranting like a pathetic psycho. Oh god, I can‚Äôt be psychotic. But hey, if I were, at least that‚Äôs one more thing mom and I have in common."

Alright, time for a post that is just reviewing the past few days. Today was a stressful day and yesterday wasn't my best. I felt a lot of frustration that lead to bad thoughts and decisions last night and today about the lack of any sexual relationship that Her and I currently have. Idk what a sexual relationship means to me. Do I feel that it helps me build a special bond with a person?  I think so? But I could not feel that bond/connection if I wanted? Idk. I felt anxious about a coworker and edged last night to Her and felt stressed and stuff and still feel anxious today. There is a TedTalk I watched the other day that I feel like I might show Her, but I don't want to cause any issues between Her and I though and I worry it might bother Her or something. Alright, that's all for now. I need to brush my teeth and get ready for bed."

I‚Äôve come to terms with expecting a normal life. I think most people have in a way. Normal for me means a steady job that isn‚Äôt physically exhausting, being able to make and sell my art on the side, and an apartment that isn‚Äôt falling apart. That‚Äôs all I need in life to be happy. A family would be nice too, but isn‚Äôt necessary. I can accomplish this without being a high school art prodigy. However, I desperately want to go to college, and the only way I‚Äôll make it is if I get good scholarships. I need to build my brand now. Become a recognized name amongst the local art scene. Then I‚Äôm sure to get great scholarships.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this because it sounds so pretentious, and I already know this stuff by heart, but I need to remember that things will be okay. I‚Äôve always adapted to change and tragedy.

I can make it.

I just can‚Äôt help but feel guilty when I sit around all day. I know that I need to set aside days to do that without feeling guilty, but I just can‚Äôt shake the guilt.

Whatever. I‚Äôm exhausted, just worked for 10 hours on my feet. All I know is that I need a job where I‚Äôm not on my feet all day when I‚Äôm out of college.... if I go to college. "

I don‚Äôt know what to feel. I saw the notification and smiled and smiled but I feel so much guilt. I feel guilty about not being excited about going. I‚Äôm so used to pushing my hopes down low so I won‚Äôt be disappointed. I don‚Äôt even know what expectations are real anymore. I need to figure out a payment system with dad real quick or else things could get messy. I need this camp. It‚Äôll get me into college easier. It‚Äôll set me up for my future.

But I can‚Äôt help thinking, what if the teachers are shitty? What if my roommate is annoying? What if I don‚Äôt learn a single new thing? What if dad won‚Äôt let me go when he finds out there might be nude figure models? What if he won‚Äôt let me go because Milla can‚Äôt? What if I get sick? What if I can‚Äôt draw good? What if I‚Äôm not the best?

I hate myself. Why am I so anxious and paranoid? Why can‚Äôt I be a happier person? Why can‚Äôt I just be cool for once? Why am I so high maintenance? I feel the hundreds of scars beneath my pants and I wonder why I stopped. Was it boredom, or have I gotten better? All of my friends are so open about their issues and share their accomplishments with the world every day. And I‚Äôm proud of them, and I never think of them wrongly when they do. Yet whenever I put myself out there, I feel as though I‚Äôm wasting peoples time. I wish I‚Äôd learn to take a compliment. I‚Äôm trying, but it feels so unnatural.

Tomorrow I work a day of my life away. Every Saturday. Every week. Down the drain for money. Money I‚Äôve spent because I couldn‚Äôt learn contentment. But I won‚Äôt complain. I‚Äôm lucky to have my job. It‚Äôs definitely not the best possible one, but it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve known.

A shift in my life is approaching and I don‚Äôt know what it will be or how it will play out. I‚Äôve had these senses before. The last time was 6 months before mom died. I knew I‚Äôd lose someone important to me that year and I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I knew it the second I got back in the car that day. I‚Äôve got some sort of super intuition.

Things are going to change. Soon, but not too soon. I‚Äôm going to realize something about myself or life that will change everything. I can feel it. My life is some sick system of cycles inside of bigger cycles that move at different speeds and at different sizes. Everything repeats itself. We are just too blind to see. I need to track it. I need concrete proof for myself.

Things haven‚Äôt felt real lately. I feel like I‚Äôm floating through time or I‚Äôve drifted into some alternate state. I don‚Äôt feel at home in my room, I never know what day it is. The idea of work sickens me. The uncertainty of the future scares me more than anything. School felt like school today, a feeling I haven‚Äôt felt in months, even a year.

I need Fink, he takes my mind of the numbness of life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worth it.‚Äù He said. How can I be worth it? I‚Äôm worth nothing, I‚Äôm not even good enough to get even a partial scholarship to a stupid high school art camp. What does that say about me now? Am I really worth it? Or is it because I‚Äôm a kiss-ass who is obsessed with his praise and approval? Would he think the same of me if he realized how much I think of him? He‚Äôs the father figure I‚Äôve always needed. My own has left me alone with years of bottled emotions and feelings. I‚Äôm beginning to understand what mom went through. If dad knew what went on in my head he would treat me like her.

Fink doesn‚Äôt do that to me. He‚Äôs the one adult in my life who sees people from the heart instead of clouded judgement like my father. He understands empathy, the most important thing a person can have. It helps we agree on most everything when it comes to art, and he shares that same passion for it I do. He‚Äôs just had more time to make it. But he CARES. More than anyone I‚Äôve ever seen. And it‚Äôs genuine. There aren‚Äôt a lot of genuines in my life. I want to make him proud with who I am and what I create because he understands in a way my dad doesn‚Äôt.

I still think about the day I cried on the bus when we passed where we used to live and where I found out mom died. He noticed something was up and when I got back to class to grab my bags he caught me in the hallway before I left. He asked me what was wrong and I couldn‚Äôt tell him the full truth. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to tell him. I just said it was hard going by there and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù a hundred times like an idiot. And then he hugged me. And it was the first time I‚Äôd felt safe and understood since mom died. He will never know how much I needed that hug. He will never know how much he means to me and I hate myself for not expressing my gratitude enough.

He saved me. I had hit rock bottom by December. My self harm was at its worst. And it wasn‚Äôt until school started again and I had two whole classes with him that I started becoming happy again. Things are going good overall. Obviously I‚Äôm still a mess but I‚Äôve always been a mess. It‚Äôs just been a pretty big mess this week that‚Äôs all.

I don‚Äôt want to think about mom or Fink right now. I kind of got off on a tangent again. I seem to have a problem with that. I just gotta make it to Sunday. Then I can relax for a few days. "

0,"He'll never call me beautiful and have it be the truth
I thought I'd never be happy. When I was 8 years old, my (f) cousins sexually abused me, and I thought that after that no man would ever want me. I used to cry myself to sleep at night mentally telling myself I should just be happy with whomever I got, and that I'd be lucky to be of sexual service to a man, because I'd never be anyone's first choice. I even started self harming in a most intimate way. I would carve harsh sawtooth like ridges into jumbo crayons and use those to masturbate with until my hand was covered in blood. I fantasized about how whoever my husband eventually was, he wouldn't want me. He'd tolerate me, at best.

&#x200B;

Twenty years later, nearly thirty years old now, my fantasies from childhood have come true. I spent a long time just dating whoever was interested in me- beggars cant be choosers after all, and I am very ugly and fat. I made a rule that I would never break up with a man, because if I did that over something stupid then I would just be ungrateful. Through much of my life I've followed that rule. I just made myself be happy with whoever I was with... the last relationship, lasting 8 years, devolving into a complete dead bedroom after 3 of those years. Despite me wearing lingerie and sometimes outright begging. Still, that isn't the issue that brings me here today. That has had years for me to become numb to it.

&#x200B;

As if through some miracle, someone who thought a lot like me, liked the same kind of games that I did, and had the same weird metaphysical interests as me became a very close friend. They told me everything, insisting I knew them better than anyone other than perhaps their own mother. Eventually while drunk one night, this man confessed that he loved me. He had never done anything sexual with anyone, and being a 'late bloomer' he had thought he would just have to pay someone for whatever intimacy he eventually had. He told me ""at least if it was with you it'd be someone I loved"".

&#x200B;

I felt as though... nobody had ever loved me this much. The closer we got the more I started to fall for him too. Soon we were voice chatting, and eventually we were sharing pics. I thought he was handsome and he thought I was, well... cute.

&#x200B;

Things were going well so well that we decided to meet up for real. We did, and we spent two nights together in a hotel. Those first two nights were so awkward... the farthest we got was hugging. I was alright with that, I didn't want to push things with him. When we talked after meeting up, he explained that although he loved everything about who I was as a person... he didn't like how I looked. He wanted to be with me despite that, and I resolved to try and improve myself. After all, I had really let myself go, and I knew 310lbs wasn't healthy.

&#x200B;

Some months passed and through intermittent fasting I lost 80lbs, landing me at 230lbs. I was much smaller than before, and I even got surgery to remove the excess skin that remained from how big my stomach had previously been. I was so excited, I weighed less than I did at the end of high school, less than I had my entire adult life. I felt great about myself, and I was content to stay at that weight for a while.

&#x200B;

We met up again. I paid for a lovely hotel. 9 Nights in his hometown in a suite I couldn't believe I could afford. The very first night he told me, although he was really proud of my for my efforts and I looked far, far better than the last time he saw me... He still liked girls that were thinner than that. I'd have to be thinner for him to want to initiate anything sexual. I asked him if I could suck his dick, something I figured looks wouldn't matter for, and despite having never experienced that before he still said no. Those 9 nights, sleeping together, and the most that happened were a few small peck-style kisses and some cuddling on the couch- which I still appreciated tremendously, and they are some of my most treasured memories.

&#x200B;

Time goes on. I'm having trouble continuing to lose weight. My willpower fails me.

It's been over a year since we became romantically serious about each other, and still he finds me no more attractive. To me, he is everything- seeing him is unreal, like seeing a celebrity in real life. We often have conflicts about his attraction. Sometimes he reassures me and says he's sure that eventually when we live together he'd feel comfortable enough with me to try out sexual things.

Tonight, though...

&#x200B;

He told me about a dream he'd had, a dream in which some very odd sexual stuff happened. He wasn't upset about the dream though, rather he found it entertaining. Stupidly, I internalized this and felt bad. I said I didn't understand how he could subconsciously tolerate such gross stuff in his dreams, but I was across the line of 'too gross'. I told him that I was able to leave my kinks behind and focus on just enjoying the partners I had in my physical life, and that I didn't understand why he couldn't. He said I was just repressing myself, and that he had no choice what he was attracted to, whereas for me being fat... it wasn't like I didn't have a choice. I told him all I'd ever had was negative reinforcement- being told I was too heavy, too ugly, too fat, too gross, smelled bad (despite showering regularly) and other stuff, and that it hurt to know that I was so gross to him that I'd never hear him tell me I was pretty, beautiful, or god forbid... sexy... without knowing instantly that it was a lie. I thought it was unfair as I often tell him how handsome and attractive I find him, and everything about him.

&#x200B;

There is no resolution to this story.

While I could easily find someone who is willing to butter me up with compliments, or provide me with sexual relief, I have never found someone willing to do those things who also meshes well with me mentally. Someone who wouldn't think I am crazy because I believe in things even more far fetched than a typical religious backstory. Someone I could feel comfortable telling anything to.

&#x200B;

I keep insisting to myself that it's better to be mentally satisfied with a partner than sexually, as my health is bad and even now although I am not very old I am rarely in a good enough condition to be having sex or even masturbating. Still, it all keeps coming back to how 8 year old me was right. No matter who I am with... they arent going to value me sexually. And if they do... they wont value me other ways. It just kills me because what does truly get him off, I can't ever be in real life. Even if I lose all my fat completely, I'll be saggy from having been fat before, and I'll be scarred from my multiple surgeries. And I can't ever be an anthro animal or dragon or whatever flavor of furry creature he's into. He even finds me so ugly that when I've asked if he'd like to see me wearing ears or a tail or even a fursuit he just cringes.

&#x200B;

I'll never be what he wants, and I'll never be beautiful to him. I deserve it all, because I am too fat.

I'll be going back to having 3-5 meals per week to try and lose more weight. The hunger I feel can just be additional punishment for daring to be ugly. "
0,"Scars from a rash
At the age of 22, I was still living with my parents.  My cousin came over with her sister to visit my mother.  I don't know these cousins personally but I do know this cousin is about 20 years older than myself.  On this particular day she visited, she decided to say something to me which she never has in the past.  She said, all while smiling, ""You had a bad diaper rash when you were a baby"".  I didn't know what to think or say.  Why would the first thing she has to say to me be something so negative?  And why did she have the opportunity to look down there?  And why was she smiling?  This wasn't funny.  I know how my mother would laugh at things like this so it led me to believe maybe they were making joking about it.  This was very mean and disrespectful.  So, she remembered about 21 years and 2 months ago that my mother stripped my diaper off for her to look at my privates and rash?  Why?  This made me very angry.

When I was around 10 months, my mother decided to bathe me with neutrogena soap.  She had to know this would be too strong for a baby.  She had three girls before I was born.  Well, this soap caused a bad chemical soap burn in my bikini area and it left large scars which I still have today.  Some parts of the scar looks like I was a burned victim because the skin overlaps and looks just like a burned victims skin.  I couldn't take care of myself.  She caused the rash which resulted in scars.  I was never taken to a dermatologist to find out how the scars could be removed.  She just left them there.

My mother has always loved to make you feel embarrassed because you're naked and she had to know I was even more embarrassed because of the scars she left on me.  When I was 7, I noticed her staring at me and didn't know why.  She told my father, ""give her a bath""...then my sister said, ""she doesn't want him to give her a bath""...I couldn't say I didn't want him to bathe me because I wouldn't been beaten and forced to let him anyway.  After he bathed me, he asked my mother about the scars.  I was so humiliated.  First a man bathing me at 7 and him seeing the scars.  He never bathed me before.  She just wanted me to be humiliated.

My mother has been known to strip a baby's diaper off many times before to show visitors things.  She used to have a home daycare and she kept mentioning one of the baby boy's had a small penis.  So, when my aunt came over to visit, she stripped his diaper off and they were laughing at it.  Afterwards, she made my sister put a diaper back on the baby.

Dear diary,

Why do I have such a hard time accepting my self worth? I work three jobs and I'm in grad school full time for a degree in social work. I work so hard, but I don't think I deserve anything. How am I in a field that puts so much emphasis on self care and mental health when I am struggling so much? I feel like I don't deserve any praise or any positive attention from my peers, professors, supervisors, etc. because I'm afraid it's all out of pity. All signs (grades, conversations, self assessments) point to me being successful, but I can't accept it.

You know when you see someone presenting in front of a group and they're just so nervous that their voice is shaking and they say ""um"" after every word and overall their presentation is HORRIBLE, but you can see how much effort it is for them to just stand up there in front of a crowd so you tell them how great they did? I fear that any time I receive a compliment, it's like that. Realistically, in my mind I know that it's not the case, but there's always a voice in my head telling me that I'm a piece of shit and any attention I get is out of pity.

I don't know how to change that.

Alright, the past few days have been rough. I think it was Monday morning I edged to Her and again this morning too. IDK what to do. I want Her so bad but my actions just like that I feel just make Her want me less. I also tried talking to Her yesterday via text and She only gave me super short responses and I am not sure why. I want things to work between us still and I think they can. I just need to focus on the positives I think. I stayed up late working on a presentation I have to give in a few hours because my procrastination paralysis wouldn't let me actually start working on it until like 12:40. Stupid me. It feels so simple to just start my work or relapse or whatever but it feels difficult. I feel like it shouldn't be this hard. I talked to my brother about the work thing last night and he said I could go get free counseling at university if I wanted to. I might just have to try that. I missed Her yesterday and I told Her I just wanted to watch GOT and cuddle and I also asked Her if She saw the new trailer and She just replied ""Yea"". Kind of a bummer. I know it's hard for Her to be with me, I get it. But it doesn't stop me from feeling frustrated at times, not that I feel frustrated now per say. I feel understanding, mostly, at the moment. In good news it's Wednesday which means the school week is almost over. I just have to get through my presentation and then finish an assignment before midnight and then I can finally take the smallest of breaks. I do need to get work done this weekend though because the semester is really kicking up for the last half. Alright, that's all for now. I need to eat and start practicing."

0,"The Universe: SLOW DOWN
The message. Whatever mantra or affirmation That the universe has chose for me is (in my slow motion voice) SLOWWW DOWNNN.

So the night of the shrooms. I remember speaking to my baby and staring into his eyes and feeling his soft face and silky hair. Smelling him. Feeling him. Staring at him. All of it was so detailed and brand new. He asked me such profound questions. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the boss of this family?‚Äù He gave me such good advice. He understood me. He loved me.


In that moment I realized that just as I have an internal monologue, he has one too. I put myself in his shoes, i realized in so many ways he is just like me. Nervous and detailed. Charismatic and dramatic. Sensitive and emotional. He is his own human being self. But he is so much me and my experiences. He is his siblings‚Äô tendencies and friendships. He came into this world a pliable baby chunk of dough, and he has been molded and seasoned by all of his people and experiences. He has his own life. He is so lovely. A true personified spirit angel.


I asked myself why I had never realized this. Why it took me trying psychedelics to realize what is so obviously and clearly always in front of me. I felt such gratitude for him. I felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve anything so pure. I thought on the times I was so caught up in my own human selfish feelings and moments that I forgot to sympathize with his. I felt clarity. I felt love. I felt guilt. I kissed him as he slept. Begged for quiet forgiveness for anytime he felt pain in this world, and prayed to the universe my gratitude.

The message I received that night was simple.

SLOW DOWN.


I tested it. I thought of moments of anxiety and tension and sadness that i had experienced recently. Could my so called problem in these situations be solved by implementing this command.? Slow down. Slow it down. Gooo slow. I remember my epiphany being so amazing that i pulled up my notes app and wrote - the message is to slow down. I wanted to make sure I remembered it.


Since that moment, I have not been perfect. My old habits and foggy moments still rule me on autopilot. My kids still stress me, worry me, love me. My mind has been fast and nervous and dramatic. But every so often it pops up in my head. *slow down*. So I do. And I become fully present and see the world in Clarity. And it is amazing. These precious moments of mindfulness are small and far between. But they are happening more and more. It is a habit I have intentionally cultivated. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.


Never forget this. "

I love how every day of my life is just one mood-swinging rollercoaster anymore. The sale went well today. Made 33$. That‚Äôs a total of about 50$ so far. Which I‚Äôm honestly surprised about.

I stressed about writing a grant and came up with an outline and later found out that it‚Äôs pointless to write one to the PTA for something like this. That ruined me. I came to terms with not being able to go to the camp that hour, and I cried it out and was just really depressed the rest of class.

I went to the bathroom right before the bell because I had to cry and shit like a pathetic loser, and I came back to grab my bag and on the way Milla said that Fink wanted to talk to me, and I was like, what?? So I went in sheepishly and he was like Oh Syd, I need to talk to you. I shrugged and continued to be sad. I technically should have been in the basement taking my math test but screw that. I‚Äôm already failing anyways.

He told me to walk with him because he had a meeting to go to. And HOLY COW. This man is the nicest and most caring person I have ever met (but I already knew that anyways.) He genuinely cares about ME. Stupid old me who really isn‚Äôt that great of an artist anyways but is obsessed with pleasing him. He said that there is another school fund that might be available to help. I was a little sheepish when I found out I‚Äôd have to directly talk to someone in person. I‚Äôm pretty bad at that and he knows it. I thanked him, and went down to sit by the painting room waiting for dad. Logan came around the corner and we started talking and I opened up about the whole camp situation. He was sick yesterday so had no clue. I cried and whines like a sad little artsy bitch. I hate myself sometimes. But he‚Äôs so understanding! I love him aaaa.

I was SO SCARED to talk to dad about any of this. I just didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd know how. But tonight was a miracle. Anyways, when I got home, I had already come to the decision I wouldn‚Äôt go to the camp. I was disappointed but life would continue. I wrote a long text to Fink explaining that there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm gonna be able to go, and that I really appreciate how much he‚Äôs trying to help me. He wrote me back while I was at work saying that he wants me to make smart decisions and stuff and that he wants to do everything in his power to help. I am so thankful for him. I don‚Äôt know where I would be without all that he‚Äôs done for me.

I decided then I‚Äôd try to go still. I‚Äôll do everything in my power. We went to IKEA after I got off work. Dad was in a good mood, we all were. It was a miracle. IKEA always does that to him for some odd reason. Anyways, we got home and I hung around in the basement waiting for my opportunity to talk about the camp and my situation. IT WENT SURPRISINGLY WELL! He doesn‚Äôt seem absolutely opposed to it like before! Maybe it‚Äôs because I gave him a lot more info or something, or maybe it was the IKEA frozen yogurt in his stomach. Regardless, things look brighter for sure. I need to decide ASAP. I want to pay the 300$ deposit by Friday or sooner.

My stupid reddit diary entries sound so fake. I kind of wish I‚Äôd just spit out everything that came to my mind, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs for the best long term. I just think that every day is important, no matter how great or bad. And there are thousands and thousands of days in my past I have absolutely no recollection of that I wish I could remember. "

Some thoughts;

I‚Äôm still the same old sack of shit.
After all my drama this morning, things worked out fine like they always do on Mondays. Why did I doubt myself or anyone else? The sale went better than expected, class was alright, zine club was great. Yet I‚Äôm lying on my bed like a lump of fat with 27 bleeding cuts on my left thigh.

I called the CE office and found out that even if I do smaller payments, it‚Äôs still gotta be in my June 1st. Now I‚Äôm really screwed. Working overtime is not an option, and I‚Äôm deathly scared to tell dad I didn‚Äôt get the scholarship. He won‚Äôt ever understand how much this means to me.

Fink suggested writing a grant proposal to the PTA. Apparently they don‚Äôt often get grant requests from students, so I‚Äôm hoping I have some chances. I don‚Äôt want to write something TOO pretentious, but I really need that money. The last thing I want to do is get my hopes up. Because the second I do, according to Murphy‚Äôs law, that grant goes straight to the trash.

Not going to this camp or college seems really appealing to me right now. But this is my only path to success. But who needs success anyways? My dream life is living in some trailer park where the winters aren‚Äôt 2 degrees, and where I can live in peace and draw for the rest of my days.

Anyways, today was alright, as far as days of the week go. I wish this whole camp thing wasn‚Äôt looming over me. I need to talk to dad ASAP. But I want to write a rough draft for my grant proposal before Fink leaves for his conference or whatever.

I‚Äôm so glad he asked me what was wrong.

Wish he would have done that 4 months ago."

Too much of a good thing has left me numb and melancholic. I feel absolutely worthless and dumb. I bother him so much. All the time, I‚Äôm like a never ceasing crying child that won‚Äôt shut up. I bet even my friends think I‚Äôm a kiss-ass too.

I came in early to make some buttons for the art club fail sale. The only reason I‚Äôm trying is because I committed a long time ago. And that girl on newspaper interviewed me. I don‚Äôt even know if I can get Erin to help me during lunch.

I made my buttons and I forgot to ask him if we had permission to sell stuff until last night. I made him go all the way to the office for my stupid sale idea that will never profit. He asked me if I could explain the difference between digital design and graphic design and I failed miserably. I‚Äôm a useless sack of garbage who can‚Äôt even speak coherently. He probably thinks I‚Äôm just a sad, useless loser now. I was going to ‚Äúanonymously‚Äù donate some money to the sale so it would look like I actually accomplished something but now I‚Äôm broke.

I didn‚Äôt get the scholarship. Any scholarship at all. Hell, even 100$ would have helped a ton. I cried for two solid hours straight and my eyes stung for the next two days. All that work for NOTHING. Maybe it was my portfolio, maybe it was my recommendation letter, maybe my statement of intent, or maybe they don‚Äôt want a cis-gendered white female that doesn‚Äôt draw cartoons and isn‚Äôt very political. Milla hasn‚Äôt even gotten an email yet and I bet that means she got a scholarship. If SHE got one, then I‚Äôm definitely doing something wrong.

I did the math and I cant pay $2,900 by June 1st. It‚Äôs going to take a miracle if I want to go. I‚Äôm going to call today or sometime this week and find out about payment plans and options. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint Milla or Fink. I just want to run to the bathroom and cry and bang my head on the wall until I pass out.

Everything looks bleak. I‚Äôm an utter failure who can‚Äôt do anything right. I just passed Erin in the hall and asked about him helping me with the sale during lunch and he looked confused thinking it was just on Wednesday. I hate myself. I want to smash my head and just die. I‚Äôm gonna have to convince Mrs. H to let me take all three lunches. I hate myself. If I didn‚Äôt have art, I‚Äôd kill myself.

0,"UTI, Cold, Sad, Crush
This cheap vodka is giving me a uti. It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôm almost done with the liter.

Volunteered at the school today. As I was checking in I saw the back of Mr. M. Was hoping I‚Äôd see him later in the day. I didn‚Äôt. Not even after school. I think he left early.

I spent an entire day yesterday thinking about him. Then when I woke up today, i really didn‚Äôt care. I googled ‚Äúwhy do I keep having inappropriate crushes?‚Äù and it was actually very eye opening. So it more or less has to do with a certain part of our brain not having evolved in millions of years. Our brain tries to get us to have as much sex as possible with the hottest people as possible. Reproductive reasons. It said that women will develop these mad crushes when they are most fertile. I checked my period tracking app and SURPRISE Wednesday was my ovulation/most fertile day. It kind of made me laugh. I wonder if I went back and tracked all these mad crushes I‚Äôve had or these risky one night stands, I wonder if it would tie into my fertile days. Ah, science.

Anyway he‚Äôs still super hot and gorgeous but it‚Äôs not killing me with desire to fuck him today. Maybe it‚Äôs because I masturbated so much yesterday. I get drunk and high and just get so horny thinking of him. It was ridiculous. I couldn‚Äôt even cum anymore after some point. Ugh. Get a life. Meh.

I have plans tonight that I want to cancel. It‚Äôs so cold and I‚Äôve been feeling sad today. Plus i have that weird tingle in my bladder. I need to slow down on the drinking. I don‚Äôt want to fully develop this UTI. Gross.

I feel like smoking but the kids are up. It‚Äôs Friday so the oldest will be up for a long time. I‚Äôm lonely tonight. Best friend is dealing with relationship issues so she‚Äôs a downer. I have plans but just don‚Äôt have energy. I should go. I always dread going but then I have a great time. I will have to uber. Definitely won‚Äôt be able to drive afterwards. I‚Äôll think about it.

A quick post about yesterday. Yesterday was good. I think I had some bad thoughts earlier in the day during work a bit but I don't remember it being as bad as this past Tuesday. I feel a little anxious at the moment like I need to tell Her some things but I don't think that's really real. I did just make some poor choices, twice today, not to finish though and I was thinking about Her both times. But still, I need to get it together and not let those kind of things happen. I made hamburgers for Her and I last night for dinner and we went grocery shopping together. We also laid down in bed and hung out for a bit and made out a while too (progress!) I am a bit worried about feeling compelled to tell Her minor things before anything (potentially) goes further but I feel I need to. I also played some games with friends last night which I had fun doing. We made some good progress. I am not ready for school to start this week. I really need to start doing work for stuff this weekend, lame. Alright, that's all for now. I will post more later."

I worked a double shift on Saturday which was awful and then had to open on Sunday which was painful. My body is starting to feel better now. I watched GOT with Her yesterday a lot and we just hung out and cuddled, it was nice. Hopefully we will hang out more tonight. I need to go run a few chores for now. Alright, good thoughts only. That's all for now."
0,"Field trip anxiety - unnecessary
Ok so I‚Äôm chaperoning the field trip tomorrow. And because I am who I am, I am anxious af. Breathe. Phewww. Idk why I‚Äôm anxious. So I‚Äôm going to try to work through it.

Irrational thought - I will be late because I‚Äôve never been to the location and I‚Äôm scared I will get lost.

Solution - Leave with lots of time. Plan route tonight on GPS. Have clothes and everything needed out and ready. Drop other kids off earlier to allow for plenty of time.


IT- I will not be allowed because I didn‚Äôt tell her earlier.

S - Explain the change of schedule you had and explain your concerns about your child‚Äôs health concerns and the reason you want to go. When dropping kids off, talk to her about it and make sure you‚Äôre cleared to go.


IT - I will arrive and not know where to go.

S - you have a voice for a reason! Arrive early, pay and ask, ask, ask. Look for the color shirts. Text the other mom - haha where are you?


IT - I will not know how to handle the group of kids I am assigned. I will not be fun or informative or exciting. I will get lost or roam in circles because I‚Äôve never been there.

S - Give your kid their space. Let them hang with friends. You‚Äôre there simply as a chaperone. This is their day. Kids are kids! They will have fun just being there with their friends and away from school! Piggyback off some other mom. That mom you know will be there and our kids are best friends. Stay with her group because you ‚Äúwant the kids to have fun together‚Äù but you really just need a support buddy.


Getting ready -
Bags
Lunches
Outfits
Things you will need throughout the day
Medical bag for child‚Äôs health concern.
Extra snacks and water.

Eat breakfast. Don‚Äôt drink too much coffee. Take a Xanax. Smile and most of all have fun. Take pictures and enjoy this time with your kiddo. Everything you‚Äôre ever anxious about ends up turning out fine in the end. There are millions of times you were working and wished you could chaperone the oldest‚Äôs school stuff. Now you have that chance with the littles. You got this. You‚Äôre a good mom. You‚Äôre a fun mom. You‚Äôre the best mom. You got this. I got this. I got this.

I like writing just a little bit of my thoughts down every day like this. To put my jumbled mess of a brain into words is hard, but worth it. Maybe to my future self, or just my ability to make coherent sentences. Wish I were like that aloud though.

I was walking on some pretty thin lines around Alex today. I told her too much, but not too much where she‚Äôll care. I spilled my dreams of just skipping town and exploring the country for a few months. Someday. When I can actually do that. Just maybe.

I realized how much I wants therapist. Not now, while I‚Äôm underage, but someday when I‚Äôm an adult. Where confidentiality is required by law. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll ever happen, what if someone in my church circles or my dad finds out I see a therapist. What if when I‚Äôm older my dad is helping me with some financial stuff and he asks me why I‚Äôm spending all this money on a therapist. How would I explain that?

But venting to the void might be my only option forever. I can scream it aloud here.

I WANT F TO ASK ABOUT MY SCARS/BRUISES.

I WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT MOM. ESPECIALLY WITH F. BUT ANYONE WILL DO.

I WISH I DIDN‚ÄôT HATE MYSELF SO MUCH.

I WISH I DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL ANXIETY ABOUT STARTING CONVERSATIONS.

I WISH I COULD HANG OUT WITH MIL AND AUG.

I WANT MY DAD TO BE MORE EMPATHETIC.

I WANT MY DAD TO LET ME GO TO THE ART CAMP. AND I FUCKING WANT A FULL RIDE SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE I WORK MY ASS OFF ON MY ART AND I WANT RECOGNITION FOR ONCE.

THERE. I said it. That was nice. I feel selfish just saying what I feel into words. Anyways, I gotta blow out my candles and turn off my oil diffuser because my eyes are stinging and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs from the lavender oil or just being dehydrated.

NOTE TO SELF:
Draw something to screenprint Sunday.
Hang up art fair stuff tomorrow during class/after school.
Scan Aug‚Äôs zines and drawings.
Make posters for sale Monday morning and cover the school with them.
Ask F if he still wants help making shirts Monday.
Spend Monday night burning the holes in my screen.
Aim to have projection project done and presented Wednesday.

I fantasize about flying away, hitchhiking over the great west, staying a few months in Washington to understand what Jeff Emtman talks about. I want to find the great secret, maybe not THE great secret, but a darn good one. One that will drive me creatively, give me a purpose other than the Lord Almighty. I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I knew the truth, I KNOW the truth, but is there more truth? I wanna be selfish and live my life jamming out to southern rock in a beaten up convertible under the big blue sky. I wanna become one with the pen. Purposely pour my essence and hopes and dreams and experiences into each mark.

But God damn, I love it here locally. I love to dream of being the crow, an alternate version of myself free to explore the nooks and crannies of the US. But I love my city too much. I‚Äôll never be able to pick up my pens and papers and socks and leave but I‚Äôve got it good here. I romanticize the loner life but I‚Äôm so pathetically dependent on other people and their opinions of me I‚Äôd be lost and probably end up committing suicide or something.
And I love F. Not love like romantically, but love as in the fucking traditional use of the word. I love you like family. Like someone I care about. A respect higher than all mountain peaks skyscrapers of this rock in space. I‚Äôve got where I wanted in my relationship with him, according to my diary entries from October. I did it. Yay for me? He‚Äôs perfect, and he cares about me. He CARES about ME! This annoying big kid who pesters him day and night. Who sees through my failures to someone who cares as much as him back. And because F is like this godlike father to me I want to share things with him. I‚Äôd even consider us friends, but I don‚Äôt think were quite there yet.

But he doesn‚Äôt know how much I struggle. He doesn‚Äôt know about my mom, well, maybe he does. I don‚Äôt know. He does, I think, I‚Äôm not sure he remembers. I just keep going back to that time after the field trip when I broke down and he genuinely cared about me and what was wrong and I should have just told him. I haven‚Äôt hugged anyone since that day. That was almost 4 months ago. He‚Äôll never know how much moms passing still pains me because he makes me SO happy. I simply can‚Äôt be sad around him. I‚Äôve never smiled more in his presence.

And maybe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt be free, because I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôd be without him in my life almost daily. I can barely make it through a prolonged weekend without him. God knows what will happen to me over summer. And when I graduate? I‚Äôll always find excuses to come back to class or talk to him. But it‚Äôll never be the same. But that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt leave this city. I can‚Äôt leave F, even if we never talk when I‚Äôm older, I just can‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know here, I want to know this city like my own backyard, but I don‚Äôt even know my backyard and I‚Äôve lived in this house for almost half a year, and this city my whole life. I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll keep drawing. All the places I‚Äôll never get to go, all the forests I‚Äôll never be intimate with, all the gas stations I‚Äôll never steal candy bars from. All the feelings I‚Äôll never experience. I‚Äôm landlocked, and at a crossroads spiritually and soon to be physically in a year or so. With each passing day of high school my future becomes more in reach. I can almost touch the life I‚Äôve dreamt of, the unknown.

Alright. Real short. Caught up with an old friend today. Gave me some stuff to think about. Feeling good about life. Will add more tomorrow. Ok. I didn't want to type much because She was sleeping last night and my keyboard is loud enough to wake Her up. I played Divinity with some friends last night and I liked it a lot. The gameplay in that game is super fun. People say the story is good but I am personally not super interested in it. I should pay more attention to it though. I have to work later today which is lame. I should work out today too since I have the time. Maybe I will do that after this. I also need to do a few productive things. Oh, I finally filled my taxes yesterday and should be getting a decent return which is pretty hype. Had a bit of anxiety yesterday but feel eh now.

I wanna hitchhike across the Southwest US. Get dirt in my eyelashes, the red sandy kind. I want to run up behind the big void like crows and throw pebbles at them until they migrate away. I‚Äôll follow them across the plains and into the Dakotas. I‚Äôll be free and lie beneath the big blue sky. Live in a shack on some plateau and draw the my guardian angels, the crows. I‚Äôll have so many when he sand storms come I‚Äôll stuff drawings between the windowpanes. I‚Äôll steal blocks of ink from store and grow my own berries. I‚Äôll take up analog photog and capture the beauty of the plains like the love child of Man Ray and Adams. The tortured artist liberated so freely. I become one with the sickly memories tainted with grubby charcoal fingers. Clogged noses and thorn bushes. Radios and terra-cotta. Spring water and tapioca pudding.

My hand becomes one with the crow. I smash my left into the kitchen drawer to punish my feeble longings for mankind.

So today I had the entire day free of class and work, and that was nice. The first thing I did when I woke up was write a paper for my Psych class. It went well actually, and I wrote the entire thing in like an hour, but then I went back and edited it so I probably spent like two hours total on it, give or take twenty minutes. I had also already been thinking about what I wanted to write about before writing so I just needed to put my thoughts on paper. After that I went with my mom to get food, burritos, and then I came home and watched a movie and ate with them. Then I worked on my paper some more, talked to my Daddy, played Rocket League, and now I‚Äôm doing my journal. All in all, a very good day, but also quite uneventful.

I did open another envelope today. It had a pair of non-sexual underwear in them paired with a sexual note telling me to cum in them tonight and leave them alone until the next task involving them, but I‚Äôm actually going to cum in them every time I jack off until then, just to prove my loyalty, and I‚Äôm due for a new Cum-Rag anyhow. \*Smirks\* Hehe"

I am not sure why some people like her as a Prof. What else happened today. She is helping me set up a dr. appointment which is nice of Her.

There is so much to process today. I can‚Äôt write it in my physical journal for fear of being found out. She may be dead? I can‚Äôt process it. I am a selfish human being. When she needed me, i went on with my normal life. I have kids of my own. Problems of my own. All of it. Awful. Please let her be alive. If she is alive, i promise to make more of an effort. I promise to try to help. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.

The girls. Alone. Why do people continue to have children. All the medical advancements that have been made. Birth control is pretty much fool proof.

We are all so imperfectly human. No one will achieve perfection. Everyone everywhere. Dark empty vessels. Looking for some kind of fulfillment.

I get it now. Suicide. I don‚Äôt blame you anymore. I get how it can get to the point where it is too heavy. Too much. I can see where at some point it‚Äôs just impossible to process an event and continue to live the life you‚Äôre expected to live.

I just want to drink. And smoke and take all the meds. I don‚Äôt want to feel or think about it. I want my body and brain to disassociate. To go into shock. To protect me from what I have to inevitably deal with.

I hate this world. It‚Äôs all been sadness. Heaviness and death. I was never given the skills to cope with traumatic events. They were always left up to denial and moving on. When have I ever grieved? I‚Äôm too busy to grieve.

Could it be? That she is gone forever? That lives upon lives are ruined and changed. That she could be dead for months and I didn‚Äôt even know. I hate this world. "

Today I came in a pair of new undies, which came from an envelope give to me by my Daddy, and I wore them cum soaked all day long. I much liked the idea and doing it for him. I've never done that before. Work was good, and my day went well, but I didn't have a chance to talk to my Daddy as much over the last few days, and then when we did talk I feel like we've been a bit disconnected at times and whenever that happens I become manic and a bit overwhelmed with fear that I've done something wrong and I just want it all to get better and make him feel better and figure out what I did wrong so I don't do it again. But also, some of it stems not from actions I've taken and instead from the conversations we have had over the course of today. I feel like I'm alone in an issue right now, and I feel like I've left someone else alone, and I feel bad but I also feel obligated to another and for that reason I must step back from the situation as a whole I feel. So really I'm doing to him what I am angry that someone else has done, and I hate to feel like I've been forced into a corner, but I chose to say what I said for a reason. I hope everyone finds inner peace and that everything works out for everyone, and I wish I hadn't brought it up to my Daddy just because it doesn't really involve him and the conversation was just misunderstood on both parts at times and it really should have been a conversation we had in person I feel, if we even found ourselves talking about it. But it's not worth either of our times now really because of the actions I've already taken and what I sent to the other. I'm ashamed a bit of what I said, and I would like to explain it all to the other but I don't feel like I'm allowed, and I don't like that. Maybe I like having a Dom and rules because I've felt like I've been controlled my whole life and I want to be able to have control over it really, but that's some therapy crap and I don't want control in most cases so it's a double edged sword or sorts.

I was up late last night and only got five hours asleep, and that‚Äôs assuming I fell asleep right when I set my alarm, which I know I didn‚Äôt. When I finished my classes I came home and napped. Then I got up, hung out with my mom, ate some lunch, and then opened up one of the envelopes from my Daddy. I was surprised actually because the underwear in this envelope were much more covering than the others. I also sniffed and smelled the cum soaked undies I had been wearing for the last day and a half for him. They were quite musky, and quite ripe. I liked it though. Hehe

I showered and when I got out of the shower I dried my body and wrote ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs‚Äù again on my thigh, this time with red Sharpie. I also am supposed to write about that so I will do that now. I like the idea of being owned, and I like the idea of having it written on me because then I know that if I ever do something with someone else they will know and I will not have to feel guilty for not explaining, but also I shouldn‚Äôt have to I suppose. It also makes me nervous to do stuff with other people slightly, because I know I‚Äôll have to explain that. I‚Äôm sure no one is going to be like, ‚Äúcool‚Äù and not ask questions.

I feel the same way about a lot of the stuff I feel anxious about randomly. It's just bad stuff or quick little dumb thoughts that can do nothing but hurt Her and don't really reflect how I actually feel.

I've been working through this [list](https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/ultimate-reading-books-for-human-beings) of books. I've a bad habit of not finishing them, but I've been reading bits of *On The Shortness of Life*, *Wisdom of Insecurity* and the *Tao Te Ching*.

The concept of nothing has been terrifying to me, as I cling to this ego. Even as it slips I frantically claw at it, thinking if I lose it I lose me.

I'm glad the worst of that fear is dealt with.

I talked to some 14 year old today, oh the joys of the internet. They mentioned thinking about killing themselves but, not being ready. It breaks my heart but I relate, I know how it is to be lonely, but I know I can't be her friend either. I'm 21 and dealing with the same problems, except mine are abstracted to cosmic levels of, is it better for the universe to exist or not?

Funny, how I believe myself to have grown yet.. these patterns repeat. The despair takes a different form but it's the same sadness.

""Just don't forget there's still some things that'll shine in the darkness"" she says to me.

I welcome the invitation back into reality, but even so I tell her I have too leave. I have no bad intentions but it feels weird to me, I don't want this kid thinking she's in love with me, so I cut off contact the moment I sense her getting attached.

I'm sorry.

This is evident in my popularity, at least in circles where people aren't yet so cynical they see through it into the machine they perceive me to be. I want to believe I'm more than just a machine, that my life isn't determined already and that I have freewill.

I dunno, though. Ego high makes me feel alive, but I know it's fake. Ego low makes me feel faded, I want to be complicated. Odd feelings during a strange time in my life.

I'm not popular, especially when I try to be. But whenever I quit trying it seems, everything flows into place perfectly. There's barriers in place in my mind that when I try to work around, everything backs up and feels like a lie. But when those barriers come down and I let it out without worrying about the consequences, about right or wrong, about my feelings or about who might hear it, that's when my highest quality writing comes out.

I cringe at myself.

There's beauty to be found in the disgusting mess, and vice versa. It's just difficult to untrain ourselves from only seeing one side of the coin.

I'm trying to sort this information as it's coming in, but it's not easily done in elegant order, so here it is in all it's disordered galore.

as always, peace and love friendo. "

Alright, time for another one of these. Feeling a bit of anxiety but I think I am going to be ok. We will ride it out tomorrow and see how it feels. Did tell Her some more stuff today but I just want to be able to live my life without feeling anxious. Blugh. Anyways. Today was good. I got a raise at my job which is very exciting. Her and I went to the movies together and had a good time there. We both liked what we saw. She also seemed fine with what I told Her and what I feel anxious about isn't a big deal I feel but I don't want to condition myself to feel compelled to tell Her eevvvveerrything in my life. Maybe I am overthinking things. Probably. I need to sleep because I got work early and have a whole lot to do this weekend. Here's to a better ending this time. "

First and foremost, the thing that was on my mind the most today was the fact that today is one year from my car accident. I was so afraid of today for the past few months that now I am a little bit ashamed of myself. I had so many irrational thoughts. I seriously nearly convinced myself that I was going to die today at one point. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to, or at least I really hoped, and today went over like just another day. It was raining, and it was Valentines, but otherwise nothing was out of the ordinary. That‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt feel stressed out or odd in general. At multiple points during the day today I nearly broke down to tear just thinking about the accident. Honestly I just tried to keep myself busy all day as to not have a chance to worry. I had class, and one of them got canceled, and then I went home and hung out with my mom. I talked a lot to her, and lately I have been, but I need to chillax a little. I feel like I talk to much lately. I even keep sending long text messages to people. I don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôve also felt much more aggressive lately. Like tonight at the gym I felt like I was getting pumped. I haven‚Äôt changed much lately, but the one thing that has changed for sure is that I have been eating a lot more lately. Maybe my body just has more energy now. Yay‚Ä¶ I have been feeling good about eating lately, but today I only ate this morning before school and then again before I went to the gym with Daddy. When he dropped me off, after going to the gym, I‚Äôll get to that, I was talking about it, and I had already felt bad about it, but saying it to him made me feel really sad for some reason. I think it was because I felt like I let him down, and I was also mad at myself, but I did feel like I let him down, or like I really did need him to remind me‚Ä¶ And that kind of makes me feel pathetic as well, like I can‚Äôt do it on my own‚Ä¶? But whatever, it‚Äôs fine, I can only hold myself accountable in the future and try to do better. I just felt bad also because I felt bad because he does remind me all the time, and last night he told me he would remind me more, and again today in person. I don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs burden. Also, I‚Äôll be fine; I know that. I really have been doing much better.

The gym was really great, and so was the time we spent in the car before and afterwards. I really liked watching him work out. He was very sexy.

Okay Journal, I‚Äôm way to tired to keep writing, and honestly now just feeling entirely too tired, and emotional. I will really dig into the gym later after I get some sleep."

i finally got my only off day since last week. this week been busy af at work and emotionally tormenting.  i spent valentine's day working and seeing all the cute guys buy their loved ones flowers and chocolates.  each time i rang the flowers and chocolates up i imagined they were buying them for me.  i was hoping something special would happen but nothing.  so one of my managers told me to close off the register to go on the speedy checkouts and it took me 30 minutes to get off because everyone kept lining up to get checked out even though my light was off.  luckily my last customer was this older black lady who made sure no one got in my line. kudos to her.  the rest of the night and events was a blurr thats hard for me to recall and put into words. i can say that some of my coworkers annoyed me. i was helping a customer and a coworker kept saying my name to ask a stupid question which made me wants to punch him in the face.  another one cant seem to follow directions because i told him to put the close sign on the converter  belt and he puts it on the damn candy rack. he is slow but a good worker.  i get frustrated with him alot when i ask him to do something and he asks the same damn questions 30 times.  so frustrating.

i havent been playing my 3ds or emerald copy because i chose to play emulators. emulators speed things up and thats what i like. playing the actual game takes up too much time and i dont want spend hours on something i played before.  the soon i get through the game and level up, the better. now that im back to playing gba emulators, my pokemon appetite is low and i get distracted easily now and spend time web browsing electronic devices. i see this mini laptop thats super portable to where you can put it in your pocket and play all the emulators of yesterday's game consoles. it runs about $800 and i had to ask myself do i really need it? no. i have a laptop that can do all of that. im always looking at laptops to upgrade to. better specs, a web cam and more up to date. i never do it because i dont feel like transitioning from one pc to another. i might as well pour my life into this laptop until  it dies. it does need a new battery which i can get off of amazon. it does enough for me.  i shouldnt say it because i dont want to jinx it and then it starts fucking up.

i forget alot of shit now.  i remember some stuff but cant hold a grudge on it. it only occurs when im at work which is where all my pain comes from. i want to just let things go because life is too short for it. the term life is too short and you only live once remains ingrained in my mind. before i didnt want to be bothered with my family but now i want to spend time with them and do things. damn i should've scheduled an appointment with my therapist today. ohh well.

0,"day 1: sleep deprived oddity with nowhere else to write, right? alright.
Guess I started this today. My head's been quiet, but I think that's because I'm sleep deprived more than anything. I've been up reading bits of Light on Pranayama, Finite and infinite games, Sacred economics and was recommended to read ""The limits of evolution, and other essays illustrating the metaphysical theory of personal idealism""

I lack any fucks left to give. I'm working on a piece of writing I've lovingly called ""**How humanity ascends**"" not that I claim to have any answers, but it's a question worth TRYING to answer. It's interesting stuff.

Digging into all of this originally, I had the fear that in learning too much I would literally die. I would cease to exist, for having solved the God equation and uh... yeah, like get thanos snapped or something. OCD is lame, but the docs say I have BPD.

Fuck acronyms, I'm more than 3 letters anyways. I just came here because I wanted to write, and I'm the newest poster on my two favorite subs library of babel and shrug life syndicate already. Apparently, I'm a bit of an obsessive writer.

My brain is tired. I should rest, but I've been training myself, programming my mind, trying to become better than what I've settled for. I am not the first and I will not be the last, but I have to teach myself that I have to save the world because no one else will. It doesn't matter if that's true, but I have to believe it to succeed.

I've got some wild ideas, but I like to play around with these thoughts.

Honestly it's just nice to have a place to type without caring about how elegant I am or how artful my prose is, just to ramble vent and  vomit up some thoughts to look at later with a more well rested eye.

I wanna say I've learned a lot from reading but honestly, I've just realized how much more there is too learn. I need to learn how to wake up from this cultural machine I've found myself in, like Morpheus I see I'm in a matrix but slowly, surely, I'm learning how to break free. It's difficult, I'm not going to deny, to tell what we've fallen for at times.

Do we have freewill, or do we just believe we do?

Questions like this plague me. But now I'm so tired my minds drawing a blank; tablu rasa

shoulda' been a Rasta,

pastafarian lucifarian light bringer and dark slayer; words vowels verbs and nouns without sound written and sneezed out, i like word associations without regard to taboo or cultural sensitivities, connotations are held in the eye of the reader and the writer has willingly disgarded his mind for the time being with this.

i digress. I have a lot of research to do and this is my only outlet.

Nowadays I have been trying to be confined to myself. But, it is very difficult to be happy being like that. I try to be with my friends more and more but there is nothing fun being with them.

There is a technical festival held in our college and everyone is busy with themselves. But, they are so busy that they don't even have time for a few seconds. What's with it? They don't even want me here. I have never felt so unwanted in anyone's life. Its been too much for me to be with them and pretend to be happy and all. I try to act cool with them but, all I do is do reckless things and all. I am sorry penzu there are many things to tell but I don't want to. I am sorry penzu I am an asshole.

All I know and I want you to know is that, there is no one who loves me and likes to have my company. If someone doesn't need me then I am the last person on this planet they would want to be with. I don't know what's with me but, no one likes me."

Alright, I'm back. Today was Valentine's Day and it was pretty nice.  I feel anxious though because I thought of stuff I felt like I need to tell Her but didn't want to tell Her today and will tell Her tomorrow unless She asks me tonight. Ugh. I don't miss this feeling one bit and I hate it. I need to take some deep breaths and relax a bit probably. I do feel a bit excited to get back into doing this. Things have gotten worse in ways that I kind of didn't notice but I feel like I felt a lot better and had less bad thoughts and much less anxiety. We will have to see if that continues once I start this back up again. Her and I hung out today though and it was nice. I had some worried and bad thoughts pop up throughout the day but I got through them. Almost cried. I made some baked mac and cheese for Her and I and I also got brownie mix but we didn't make it. We watch Annihilation together and some random youtube videos. It was a nice day I feel. This will go better this time."

Alright, time for a new attempt. I fuck things up yet again and I feel like I didn't even see it. In hindsight it's a bit easier to see though. It sounds so easy on paper. Just be honest and open. But the things I thought or did weren't giving me anxiety and I feel like I didn't have any actual bad internet but there's no way for Her to know if I'm telling the truth or not and now we are just right back at square 1 and it sucks and She is upset and hurt which sucks. I worry a lot about if I know what love really is and if I am capable of actual love. I feel like I don't think about Her during the day a ton, just wondering what She is doing and stuff, and I feel like I wouldn't be too sad if my loved ones died or that I would get over it quickly. I wish I could be one of those people that say ""There's not a day goes by that I don't think about her"" about my mom but it isn't true. The truth is I hardly think about her. But I loved her and I love Her, I think. I don't know what to do. It's a viscous cycle of me freaking out and feeling like I might be getting feelings for someone (which didn't happen this time though which is why I didn't say anything because I knew I didn't even know this person and I just met them on Monday and it was just /is just lust or something) but She understandably feels hurt and I don't know what to do about it. And I still feel undesired physically and emotionally by Her but why would She want to hang out or have a physical relationship if I am dressing nice in hopes that people find me attractive (or a particular person) not that I would go anywhere with it, but if the shoe were on the other foot I definitely wouldn't be happy about it. Why does being happy feel so hard. We've only been intimate once in two years and I don't masturbate because I had an issue with that in the past but it's difficult having those two conditions coexist. I feel primitive or something saying it but I do get frustrated with Her and feel unwanted sometimes and it can lead to me having sexual thoughts of other people but I have gotten a lot better about that lately I feel.

my doctor decided to increase my antidepressants dosage from 100 mg to 125. i started taking my meds again today and i dont feel too much difference.  only thing im feeling is fatigue.  everyday when im at home, all i do is nap.  nap and going to work is my life at the moment. im too lazy to go to the gym and i always forget to buy healthy stuff. im gaining weight but i dont really care. only time ill actually care is when people start calling me fat. so sad.

sunday night i worked the closing shift and the manager i closed with was decent until the last 10 minute she was bitching me out because i was taking a long time on an order that had WIC. she didnt have the right item so i had to send a bagger to get the right stuff. the bagger kept getting confused and coming back to ask me which items to get which was annoying me. finally i said fuck it and just overrided the WIC item she wasnt supposed to have. one of the night grocery clerk was making fun of me because the closing manager was chewing me out. i didnt appreciate it. after that nothing new happened. just went home in a bad mood.

i switched from iphone to android. it just so i can play my pokemon games on the gba emulators. i been playing the legit pokemon emerald cart but im not even fully invested in it. it feels like a chore now to play it since ive played through it a dozen time. i played and restarted fire red and leaf green so much its a nightmare just to play it for a 2nd.  my pokemon phase is dying down since i put down omega ruby. playing games on emulators is a better choice for me because i can fast forward through all the boring bullshit.  Having the actual game cartridge can be good for collections. i want to play pokemon emerald on my phone but then i get distracted with texting, instagram which im too lazy to look at and web browsing for electronic devices.  once i finish paying off my 2ds, maybe ill get another laptop off fingerhut.

im using my android phone as a gateway for entertainment. i dont know how long the interest will last.

its late at night here so ill try to fall asleep. if not ill window shop.

maybe ill use my twitter again. i never use it because my mind stay blank 24/7.  "

On my worst days, I want you to be my best. On your worst days, I will be yours.

I like to believe that as much as this world is filled with beautiful coincidences, some things are meant to exist.

And I believe that somewhere out there - someone is also searching for the person I am just as I am for you.

The curves and edges on our pieces would fit perfectly as if we were made for one another. It's no longer a search & struggle to fit into someone who wasn't made for me. Instead it will just be.

Am I a dreamer to dream about these things? An idealist living in a cruel world of chance, logic & coincidences?

No one is certain...

But the uncertainty makes me happy - because the moment we uncover whether the universe is a product of chance or intentional creation, these questions will all be answered and imagination will have sadly to give way to facts.

I like how no one in this world knows how things really are and I want it to be that way for as long as I live."

Tired and drained.

There is a certain threshold for the amount of pressure one can handle. Even more so when the pressure stems from within.

Stuck between the mounting pressures of the inner & outer world, one has to fight hard to survive.

Even though, I don't belong into any religion.

I like to believe that out there there is a creator, one who creates every molecule & every fiber of this universe with intention, with reason, with a goal.

Everything exists to fulfil a purpose (or more). Rather, everything exists to play a role would be a more accurate way to say it; for we are all but actors on our own little stages with a horde supporting casts, extras and props while looking like coincidences when in fact, placed at the right place & the right time for a very specific reason.

For without this belief, our world will simply crumble under the idea that we are all nothing but side products of chance...."

i'm starting this research for my final project for college. it is about architecture, what i'm studying, and it is about psychology. i've always been a psychology geek and i wanted to merge these two things i really like. psychology of us and space that surround us is really interesting matter. space we surround ourselves with really impact our daily lives. but the most important thing that impact our lives is our mind. the surrounding space is just a reflection of our inner selves and our inner selves are reflection of what surround ourselves too actually.

my brother is working abroad. i'm really happy for him, because now he's doing something for his life. he's been living aimlessly for a while and now that is a big change for him. he seems at peace with himself now. we all should be at peace with ourselves.

things with my friend s. are weird lately. last time we hang out we had an argument. at start it was about the unimportant matter but then i mentioned a thing from the past that's been in my head for a long time. i just thought it was the right moment to mention it, but i was wrong. our problem, of my friend s. and i, is that we have a bit different communication styles. she's a sensor and i'm an intuitive.

0,"I didn't know I could read in dreams
I had always thought it was impossible to read coherent texts in dreams or that they would be blurry, but it seems that the only difference is that the texts don't make a lot of sense sometimes and that if you read them again, the text is different.

I dreamt I was looking for a dungeon making game. I googled ""dungeon"", then ""dungeon game"" and then ""dungeon making game"". On one of the first results, I got as a first result something that said something along the lines of ""be a hero, expand your influence, build an army"" and other buzzwords. As I read all of that, I asked myself why building a dungeon would imply building an army or expanding any influence. The legit result had a game as first result and I clicked the website.

The website had some traditional options. I looked for a download button but didn't find it. Instead, there was a start or a play button. I clicked it and there was a form. I could easily read what was in there, but it was very nonsensical and kicked me out of that scene. I particularly remember a part where 3 to 5 form fields were field with one word each. In total, vertically, they said something like ""tie the titan"" or a text where one web dev was telling the other that he should do something, but it was pretty surreal."

february started well. i'm now aware where i'm standing and where i'm heading to. these things are of a great importance to me.

february is a new start for me, that is each year. i clean a house, paint walls, start to eat better food, start to think about coming spring. i love winter and i love snow, but with the end of january i start to get weary of all of it. i need some blue and i need some green and even yellow, even if i love the whiteness and minimalism and freshness.

life is about feasting and fasting. sometimes the table is full of different dishes and you don't know what to eat first, and sometimes you spend whole day only drinking ginger tea. and that is completely ok. i love love ginger tea.

mental and physical balance. it is what is important folks.

and sleep. i'm better when i sleep enough and sleep well. but good sleep comes with balance anyway."

the last few days been cold as hell.  we been getting arctic like weather and luckily i was off from work and stayed home. only things i did was nap, watch youtube videos about nintendo 3ds and played pokemon omega ruby which is so boring to me now.  i been so lazy about writing here and in my journal app on my phone.  now i cant put in orders the event of the last few days because i held it in too long. my nintendo 3ds been making me put off things. its making me less willing to text people and to do daily responsibilities.  its really sad. i know i can do better but i choose not to because of laziness and procrastination.

Today i go back to work. it would be nice to feel the outside world. i got paid today so im debating on buying another nintendo 3ds that is on sale at gamestop for $80. i dont need it but it would be good for my collection.  i cant keep withdrawing from my savings. i dont know which period im at but im not looking forward to a fee being charged.  my priorities is so out of order.

i checked my credit score and it went up from 524 to 580. all because i been making consistent payments on fingerhuts. i still have a long way to go for fully paying off the nintendo 2ds xl.  once i pay it off, i want to get a credit card. ill have to be very careful to not go crazy. i think i can handle a credit card.

i am going to nap. "

0,"Tired of the bullying
I was born disabled and without a whole brain. There's a huge portion of my brain that does not exist. There's a huge part that developed but got damaged in the womb. There's a part that developed and is whole. All the damage started when my mom was in her first trimester with me.

There are things I can understand on my own. There are things I can understand if others explain them to me. There are things I will never be able to understand.

I am 41 years old. If I didn't get raped, I'd still be a virgin. I can do some things on my own. Some things I can't do unless others physically help me. There are some things I can't do at all. I ask others to do them for me.

One of the things I have never been able to understand easily is knowledge about things pertaining to sex. I have gotten bullied offline for not knowing about sex and I have gotten bullied online for my lack of knowledge, even here on Reddit.

My disabilities and ability to think also become a bigger challenge when my feelings get hurt. My brain doesn't know how to deal with it. Others have acted like I need to toughen up or just get out more or whatever. I can't explain my challenges to them. They hurt me with their words. Some say it's just words or it's just online. I have literally ended up paralyzed from things people said to me online or pictures or texted things I have seen online. I have literally ended up in the hospital and unconscious, leaving my doctor with the unfortunate task of trying to bring me back to life when I almost die. All because my body, heart and brain don't know how to handle the pain.

Emotional pain turns into physical pain. Doctors have told me before not to get online until they feel it is safe for me to do so. I am addicted to socializing online. I can't do it offline. Do my bullies want to pay my medical bills?

I am tired of showing vulnerability by being a chatty friend and others being mean to me. I am tired of daring to try to understand sex topics in Ask Reddit or Ask Women or in comments I read. I am tired of having to look things up online because someone wants me to chat with them but does not believe I don't know stuff and won't answer me or answers me kind of but then bullies me if I get appreciative and hug them since I am a hugger.

People tell me to look things up online, but I can't if I don't first hear about the terms or words. And why can't the talkers explain if they're going to bring it up in the first place?

It's bad enough I get bullied for my developmental challenges and being so sensitive emotionally ad if I dare say a guy likes me but we aren't dating. It's bad enough I get bullied for various other reasons and at all.

I had to block a man a few minutes ago. He told me he was going to downvote all of my posts. I thought he was a nice guy when we chatted in comments. I already got over sixty down votes from asking a question about porn when the question was what is something that confuses us. I felt so hurt that people would down vote me for not knowing better about porn. And then I see another question on a subreddit I follow about what annoys us and I mentioned how sad it makes me when I see down vote avalanches. That is where I met this guy who I eventually blocked. Is he gonna pay my medical bills? I guarantee he won't offer one penny. But he sounded very eager to cause me more pain.

Some people born like me said they talk with others but don't become friends with others because of how bad stress is for us. This is a comedy show or a critic's event for others, but for us, it is our real life. I told a guy years ago online with others that tempers and cussing is very bad for me to deal with. I mentioned some things that happen to me. What did he do? Years later, when he got mad at me when I got mad that he refused to answer me about negativities I was hearing about him when he said he likes me and others said he was faking it because he doesn't like handicapped girls, he lost his temper and cussed at me. And I am pretty sure he's way nicer to others in his life who can handle him being that way."

Last night I had a dream that I was in a bus with people I knew in my dream, but I cannot, for the life of me, remember who. Given how I was feeling in the dream, I assume they were beloved relatives living oceans away; maybe a past lover.

We drive for what feels like hours, and talk about getting ready for something. The road, as expected, turns into a huge rollercoaster and we‚Äôre climbing up, ready to drop. I was bracing myself, stressed internally but trying to show outward bravery, think about opting out, but don‚Äôt. Just grit your teeth and go for it.

We‚Äôre dropping, and I can see the entire world. It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôm unable to keep from smiling,and realizing that, I can only smile more. I‚Äôm not in control and don‚Äôt need to be. I‚Äôm free. I guess that‚Äôs why I love and hate you so much. I can‚Äôt control you, but something in me will die if there‚Äôs any truth to my irrational fears about you.

Anyway, I know things have changed now. I see more good in people and have more hope. Learning to let go of the past disappointments, betrayals, and sadness has been the hardest and most beautiful thing I‚Äôve done for myself so far. I‚Äôm so glad my often stressful dreams have turned into me feeling happy and free in some Wonderland rollercoaster. "

depression is slowly starting to creep back. Thursday I went to Walmart to get some groceries and the place was packed. all because of the snow storm coming. I was able to get my things and checkout. I paid $110 dollars! it is the first time shelling out that large amount of cash like that. im still in shock. Friday I went to work and it was a zoo. there was lines all throughout the aisles. it is crazy how so many people were freaking out about the storm. one of my managers asked to work over and I agreed. it was a 4 hour shift and I ended up doing 6. it was supposed to be 7 but things ended up dying down. I asked if I could leave then and the girl said yes. the other manager got mad and yelled at me saying they had breaks to fill out, then they find out the other cashier is staying an hour longer. the other manager yelling at me ruined my night. 2nd time this week I got yelled at by a manager.  it been causing my depression to come back. im hoping it goes away. maybe going to therapy would help. I haven't been to therapy  in months so maybe that can help.

everything was fine the last couple of days until yesterday. work was real shit. one of my supervisors accused me of taking a 40 minute break when it was merely 16. I left at 8:25 pm and came back at 8:43. as I was heading from the breakroom he started paging me. when I came to him he was real snotty and dickish about it and even wrote it down on the breaksheet! he gave me a hard time until he finally clocked out and went home. I actually liked him until that point. im really pissed that he thought I took a long break. I told the other supervisor about and she said not to worry about it and that I wont get in trouble for it since im not one of the workers that do it on a regular basis.  im so mad at him. I almost unfriended him on facebook but that wont do any justice.  im off today thankfully so I wont have to deal with him. I guess my feelings were hurt. next time I work and he's working, he will be getting the silence treatment from me.

I‚Äôve slept better today than in a long time (idk if that‚Äôs even English) I‚Äôm still sick... and I didn‚Äôt go to work either (Sick since Wednesday) I started a new series (Titans on Netflix. It‚Äôs quite good actually) Cleaned my room. Got some Designing done and Bought Injustice 2 for the pc. I also played it for like 6ish hours wich I haven done in a while.

Recently I just feel down. I don‚Äôt really know why tho. I used to power through these times with ease. What changed?
Well, it wont make any sense if I don‚Äôt explain myself.

In the 3rd quarter of 2018 I failed school. In America it would be college I believe. (I‚Äôm from germany)

The ‚Äúcollege‚Äù in Germany is significantly harder than the one in America, I just don‚Äôt want to sound dumb lmao (Why, no one will ever read this)

I went to a shool where you have to get 2 certificates to pass. The normal school one and the apprenticeship thing. If you don‚Äôt pass the apprenticeship you don‚Äôt get the normal
Shool certificate.

Long story short: I did manage to get the school part done but the apprenticeship? I failed that.

I should also add that I‚Äôm very self conscious. I really try to put myself out there to cope with my anxiety so if you knew me, you wouldn‚Äôt notice that I‚Äôm very uncomfortable most of the time.
I also keep the smallest things to myself because I don‚Äôt want to annoy anyone.

I should also say that this is not the ‚ÄúHah redditor with no friends‚Äù type thing. I did get bullied in 7th to 8th Garde, but after that I found real friends. And yet I still feel alone. They all have girlfriends (The one from one of my best mates is my roommate lmao) so unavoidably they have to set priorities and more than often that means to not have time for me.

I don‚Äôt even feel left out that much but it just really makes me question if I want a girlfriend of my own. Just someone that is always there, that I can share my passions with. (I‚Äôm sorry if this gibberish isn‚Äôt making any sense)

So most of the time I‚Äôm on the pc or I‚Äôm working.

Wich segways right into the next issue. I hate my job. It‚Äôs not even like that‚Äôs the only thing ill do for the rest of my life, but it just annoys me to the point where I‚Äôm getting physically sick.

I have to work tho. I don‚Äôt have a degree, a master or any sort of qualification for a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. My rent has to be payed... my whole life situation has to get funded somehow.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong. I have enough money to do exactly that. I‚Äôm rarely short on cash.

It will all get better when I finally go back to shool in September, I know, but the way/path im on rn is really not the way for me. I‚Äôm stuck. I draw and I edit videos. At least I used to.
When I come home from work i just don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. New games get boring within a heartbeat and YouTube has only so many videos.

Really my question is: how does one pull through such difficult and emotionally taxing times? How can you still be creative and draw, even though you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything really.

I sell my ‚Äúartworks‚Äù on Redbubble and I really want to continue to grow but hows that going to happen if I cant draw new designs?

And most importantly: I dont want to fail, not just in shool but in life. I have the feeling I wont be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù or what I want to be.

I really don‚Äôt like writing but this actually helps rn. To anyone going through a similar time at the moment. Please PM me. We can just talk or find solutions but being there for each other is the most important thing. And isn‚Äôt that what its all about?"

I decided to hitchhike back to atlanta. I am excited to see my family once again. I am going to start a new life and hopefully get married and have kids. A bus driver on bus 22 by the name of mr brown was kind enough to drive me all the way back to my house. When I got home at first my family start saying I‚Äôm so glad you're here. But in less than 5 minutes of me finally returning home my family started yelling at me for never calling them or sending them a postcard. So I immediately decided to tie a rope around my neck and commit suicide in front of my entire family.

    I've been back for a few days now and currently my family has locked me in my room. As soon as i escape i am going to blow up the house with all my family inside it because they did not want me to commit suicide so they stopped me from doing so. But i am going to make them wish that the did not stop me from commenting suicide.

When I blew up the house none of my family was in there but that's okay, because simply killing them that way would be offering them too much mercury. Also if they were dead they would not forced watch atlanta burn to the ground for what they did to me. All major cities must be destroyed because they are responsible for all the pain and suffering in the world, but first I must gain a cult following and doing that won‚Äôt be easy but nothing in life is easy. I will have to get military weapons and a ton of hydrogen bombs. So I can wait a few years and gain power in the shadows. I think I will call my cult the league of environmentalist. We will come out of the shadows  during super bowl 53 in Atlanta‚Äôs nfl stadium and reveal our plan for the whole world to see and Detonate a bomb destroying everyone in the city. I will then safely watch billions die in Alaska. After most of the people are dead I will kill my family with a flamethrower while saying you should of just let me die. Then I will will finally kill my self  by neck rope

Hello. First post of the year.

So I saw another gynecologist for a second opinion regarding my cysts. The dermoid in my ovary and the fibroid in my uterus.

It's highly possible that I'll lose the ovary. Dermoid cysts don't go away. I was hoping to see if the ovary can be salvaged, but there's a high change that it won't due to how big it is and that dermoids are intertwined with the ovaries usually.

3 weeks has gone by since I was given the news that the ovary will be removed if I want to remove the cyst. I'm taking it a little better now, but I'm still sad about it. You know, at least it's not cancer. I still potentially want kids.

The 2nd gynecologist said that due to my fibroid cyst being in my uterus, there's also risk of potentially losing my uterus too, but it's unlikely due to the fact that it's just one cyst and not multiple. Side note that multiple cysts can make it harder to salvage an organ, but in my case it's just one. I may need a c-section during birth should I get pregnant in the future, but it depends on how much uterus was taken out and if I even still have a uterus, which would take out the chances of having children.

It took me half a year to get diagnosed since I had a shitty doctor, but the good doctor that I switched to made sure that I get the examinations I needed. Unfortunately it is too late to save the ovary, but not too late that it is not a medical emergency and I'm not in excruciating pain and I can still live my every day life.

I still haven't broken the news to my mom and we have a language barrier, so it's going to be a frustrating time to talk to her about this. I would ask my coworker who speaks the same language as my mom, but he doesn't even know I have these issues and I don't want to subject him to this.

Anyway, all that's left is for the gynecologist's staff to send the request to get authorization for surgery, to have me come back in to go over what I need to know, and then... surgery.

I'm honestly still scared about surgery as there's always a risk. I've never had surgery before. I don't know how my body will react. I'm scared things can go wrong, you know? That's what gives me the most stress apart from losing my ovary and having a harder time having kids.

Also work was understanding that I'd have to potentially call off 30 days due to health reasons. Though it was shitty of corporate to reset my sick hours because they didn't notify us and I could've used my hours instead of saving them when I did call off work for health reasons before the reset.

So yeah. I've been confidential about my issues and not too many people know about it. I don't like my business being out like that. Typing this out is still kind of hard honestly.

I'm scared, but I hope all goes well."

Friday was my coworker's 18th birthday and me and another coworker went to see a movie and then we stopped at a restaurant and grabbed something to eat. all 3 of us had a blast that day. I also met her best friend and when we went back to her place, we played monopoly for 3 hours til It was time to go back home. the 3rd coworker with us was a guy and he is okay looking. I am attracted to him at work but is a little gross. he is also weird so I don't think we could mess around. the next day I stopped by her house for her birthday party. it was a little gathering so nothing major. it was decent except for the drama going on with them. my coworker's sister has been sleeping with this guy my coworker and her mom hates. he  been controlling her and making her distance from the family and its causing major problems. everyone started crying and stormed off to their rooms for a moment. it was a bit uncomfortable to see  the drama unfolding but I cant help but feel sorry for them and hope for the best. other than that nothing special been going on in my life. im still looking for ideas to where and what to do when I take a vacation. its good for a  year and then ill lose it if its not used.

0,"entry after anxiety attack.
i wrote this an hour ago after having an anxiety attack. there is swearing

everything is so fucking confusing. my anxiety is so up and down. i can‚Äôt sleep at night because my fear of sleeping alone just keeps getting stronger and stronger. i need to sort my shit out, go to the gym, stop smoking and stop drinking in such large quantities. i need to get prepped for when school comes back in a month. i‚Äôm so nervous for my exam results. today i broke down because i just thought about how much i hate myself. whenever i look in the mirror i feel disgusted. in the past year i went from 48 kilos to 58 which is disgusting. i don‚Äôt fit into my old clothes. i hate my image. and then there‚Äôs him. he is so in my mind all the time and i just want him so bad but i can‚Äôt because i‚Äôm so insecure and i have too much self hatred to actually invest my time into someone. however i‚Äôm reckless with hooking up with guys and one night flings. i am distracting myself from the one guy i want even though i can‚Äôt have him. tomorrow night i am getting drunk and i know i will smoke. believe it or not i‚Äôm only 15. i just want to feel young but i feel like i‚Äôve grown up and matured too quickly and i don‚Äôt get to enjoy the experience of being ‚Äòyoung‚Äô. i don‚Äôt smoke or drink for the ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô i do it because it‚Äôs became a part of my routine. if i gymed as much as i smoked or drank i probably would not hate myself as much. i need to do a few things this year. i need to improve myself. i am so fucking sad and depressed. it‚Äôs my anxiety‚Äôs fault and my PTSD‚Äôs fault (this is a public journal so in case any one reads this i just want to say i am professionally diagnosed from a psychiatrist. i am not saying i have this for the ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô) but it‚Äôs also my fault for not trying to get better and not trying to treat myself right. i treat myself so badly but i deserve better. i hate myself so much but i know i deserve better. this is a fucking ramble and a fucking mess. i‚Äôm so lost.

I didn't feel like waking up today. Sometimes I try to sleep for as long as possible, so I'm not reminded of my unemployment. Lol. I feel empty and hollow inside, but have to pretend I'm perfectly fine cos I don't wanna worry my parents.

I'm praying for a miracle. Honestly, I'm expecting a rejection from that place, and I feel like that's gonna get me down..... but what can I do right. Gotta continue on with the interview process. And the application process. God, please give me the wisdom to find something good and right for me - I put my trust in you. "
0,"new year same thoughts
its 2019 woohoo.... i guess. i havent done much except go to work and play my nintendo 3ds which is starting to take over my life. my christmas was good. i didnt do anything except play my nintendo 3ds and went to my coworker's house. only things i got for christmas is a personal table for my things, candy and a scarf. its not much but its something. i went and bought a regular 2ds with super mario bros built in. i know i didnt need it since i have the 2ds xl but i really wanted it. i hacked my 2ds xl but unhacked it because i was so worried about getting banned by nintendo. i know i was fine but my fear was too strong. i would hack the 3ds regular but i want to keep that clean. ill just hack my 3ds xl that i bought 4 years ago.  i have 3 3ds and yet im still looking online to buy another one. i shouldnt be doing it. instead i should be putting money aside for a nintendo switch. it is the one i really want.

&#x200B;

my coat from fingerhut came last friday. so far its decent but could be better. as soon as i get done paying it off, maybe my credit limit will go up to where i can get the nintendo switch. i started playing pokemon go again because i heard you can transfer the pokemon you caught to pokemon lets go. soon all the waiting will pay off.

&#x200B;

i didnt set alot of goals for 2019. what i want to do this year is take more vacations and do fun things. the hard part is that i dont know what to do. i need some ideas.  dating would be a good idea but im not mature enough for it. a friend with benefits would be nice.

&#x200B;

2018 was a year of change. i came out to my family, i got help for my depression when it was really bad. i went to the gay pride parade and actually had sex whitch wasnt all that great.

my legs are getting sore. The past four days I‚Äôve been running, biking, walking, or going on the elliptical. I need to get energy out but damn my legs are paying the price. Even though I‚Äôm exercising like crazy I‚Äôm eating a lot - I have two pints of vegan ice cream in the freezer, a trader joe‚Äôs baguette and a dayia pizza. Oh, and I have so much Christmas candy and a package of Oreos. There‚Äôs so much junk food here and it‚Äôs helping me wallow but not helping my self-esteem.

honestly, besides going to the gym, I did nothing today. I played around with makeup and watched Youtube videos about cheating and Gilmore Girls. I learned a lot about the psychology of infidelity and it kinda fucked me up. I know it doesn‚Äôt have to do with me, but it‚Äôs messed up that it has to negatively affect my life so much. Like why the fuck am I dying, missing you constantly, obsessively thinking about you, and waiting for you to talk to me when you cheated on me. I don‚Äôt deserve this.

I miss you. I hope you are ready to talk for the new year. There are so many things I want to tell you."

I‚Äôm 21, I have a nearly 3 year old son I don‚Äôt see because he lives with his father and we don‚Äôt get along, I have a 5 month old daughter while lives in a hostel with me and my current boyfriend and I‚Äôm pregnant again. I can‚Äôt abort, and honestly I‚Äôm so fed up with everyone being up my ass about how I‚Äôm a shit parent.

I know I‚Äôm a good mum, my baby is very happy and social, always clean even though she has reflux, growing well.. I‚Äôm not allowed to see my family because my social worker deems them unsafe. Why? Well, my mum‚Äôs house is awful because she‚Äôs a hoarder with agoraphobia. My cousin is apparently one of the most violent people in town because on her police report it says she assaulted 4 people (I was there, she was attacked by her daughter and daughter‚Äôs boyfriend, her other daughter and I broke the fight up. She did not assault ANYONE. I can‚Äôt believe it was twisted like that!) and the social worker can‚Äôt even be bothered to go and meet the rest of my support network.

I feel like I have nobody, I‚Äôm not allowed to be left alone with the baby because I have depression. I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to be a mother. Our hostel charges more than a 3 bedroom flat so we‚Äôre in debt (it‚Äôs run by a charity btw) our universal credit is a bunch of crap too, it‚Äôs not enough to pay rent and food so we only pay small rent and rely on food banks.

I get treated like I‚Äôm incapable of anything, spoken to like I‚Äôm a child or straight up retarded. My boyfriend can‚Äôt work or the places charges us even MORE and even if we could pay it - he‚Äôs not allowed to leave me with the baby. So who can I get to supervise me while I‚Äôm with the baby? I got no family or friends that are allowed to help!

What am I supposed to do? I have nothing! I‚Äôm not allowed to be a parent, I‚Äôm not even treated like a human being! I‚Äôm around my boyfriend 24/7 because he HAS to watch me. We‚Äôre starting to not get along. We need alone time. My social worker must be trying to kill me or something because this isn‚Äôt right! You don‚Äôt do this to people!

I‚Äôve complained about her and I‚Äôm getting a new one soon but wow this has damaged me. I feel like life really isn‚Äôt worth it now. My babies won‚Äôt get to see the real me because I‚Äôm never happy anymore. Not really. I can fake it but I don‚Äôt want to lie to them.

0,"Old diary entries of a recovering addict
Just a bit of backround information, I'm a 27 year old who became a IV morphine addict at 16. I'm currently in recovery and sober for a year and couple weeks, I don't like to keep exact track. I just know the last time was the day I buried my dad. I also kinda dislike the term recovering addict because I just feel I will always be a addict, just hopefully a sober one. Anyways on to a diary entry.

Diary entry #1, undated, wrote when I was 17.
:""Most days I just want to die. Sometimes it seems that it would be better to be dead than to feel so much pain, stress and suffering. It srruto never stop hurting except when I have just pulled the needle out of my arm. In the back of my mind I sometimes wish that it would just kill me. Death feels so inevitable but sometimes so desired. I dream of days that I have the luck to have enough that I can just die in peace. I wish I knew the kiss of the one I've dreamed of for so long it seems. Would it save me or am I past David g. Should I feel guilty for feeling this way? O hear people say it's not worth it to use drugs, but it's the only thing keeping me breathing.""

Man, I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. Today was good. I worked out a bit and counted my calories for the day. I went over, but still on track to lose weight and that's what really matters. Her and I watched a few episodes of Dr. Who together which were largely alright. I for some reason can't remember any of them except for the last one right now which is unusual for me I feel. Oh, another one just came back. Now I just need the middle episode and I'll be set. I also bought a few steam games and played two of them. They both seem just alright so far. I think I just need to play them more. And if not, at least they were cheap. I also cancelled my gym membership finally so I won't be paying that anymore.

I‚Äôm writing this technically on the wrong day because I fell asleep watching Stranger Things last night. I‚Äôm not getting into this season as much as the first season (hence why i feel asleep).

Today was harder. I feel like I‚Äôm getting out of the ‚Äúsad‚Äù phase and entering the ‚Äúmiss you phase,‚Äù according to panic! at the disco. I went to the grocery store and this couple was buying tortillas for a taco party or something and they were bickering about how many they needed and I almost started crying because I missed doing stuff like shopping together so much. Even when we stopped living together, and we went long distance that stuff made me very sad. Now it‚Äôs just even worse because I‚Äôll never get to lose you in a giant store but also know exactly where you are because you always sneak off to buy the same stupid things.

I also came across some old pictures of a day before I left to move out of state. we went to the beach, and we saw a dude eating sushi in the sand. we just laid on the beach forever.

It sucks missing you, but at the same time I am still remembering why our relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect. We hadn‚Äôt been getting along, we didn‚Äôt really tell each other how we were feeling, I was using masks to repress everything I‚Äôve ever felt, and we lived 2000 miles away. There were a lot of problems, and I won‚Äôt forget those either. I mean, you slept with someone else and I definitely won‚Äôt forget that.

I still know that there are better things out there. Whether or not I want to ever pursue them, i don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been asked out twice and although I‚Äôm curious, I just can‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to anyone else. I‚Äôm just not interested, honestly. I‚Äôm interested in making friends, that‚Äôs about it. Just being in a male-dominated field as a woman sucks because all your friends are men and you can‚Äôt just sit around and watch rom coms and do your nails and gossip and they don‚Äôt make fun of you when you order martinis or some cocktail instead of beer. And there‚Äôs always one to ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with you, or more like ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù as i like to say and I‚Äôm the only woman around so. "

Alright! Time for a post about Christmas eve and Christmas. Maybe the day before then too? I am not sure. Well, a few days ago I know I just spent the whole day playing games, so that isn't too exciting. Lets see, what happened on Chritmas Eve. I think Her and I actually ended up eating Taco Bell for dinner of all things. We did exchange one Christmas present early. I gave Her a new board game which She was excited about and She got me a new funko pop for an Overwatch character I play a lot. She played a game with Her brother all that day I think and I played a few different games and watch some tv. It was a really lazy day for us. It was a good day though. I got to play smash bros with my best friend (he fucking boomed me). Christmas was fun. We exchanged the rest of our gifts and She got me a really cool merch shirt for a show I like and also a new board game that's like an escape room apparently which sounds awesome. Oh, and She also got me another new board game that we played yesterday and was a lot of fun. I got Her an expansion to a game I know She likes and also a box set of books that She likes but they are the cooler looking European versions that She has been talking about for a while. Christmas at my families was alright.  My brother was an ass, but what else is new. We actually had fun because we got to play board games and stuff. I think most everyone favorite was the last game that we played that was like a dungeon crawler rpg. I was surprised that both She and my cousin liked it. Alright, that's all for now."

i missed you today, but I‚Äôm still just thinking this isn‚Äôt going to work. The good in you has faded, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to return. Talking to others about what a jerk you are is helping. Thinking of my co-worker who has a crush on me gives me hope that something better is coming. Reminiscing with my ex before you has helped me realize that there‚Äôs a better life and love out there. You‚Äôre just not the same person that I fell in love with.

It‚Äôs Christmas, and it was lonely. I spent all day watching movies and shopping online without buying anything but pajama pants to replace the ones I left at your place - starting new. I got thai curry with my roommate which was amazing. I felt happy for her and her boyfriend finally. I just want to let this go, but I need to be in the right state of mind.

I didn‚Äôt cry today, which means there‚Äôs hope. But I did think of you all day, and even when I woke up. I just need time. I don‚Äôt want to talk to you. I want you to leave me alone, but I want to tell you that I‚Äôm not waiting for you. I deserve better.

I‚Äôve spent the last month learning about myself, and changing myself and reading books to better myself and my relationships. I deserve better than someone who cheats on their girlfriend of almost five years. I always have, and now I know it.

I have long wanted to start writing my thoughts on paper.For a long time I thought about why I should have started. This is my first post supposed to be just a page of my diary.

I start today because It is one of the most important day of my life. This is the most important period of my life. I hope that writing these pages the aswers to my questions will flow between the lines.

Since I came back to home a couple of days ago It seems like everything has changed. Maybe it's just me that has changed. Here I have found my girlfriend and I'm happy. She is happy. But come back to home is never easy, I guess. For me It was easier than for her. She is been here longer than me but she still cannot go on. She wants to come back there because she fell in love with that city. But for now she have to stay here.

I have a month with her. In Febbrary my plan is to fly back. I have work to do. It's hard for me to leave. Leave everything and go. My family need me and my girlfriend needs me. But What am I supposed to do? She doesn't understand that I must go and she keeps finding something to postpone my departure as late as possible.

Now I feel like this is no more my place in the world. I know that other people have felt what I feel. This conforts me. I think that If at least my girlfriend and I could be togheter, this would be easier. Just sleep togheter and have a hug in the night. I feel alone. I feel like the world is too big for me. I don't recognize this place.

Now I know that the choices I'm doing in this moment could change completely the line of my life. I know that these choices will define who I will be in a few years."

The days keep adding up, Jesus.

Woke up early, wore my turtle neck to church. We played kingdoms for our Sunday school game, Betty lied out of stupidity and we lost because of that but it almost ended up working in the end.

We scooted the chairs in real close, only 15 of us this morning, it was kind of nice. We finished our study of Hebrews, and I even said a word or two for once.

Anneliese sat next to me in service, I always feel weird singing next to her but we‚Äôre chill. I said we should go to lunch sometime over the break and she asked if I wanted to go today. We went to the new chipotle that opened up. We talked about life, and work, and college. Then when we were almost done eating her family got there and sat down with us. Her mom is hilarious and I totally love her, but her dad still scared me a bit just because he‚Äôs an elder and so quiet. She dropped me back off home and I showed her my room.

L made a ton of cookies and we decorated cookies all afternoon, but Z and I messed around and sister-fought for a bit. I took a lot of pics to put on the personal insta. I deleted all my photos and backed them up to google last night.

I colored all the icing and helped put it in the bags, then we got to work on decorating. I made about a dozen pretty ones and then gave up and started making crappy ones. They actually tasted good unlike grandmas.

Posted my pics to insta and very soon after, F liked them. It made me so happy, I wondered if he got the ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî posted for the first time in a while‚Äù

Dear Diary,

&#x200B;

First time writing one publicaly anonymously. Perhaps, this will be something I stick to more often.

I had spent the earlier parts of 2018 in much confusion, loss & wander. It has led me to the point of realization & discovery of what is truly important to me in life. Nothing else is more important to me than to make a decent living for myself so that I can support my own dreams in life. Nothing else. I used to revel myself in the perceived attention of others - thinking that that is what I truly valued when it comes easily & cheapily without much meaning. There is no power in providing something when others can't see the value. People won't see it until something happens to you. That's just how people are. Only when you die or become suddenly important that they will say ""I have been with you all along"" when truly only I myself have been with myself all along.

&#x200B;

I want to focus on work this year. 2018 has provided me with a platform for trenmendous change & transformation but 2019, I would like to make things happen & it starts right now.

0,"I want to be a cat
Cats like to drink from the toilet bowl, from a fish tank, and potteries that hold living plants, but never from their designated cups. We misunderstand cats by saying they‚Äôre refusing to adapt to the habit of their human slaves.

In this, we might be totally wrong.

Wait for the fish to die out, remove the plants from the potteries, fill his cup with running water and make sure that he sees it, he would stop his naughty mischiefs and do as we wish.

So the cat is in fact a very romantic kind of creature ‚Äî naturally drawn to living or moving bodies. We humans are rigid and bleak in imagination ‚Äî we are good at following rules but bad at designing meaningful ones.

I often dreamed of you turning into a cat to live with me. But of course, eventually you have to abandon me after a few unhappy arguments. I did not understand you and your way of reasoning appeared absurd. I was angry at your messed-up logic and you were outrageous with my not even trying from your angle. The parting was for our mutual benefit. We both were satisfied.

When you were a cat, you liked to scratch my good sofa. I had to exaggerate my anger at you to establish the right behavioral structure, so that you know it was bad and not allowed around this household. But it never stopped you.

Cos you are a cat, you enjoyed the excitement of being caught and running away from the punishment.

Today, I‚Äôd give everything to have you back, even when it means you are destroying all my furniture.

But to this, you answered no, for a reason that I can never understand.

After all, I am not a cat."

today i was going okay, but now it has taken a turn for the worst.

I woke up at noon (again), because I can‚Äôt fall asleep until late because of the anxiety. I spent all day doing basically nothing, just reading and walking the dog. I was happy with things and us.

the more i think about this the more i‚Äôm just angry. you‚Äôre such a fucking asshole. honestly how dare you keep talking to this woman and me at the same time. i know you might think you‚Äôre ‚Äújust friends‚Äù but what the fuck dude. i can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself. i need to let go. i just want to rip this bandaid off because fuck you for continuing to treat me like shit."

Its almost Christmas and I have plans with the people I love, but the stress from unemployment is killing me. I'm dreading the questions that'll come later too.... The interview I had yesterday was one of the worst, honestly. I don't know how much longer I can do this cycle of interviews and rejections. I pray and pray but nothing still...."

I think I just have two of these to do? Not sure. Today I had some anxiety but I feel like I have mostly gotten over it, still a bit though. I am tired. Her and I saw Aquaman today which started off really bad but actually got better about half way in. I also worked this morning which wasn't bad, other people were saying how busy it was but it seemed slow if anything to me. I don't really know what I have done since I got home. Haven't play anything or watched anything really, waste of time. I need to go to bed. Lets see, what did I do yesterday. Oh, I had training, right? I believe so. I also got paid for my driving as well which feels great! No clue what I did yesterday after that though! Alright, that's all for now."

I wore my pajamas to school today. I was exhausted and I had given up. I wanted to look tired, and this is how I did it.

When I got to school the cafeteria tables were folded up and shit, there was spot on my usual spot to sit. I‚Äôm not sure F noticed me walk over there then turn around and wander for a second or two and then leave.

I went back into the hall and into F‚Äôs room before my final. M and H were inside. H was teaching M how to play poker. I worked on my final and looked dead as fuck. D kept talking and talking so I put in my headphones and blasted some Soledad Brothers‚Äî loud enough someone near me could hear if the room was quiet. Maybe F heard? I don‚Äôt know. He never really talked to me directly the whole time.

When I finished my final, H taught me how to play poker too. I was starting to get the hang of it then D joined in as well.
I‚Äôm gonna miss art portfolio over break so much. But I‚Äôm super super excited about next semester and having two classes with F!

Meteorology final went alright too. It was way easier than I expected and it might even raise my grade!

Went to rbchina for lunch for the first time. We ate it at home. Dad threw up from the chicken but it wasn‚Äôt the restaurants fault. He‚Äôs been throwing up every time he eats chicken or milk for the last few months. My food was really good and I‚Äôm sure we will go back.

I worked on my written diary a bit. Then I cleaned off my desk and printed a bunch of my blocks in gold ink on black paper, and some small black ones on white. I clipped them to string and made it look cool and posted a pic to my insta.

After that I went to work. Someone brought Joann a bunch of Hershey Kisses.

I finished cleaning my room when I got home and cleaned for a long time. I got kind of bored and decided to cut my legs. Which was sick of me to do, but I just felt like I was feeling too okay and I didn‚Äôt want to stop. I got a pencil sharpener from the basement and the blade was super sharp, the sharpest yet. I cut pretty deep, I could see the top of the dermis. It bled a lot and I washed it off in the bathroom.

I cleaned some more after that and made a schedule/calendar thingy for winter break.

Now it‚Äôs 10:24 and I‚Äôm exhausted as hell. I need to sleep bad.

Woke up early planning on studying for my English final, and didn‚Äôt. Barely got ready in time like usual. Wore my new red button up shirt and blue jeans and sandals with the gold star earrings. Felt pretty good looking again this morning.

I downloaded ep. 108 of HBM and listened to it on the bus to when I arrived at school. Snuck into F‚Äôs room and took pictures of my screen prints that were drying from yesterday. Put my coat and portfolio in my locker and went to the cafeteria.

My usual table was folded up so I sat at the circle table instead still in F‚Äôs line of sight. I pulled out ECGTB and started reading it but secret enough as for him not to realize I was reading it, but at the same time enough he could see that I was secretly wanting him to see I was secretly reading it. He didn‚Äôt see me I don‚Äôt think.

My English final was mediocre. I felt like I did good on the essay portion though. Ms. S kept looking at me weird when she saw I was reading... god forbid.. a book!

Got caught up on some South Park during 5th hr. And worked on my portfolio slideshow.

Went to lunch thinking it was time for lunch but I realized I still had to wait another hour and I walked into to AP after the bell. F looked stressed as hell which makes me stressed as hell and everyone else stressed and off kilter as well. After a minute F declared that he wasn‚Äôt going to do critiques today because half of everyone was gone and everyone just didn‚Äôt make their presentation, and the projector wasn‚Äôt working. I felt bad for him though, he gives people a lot of time to do things and they still can‚Äôt seem to do it on time.

After a while I just got tired and decided to take a nap kinda. I propped my bag up on my table and used my arms as pillows. It was a combination of stress, I wasn‚Äôt really tired, just depressed and stressed. I kept tearing up thinking about mom and shit and winter break and not being to see F or anyone else and I just was having a hard time. I left to the bathroom twice and I definitely think F noticed something was up. Maybe this was my chance?

I think once early on in class he walked by and said something quick like ‚Äúyou okay‚Äù or ‚Äútired huh?‚Äù I replied something about just being tired.

Mission success on him seeing my pain but mission failure in owning up to it and telling the truth.

Went to 7th hour and only half of our small class was there. Alex came in and we vented about being pissed over the portfolio rescheduling and crap. The class was kind of fun being so small. I drew a creepy creature on a notecard and put it on the board, even drew a ‚ÄúMr. Beanwell.‚Äù

I snuck into F‚Äôs room. No one was there so I figured he was in the dark room, I was right. I re-taped my screen a bit tighter on my own. I worked pretty quickly, skillfully, and quietly. After he came out of the dark room, and I explained what I was doing, he asked if I was doing alright, and I said yeah. Just fucking yeah. F mentioned something about the books he had recommended and admitted he didn‚Äôt remember much about ECGTB but he just likes the way the book made him feel. I agreed. He said I was a quick reader when I mentioned reading about half of it already.

I worked for quite a bit in silence but I was really working. I just reprinted my screen in green. After a while Mrs. H came in to talk about something or another class related. I wasn‚Äôt paying super close attention I was too busy cleaning out my screens and crap. When I was cleaning up we talked briefly about something or another, probably screen printing related. He asked if I wanted some blank spiral that had been in the class for ages, I said why not.

I said bye and I went out to sit in my spot on the stairs and it was hella windy and cold out, I almost blew away. I sat holding myself trying to stay warm. F drove by and smiled bye.

I got home and started cleaning my room a bit. I didn‚Äôt quite finish. I started cleaning and organizing my desk and shelf again and when I was around halfway done we left to get Freddy‚Äôs for dinner.

When I came back I organized a bit more and then got the wild idea to write all my diary entries since I started on the 3rd in the spiral, and keep my diary in a spiral because I share way too much personal shit on the internet. Also, keeping journals secret and hidden are way more fun, plus they look beautiful and are a real accomplishment when fully completed.

I started writing entries, I got maybe 3 1/2 done before it got too late and I took a shower and wrote this and am going to bed.

I hope tomorrow goes okay. I know that no matter what the hell F does or says whether great or okay, doesn‚Äôt matter because I have a lot of fun personal time to look forward to over the break. Reading all those entries were hard and weird and I don‚Äôt want to think about it that much now. Night stupid diary and the whole fucking internet."

today, was actually a really good day.

we drove from my dads to my moms in the morning. I forgot about my therapy session and ended up quitting, but I‚Äôll be going to in-person sessions because I haven‚Äôt really liked the online thing. I went grocery shopping with my mom and she cooked a glorious vegan meal for Christmas dinner. we even exchanged some gifts and she gave me socks and my brother bought me a huge box of vegan snacks which i will devour on the plane back to school.

we talked a lot, like normal. you said you couldn‚Äôt be with me right now because you are not yourself and very depressed. I understand, but like i said, i‚Äôm with you through the good and the bad. this is a super bad time for us and for you personally, but i never stopped loving you. I am hurt by what happened, but you‚Äôre the one i want for the rest of my days. whether or not we get married. whether or not we have kids. i just want to spend my free time next to you. we need to work harder on our relationship, and i know we will. this has opened so many lines of communication and i am grateful for that. we‚Äôve already started talking about potentially moving in together when i graduate again. i can‚Äôt wait. I miss you so much it physically hurts. but you need space and i understand that.

two weeks, it doesn‚Äôt feel real.

today i am questioning everything.

i‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs best for us to part ways so we can grow apart. I think that might be good for you, but i feel like i have been allowing myself to grow outside of the relationship for a long time. i mean, i‚Äôve had jobs and am in grad school and on track for my dream career. i am happy in my personal life. but you aren‚Äôt. you don‚Äôt know what you want to do, what job you‚Äôre going to have. maybe you need time. i‚Äôm just afraid that you‚Äôll move on without me. i can‚Äôt fathom the thought of you with anyone else. i almost feel like it‚Äôs a little manipulative and wrong. if i love him, i should let him go. and if it is meant to be we will end of together. i should trust that.

i want to be friends, though. i mean I‚Äôm an INTJ and although i go out occasionally and talk to other people, you were my best friend. i don‚Äôt want to lose that. but i can‚Äôt sit idly by if you‚Äôre going to start moving on.

i also am hurt though because you won‚Äôt tell your friends about us sleeping together. are you ashamed? you know this isn‚Äôt going to happen and were just using me? i don‚Äôt know, but honestly it kinda sucks.

evening thoughts.

I can‚Äôt sleep. I told your mom about your depression and it feels weird. I feel bad, but I didn‚Äôt feel right before either. you may be very mad at me. but that‚Äôs okay. I really think that I needed to do this. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll talk to me again. I feel crazy - like i can‚Äôt stop thinking about you and keep trying to do things that maybe aren‚Äôt helpful. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I miss you "

A very long day but in retrospect was very bland.

Woke up early to cut my bangs. Never cut ‚Äòem this short before. I‚Äôm not sure I like it or not. I enjoy the freedom but I feel a bit self conscious about them being so short.

Wore my green Rocky Mountain T-shirt and the better fitting black jeans with my sandals. Felt pretty good looking today with my new haircut.

I posted on my story asking for book recommendations for some winter break reading.

Did the usual morning routine, except this time, Justin, the weird muscly sophomore with a limited sensibility of social cues came over and sat down in front of me. I accidentally made eye contact with him and I guess he took that as an invite to sit with me. So much for being sad and depressed about my dead mom in front of F.

I made as polite conversation as I could. He came to art club meetings occasionally so I was particularly nice. He has no talent but he has a drive unparalleled to me.

I left to go to take my algebra final. F posted something in the art portfolio chat about our critiques for tomorrow.

The algebra final sucked big time. I ended up getting a 53% on it. I barely kept my C with a 69.80% in the class. Glad that craps over with.

Went to our last creative writing class of the year. I‚Äôm really sad, although I had a bitter-sweet relationship with that class. We had snacks and we had a good ole time writing. I wrote compliments to Molly and Emery they weren‚Äôt very good but I tried. At the end I started getting really sad. I love being in Mrs. A‚Äôs room. Guess I‚Äôll actually have to start going to FRLNCR meetings now. I got three amazing compliment notes, one from ray, one from Mrs. A, and I forget the other one. Rays was really beautiful and funny and I didn‚Äôt know she thought that way about me. I guess people are all good in the heart, just sometimes appearances and behaviors paint a more wild and rude picture.
Mrs. A suggested cadet teaching (kind of) to me and Lucia. We both got super excited about the idea of being cadet teachers next year. I‚Äôm really going to miss that class and I‚Äôm thankful for how much more in touch I‚Äôve become with my writing.

(Somewhere around 11:30, F replied to my story inquiring about books and suggested, ‚ÄúEven cowgirls get the blues, and jitterbug perfume.‚Äù)

Skipped lunch. Wasn‚Äôt very hungry after snacks and I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to deal with the hell that is 1st lunch. Snuck into Mrs. H‚Äôs room and stole her iPad Pro to work on my social commentary art project. She had a sub that hour and was very confused when I got up and left when 1st lunch was over.

I worked on my drawing on the iPad all of 4th hour review. It looks pretty damn good and I‚Äôm happy with it.

Ditto 5th hour review, I just worked on my drawing and printed out a few test versions.

After school was over I went down to F‚Äôs room to ask for help making a screen-print. I stumbled over my words when asking him if he‚Äôd help me make a screen. Liza and that kid Justin was there for a majority of the time after school. He helped me right away and I felt nervous showing him my drawing. He didn‚Äôt say anything, but he usually does that. Doesn‚Äôt questions things, just silently judges.

It was nice just being in the room with him. Talking to him, even if we weren‚Äôt alone. I was kind of glad we weren‚Äôt alone too. We talked a bit about college and what Ellie thought of it with Liza. F started going on about the college experience and how great living in a dorm/apartment on campus is and how nice it is to be so close to your studio space. I completely, 100% agreed, but I just had to say, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a lot cheaper to live at home.‚Äù I feel so guilty having all these financial restrictions. I don‚Äôt think he had those growing up, I bet his parents are pretty loaded‚Äî or he married rich.

I feel awkward if I‚Äôm not super charismatic me, or super sad and depressed me around him. I hate the in between.

The first time we printed the screen, it didn‚Äôt work and we couldn‚Äôt figure out why. I got him to cut me a new piece of screen so we could try again, and it worked. He was feeding it in the wrong way. He said we‚Äôre getting professional screen printing equipment for next semester. I‚Äôm excited, the art rooms going to look like a sweatshop pretty soon.

I had some problems printing my screen. But I got to work with him one on one doing it. He helped tape up one side while I taped the other, he held down the screen when I would pull the ink through. We were a good team.

I feel this weird tension though. I feel like he wants to kind of be my friend? If that‚Äôs even the right word. More like favorite student (if that‚Äôs not too self centered of me to say?) I don‚Äôt know... But I feel like there‚Äôs this awkwardness too. It‚Äôs hard to explain, I‚Äôm definitely just overthinking things.

I left and thanked him for all the help, I really meant it. I took down my things from the display case so I could photograph them tonight. On his way out he said bye. He said he was going to look at Christmas lights tonight.

I went and sat in the freezing cold in my normal spot and he waved bye. He‚Äôs just the best person ever. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through break without him and my friends when I can‚Äôt even make it through the weekend without breaking down and crying/cutting myself like the little emo child I am.

I went to the 5$ store with dad to get Z some Christmas presents right after school. I got her some nail polish, some makeup wipes, and some pocky sticks.

I got home, heated up some brisket, wrapped her presents, looked at the presents already under the tree. I have 2 and Z has like 5. When L got home I convinced her to take me to the library after dinner.

We did. I was able to get ‚ÄúEven cowgirls get the blues‚Äù and in a panic because none of the other suggested books were available, ‚Äúon the road.‚Äù

I got home, made some hot chocolate and set it in my room so I could take a piss real quick and I noticed F was online on insta. I wiped and got back to my room faster than a rabbit and posted to my story a thank you for everyone who suggested the books. By the time I‚Äôd posted it, F went offline and I deleted the post before anyone saw and re-wrote it all pretty and aesthetically tagging F and Milla and Alex and Claire.

F replied,
‚ÄúEven Cowgirls Get the Blues blew my mind when I first read it. I was probably 19. It‚Äôs about a bunch of women but it still made me feel empowered and  inspired. Tom Robbins is awesome. Skinny Legs And All is his other one I love. Happy reading.‚Äù

And I said ‚ÄúThank You!!‚Äù

He said, ‚ÄúMy pleasure.‚Äù

So around two hours ago I started reading. I really like the book so far and I can‚Äôt wait to see where it takes me. I have a half mind to finish half the book tonight, or even the whole. But even I don‚Äôt have that patience anymore.

I really miss reading. It had such a positive impact on my life as a kid. I remember the excitement books brought me. I miss being able to read an 800 page Harry Potter book in one day.

I haven‚Äôt read anything on my own in a long time. I don‚Äôt know if this counts as ‚Äúon my own‚Äù considering I‚Äôm really only doing it to please F, but I‚Äôm glad I am. It‚Äôs a good book.

Took me almost an hour to write this because I was so detailed and got distracted a few dozen different times. I‚Äôm going to read more of the book now, or maybe hop in the shower to wash off the grossness. Anyways, goodnight dumbass reddit diary."

Alright, time for a quick few posts. I know I didn't post today yet or yesterday so lets start there. Yesterday was alright, I met up with people pretty early in the day and got some studying done before our exam. I think meeting up with people wasn't the most helpful thing but I did get some stuff  I def needed for the exam from it. I also think that exam went really well. Had some troubles with bad thoughts both yesterday and today, but I got over them which is good. I studied a lot for my exam that I had today too because I was worried the most about it out of all my exams and I feel like it ended up being easier than I thought it would be (but idk). Work was fine. I might end up having a really nice schedule next semester for work, I will just have to wait and see how it pans out I suppose. Her and I went to the mall so She could study when I got back and I got Chipotle for dinner which I shouldn't have. I also played a bit of smash bros with Her before bed which was cool (even though I am sooooo bad uggh). Alright, that's all for now. Day off tomorrow, woohoo!"

Woke up with my hue lamp. It always helps me wake up more peacefully. I really am glad I have it. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been feeling better today. I may do a test sometime in the future.

I wore my big maroon shirt, the long black jeans, my pizza socks and sandals and my denim jacket. I know the jacket makes me look huge but I feel protected in it.

When getting ready I got a reply to my Instagram story about my mom from F.
Just a ‚Äú‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù

He fucking knows now. I did it, is this what I‚Äôve wanted? Why don‚Äôt I feel ecstatic or sad? I don‚Äôt know if he read it carefully or just skimmed and put replied with a heart. But either way, he saw. He even replied. I feel less alone now. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs connected the dots with my zines and my personal narrative project and shit but he knows now. And I‚Äôm glad.

I sat in the cafeteria like normal and did a pretty damn good job of looking depressed. Athena came over for two minutes to chat and then she left. I don‚Äôt think F saw me but I hope he did. I couldn‚Äôt face him after what I posted and shit.

I went to 1st hour and worked on a to do list and the boys basketball poster. It started to really take shape 2nd hour. Today was a weird schedule because we had our first Final today. We had a 1st, 2nd and 3rd hour review then lunch then our 1st hour final. I finished the basketball poster during lunch with Alex D and L and G. I hope they like it.

I studied for my 20‚Äôs test in 3rd hour. I was sure to memorize everything almost word for word.
The final was super easy. I was the third person finished and I‚Äôm sure I got a 100%. We watched an episode of the office for the rest of class. The one where Pam walks on the coals.

M told me to meet her in the counseling hallway because she had to bring me something so I‚Äôm like fuck yeah and took the pass and snuck up to the next floor hallway waiting for her. The halls were ghostly because everyone was taking their finals. She didn‚Äôt appear so I went to the bathroom to avoid being asked what I was doing. She said to meet her there after the bell.
So I did.

I came back and she came from the 5th floor with H and was holding a wrapped present! I was so shook that she‚Äôd do something so thoughtful when we barely saw each other. I held onto it for a while and we talked about Christmas presents for a minute. Finally I was like, should I open it? And I did. It was kind of awkward but it was fun. She got me this big book about this Dutch painter. She said the paintings reminded her of some of my art which I can‚Äôt see even remotely how but I thanked her and gave her a hug.

My only problem is the painting on the jacket of the book is of half naked women and there‚Äôs a lot of butts. At least its artistic?? I just can‚Äôt you know, read it in my living room without my sister pointing out the fact that the book has some backs of naked women on it. Still, I absolutely love it and plan on reading it over break.

I ran down to the bus and went home. I thanked M on my public story and shit. She‚Äôs so fucking nice what the hell I still feel like an idiot around her.

I got home and took a package for Z inside and dad said he‚Äôd put presents under the tree. I was surprised. I think I‚Äôll look whenever I make it through this chaotic week.

Almost was late leaving for work because my hair wouldn‚Äôt stay in a bun. Work was pretty average. I like talking to Alex there, I‚Äôm glad I got her to work there with me. She brought me the cookies I bought from her, finally.

Came home and sat at the dinner table avoiding doing homework for an hour. I need to finish my independent project and have some sketches for my art project.

I took a shower and cut four small cuts in my leg just because I was bored and wanted to watch it bleed. It stung in the shower and it bled really nicely with the water. I about gave myself shock when I tried to rinse my hair with freezing cold water.

I came back to my room. F saw the rest of my public insta story about random shit. Then I started writing today‚Äôs entry.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through winter break without him or my friends or even my church friends. I‚Äôm excited for Christmas though. I hope I get those new shoes and I hope that I get those earrings! I‚Äôm so excited aaaa! But I‚Äôm kinda stressed too. Gonna wake up early to cut my bangs real short and study for my algebra final.

I fucking love sleeping though."

That's the plan for now I'll be working at some new place in the meantime I guess. My main clients are not available at the moment because of the holidays so it should help.

You know I have realized something very important that I should have a long time ago. Id say more but my services raked in what they could today going to bed now.

Hi. It's been a month since I last updated. In my last post I mentioned that there was a mass found in my uterus.

After that, I had an MRI done and two more ultrasounds done. I met my gynecologist today (2nd meeting) and I gave him the results from my examinations.

I have two cysts - one 10cm fibroid cyst in my uterus (but it likes to move around if I sleep a certain way) and an 8cm dermoid cyst in one of my ovaries.

Those cysts were causing me issues and pain for months. The weight and pressure of the bigger cyst was weighing down my uterus and it was causing me pelvic pain.

I had mistaken the pains to be urinary tract infections for a few months because it feels very similar and the similarities were: pain where I pee, tightness in the pelvic area, urinary incontinence (no control over keeping pee in, leaking on the underwear), and urinary frequency (peeing many times and the feel of needing to pee even when there's no urine).

I had corrected this by doing my own physical therapy, which was doing exercises I found off youtube that best worked for me. I stuck to one thing and kept at it every night and day and it took about 3 months to finally get the pain to go away. Sometimes it hurts but not badly.

Anyway back to the gynecologist. He told me the dermoid cyst replaced my left ovary and should the cyst by removed, so will my ovary. Due to the size of dermoid cyst, surgical excision is the only possible way to safely get rid of it. He said I could also leave it alone and do another ultrasound and see if it gets bigger. But it causes me pain in my side so I am opting to get rid of it.

It's a huge thing to me because I don't want to lose my ovary. I'm sad that I'll have a harder chance to conceive, but it's better to still be able to than to have a hysterectomy and have none at all. It's so ironic because I thought I'd be okay without children and didn't plan on having any, but the thought of having that chance in case I do change my mind taken away... well it's sad. At least 1 ovary will remain.

Why does the female body have to be so stupid and complicated?

This past month I also didn't know if I had cancer or not, but the good news is that I don't have cancer. It's the best news out of all of this.

I also have more of a support network now and people have been really kind to me and I appreciate it so much. I can't count how many times I've cried because of my health issues, not knowing what was going on, being brushed off, ignored, not taken seriously, thinking I was alone, dealing with the pain, dealing with the drop in work ethic because of my issues, news after news... it really impacted my quality of life in different ways. It's such a relief that this is just a hurdle I will live through.

I am not the same me I was a year ago. Next year I will be me with additional scarring and minus an ovary, but alive. I am hopeful things will look up after that."
0,"RESET DAY 21: OTHER PEOPLE
Uuugh 17 days.

I've known for a while but I really dislike living with other people. They're so... Annoying. Like 1 I didn't ask for your shit so 2 don't ask me to take care of them. Like I've made it pretty obvious I hate those little shits.


Anywho that put me in a bad mood so I might try and self harm tonight or tomorrow. Probably not going to be able to but at least I'll try lol. I also got tegaderm which is suppose to be good for Burns so that's a good thing I guess. I got it for my tattoo because it HELPS SO MUCH. Like in a week it was basically healed and ready to go. The bruising was terrible but it went away after 3 or 4 days.

I wanna hurt myself. Like the release of endorphins is amazing and would be perfect right now. I'd feeling like nothing matters and fall asleep like a baby???"

Was too tired/busy to post a diary entry over the weekend. Nothing particularly exciting happened except for me breaking down Sunday afternoon because F ended a sentence with a period. I‚Äôm a loser. I also got 100$ worth of printmaking supplies I plan to go to town on during winter break.

‚Äî-

I woke up this morning late and barely got ready in time. I wore my blue sweater black jeans and boots. I still need to get my laundry from the basement.

As I was sitting by the door waiting for it to be 7:03 to leave, dad came in and was like ‚Äúyou jammin out?‚Äù Seeing my earbuds. He said ‚Äúlistening to some John MacArthur?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply but gave a nervous sarcastic laugh. I think he knows that I listen to music but I don‚Äôt know to what extent.

Put my coat in my locker and Mrs. H said ‚Äúso no pizza socks today?‚Äù Sarcastically. I laughed and said something dumb back and went to the cafeteria to my usual spot. I don‚Äôt think F noticed me. J came over and talked to me like usual and she always is saying how she has no friends at school right in front of me to my face. I mean we‚Äôre not really friends but what an asshole thing to say. I wish she‚Äôd leave me alone in the mornings I just want to sit by myself and cry.

I went to history and wrote the next half of my Independent project which was due 3rd hour. I did the same thing in math. In math I got an email from Mrs. HR to do the boys basketball poster. I started on it and worked on cropping the players during presentations third hour. Mrs. A made really good sugar cookies for us.

I presented and was really nervous and couldn‚Äôt talk for most of my presentation until I started reading the excerpt. When I got to my writing it felt so natural and beautiful even though my voice was a little shaky.
I was happy with it in the end but I was a bit mad at myself for being so nervous.

4th and 5th hour I continued working on the basketball poster. In 5th I talked to Z about college and shit. I feel so obnoxious when I talk about it. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve convinced myself so much so if the fantasy of college that I‚Äôll be completely devastated if I don‚Äôt go the way I want to.

I went to lunch and waited for F but he never came into the cafeteria to my knowledge. I ate quickly and sat outside of his room.

art portfolio was pretty weird. F told us about our due dates and said he‚Äôd post the final tonight. I never talked to him once the whole hour. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do without him over the break. Two weeks without F. I don‚Äôt think I can do it.
Log talked about birds and I started missing by birds bad. I started like full on crying and it was bad. I don‚Äôt know if F noticed or not. I even miss Louie. Fuck, ugh I miss them so much what the hell I wish my dad allowed pets.
I wanted to go cut myself so bad and then I remembered I don‚Äôt even have my fucking blades.

7th hour was boring as shit except that Alex came in and we talked and she said that Ellie was there visiting and saying hi. I wanted to go say hi but I didn‚Äôt want to go to F‚Äôs room just to say hi.

I messaged the zine club group me to see if we were meeting because I desperately wanted to hang out in F‚Äôs room after school.
F replied ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Aug canceled.
I saw Ellie briefly in the hallways and said hi for a sec.

I went to F‚Äôs room and chatted with M and R and H for a couple minutes. I‚Äôm so excited to have 7th hour with them!!!! I love them so much they are so great! I sat down and decided I‚Äôd get to work on folding my big stack of zines. F was busy with the other Alex and crew.

Out of nowhere Log comes back from the bathroom and hands me the pencil pouch Mrs. Bro gave to me last year that I‚Äôd lost. I was dumbfounded and couldn‚Äôt believe it was in there. How long had it been in there??? I haven‚Äôt seen it since last year! It‚Äôs a fucking mystery I tell you. I was glad to see it, and I miss Mrs.Bro too.

F had to go take a phone call and was gone for 20 to 30 minutes. I was alone with Audrey and I kept folding all my zines and I talked to her about her printing she was doing.

When she left and F came back from his call there were only like 5 minutes before he had to leave. I started packing up my crap and he asked me if I was stressed about finals. I said not really and that I was more stressed by the other assignments I had to get done that weren‚Äôt finals. He agreed and started talking about how his generation and older generations didn‚Äôt give a shit about finals and weren‚Äôt so worried all the time about the future and college and stuff. He made some really good points and I completely agreed. It was kind of a rant and it was nice to have him actually talk to me. He makes me so happy I can‚Äôt even fully describe it.
He said that someone had to look out and stick up for the teenagers and it was really sweet.

As I was heading out the door he said ‚Äúsorry I didn‚Äôt mean to go on a rant!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye S‚Äî‚Äî!‚Äù
And I said oh no you‚Äôre fine all weird and said bye back. He‚Äôs so fucking nice I love him so much he‚Äôs the best person in the whole world.

I went and sat on the stairs in my coat waiting for dad and he drove by and he just smiled so big it made every ounce of me feel pure joy. He is fucking magical.

I went straight to work right after dad picked me up and I went and did my etraining and tests. The tests were hard at first and I talked to D a bit in the office. They got super busy when I needed to ask AD something so I left and said I‚Äôd be working tomorrow and could figure it out.

I came home and now I‚Äôm writing this.
I wanna get to work on some stuff. I might update this later, I just wanted to get this out of the way before I forgot for a third day in a row.


EDIT: yeah I did try to get stuff done when I realized I still had all of moms old text conversations on my iPad. I thought they were gone forever. I had s big breakdown and cried a lot. Something broke in me and I was sick of letting mom fade into the past and I want people to fucking know what I deal with every day and I posted about it to my close friends insta story. I took it down and rewrote some shit about how I miss her and how you should tell your parents you love them more than they tell you. "

Today went by pretty fast I feel. I did a good amount of preping for my exam tomorrow which makes me feel a bit better about it. Going to study a bit more tomorrow before the test of course. I am more worried for my last final on Tuesday though than I am for the one tomorrow. I will be so close to being able to 4.0 my first semester. I can do it, I just got to buckle down and finish strong, I can do that. I had some bad thoughts a bit while studying but I did my best to ride them out and they went away by and large eventually. I didn't play any games today that I remember although I should have. I ended up still wasting a good bit of time doing stuff that wasn't even all that fun. I am going to shower and sleep.

A quick post for last night. Just going to type something up. Yesterday went pretty well I feel. I went to work which felt like a long shift for some reason, but I also felt like I had a ton of time in the afternoon to do fun stuff. I ended up playing a lot of smash bros and splatoon which I liked. I don't know how to play smash bros though and that was frustrating me :p I also watched some UFC fights last night which were good. The last FOX card, the end of an era. I can't believe that was 7 years ago. Where does the time go? I  don't recall having much issues with anxiety yesterday. Alright, that's all for now."

You know, I don't want much in life. Just the simple sappy things. Caring husband, a kid or two, definitely about 3 dogs...

But what I want right now: I want to be in someone's arms. HIS arms, to be exact. I want to feel safe and loved and cared about. I want to be able to reach up and kiss whenever I want. I want to fall asleep to his snores. I want to wake up on Christmas to him smiling at me. I love his smile, even though he hates his. I want to look him in the eyes and tell him how I feel. That I dont remember the last time I've felt this longing in my chest, the crushing weight of him missing. I want to feel his hand on my face, tracing my cheek with his thumb... I want to dress up and have him in complete awe and we dance the night away. I want him on bad days, good days, to be the one he finds comfort in as I do in him.

Most of all, I want to tell him all this...

...and for him to say it back."

So what am I now? You don't want to tell me about what's going on in your life knowing damn well in that handsome head of yours that I want to know everything.

Why should I give a shit or ask if all the conversation would be is an interview? Why would I do that to myself? And it's not like you give a shit about me, don't lie, it's insulting.

&#x200B;

I feel so irrelevant. Like when I first met you I wasn't in the greatest place. Then you came along and took my hand and what a whirlwind it was, showing me there's so much to life, making me feel so loved like never ever before. And now that you've left me, I've started feel more and more like I'm back in the same place. Only this time I'm alone to help myself. It's fine. I'll figure it out. I always do.

But that doesn't make any of this okay. Yes I broke promises but nothing like the ones you broke when you told me this could never work out.

The one that no one will have, that no one wants. That's how I feel. Something tells me even if ""I find someone else"" that this feeling won't go away ever-- or for a long, long, long, time. So thanks for that. Thanks for all you taught me, genuinely, but also for leaving me with lifelong pain. At least I now know what it means to love, unconditionally. Maybe I know what to look for in the future, right?

This whole thing will never go away, as much as I want it to you. Maybe you can live with the satisfaction of that. Of knowing just how much you once meant to me. And no matter how utterly betrayed I feel, a trace of that will always remain. "

I don't feel good about the holidays, I just feel like shit. And on top of everything I feel like I don't have anyone to just rant to about it, so I guess that's why I'm posting here.

&#x200B;

When I first moved in I never even unpacked the 3rd room, because it became the catchall for everything that wasn't ready yet. I gutted my kitchen earlier in the year and now I can't even walk into that room. Worst yet there's so much overflow it has ruined my livingroom and other rooms as well. I don't have time to keep up with basic housecleaning because there is always some extensive project going on, or flatout nowhere to put things while construction is ongoing.

&#x200B;

Well this was supposed to change last month. From the very first of the month I started a countdown to thanksigiving. A 5 day weekend. The kitchen is almost done and I needed those 5 days to make some serious headway without being exhausted from my actual fulltime job. We were gearing up to start decorating at work too. Everything was falling into place.

But then I got deathly sick 2 days before. I had to use PTO I was saving for vacation, on a week where I already almost had every day off because of shit timing.

And then it all went wrong, because I spent the next TWO WEEKS entirely bedridden. It was so bad I actually lost 10 pounds from it. Every day I woke up I kept hoping I'd have the energy, but it just didn't happen. And just like that, my longest home vacation of the year was obliterated by a damn cold.

&#x200B;

After those two weeks, I was completely demoralized. Everyone at work had already done their decorating and now instead of partaking in festivities and enjoying myself, I was working to catchup. I reached a point where I wasn't even going to bother decorating, but then I started getting jokingly insulted at work for being so far behind everyone on the decorations. I brought stuff in, but it was no longer out of seasonal joy, but something I felt pressured to do.


Oh and I found a baby kitten that week I was sick as well. Which added more problems at home, having to gate off sections of my house, parent the pre-existing cat who has turned into the largest brat, and pay for a bunch of vet appointments to get everything koscher with the baby.


Oh and on top of all of this, I've had the fortune of dealing with sales juggling. The sole of my winter boots fell off, so I needed a new pair. It wasn't a big deal, until it was. I thought I could buy a replacement pair on blackfriday. I thought I was being smart by buying a size up, in case the first one didn't fit, so I'd still get the sale price on whichever one I ended up keeping. But then the boot looked nothing like the photos, and I had to return both. Not so bad. at least there's cyber monday? This time I decided to order the same exact boot I had before, same size and everything. First order goes in aaaand... the very next day they send me a 30% off coupon. Well screw you large company who shall not be name dropped, I am damnwell going to re-order my boots for the extra 30% off. Btw, my first order arrived in 3 days. My next 2 orders took over 2 weeks to arrive. You know, when the sales are long finished? And even though I ordered the same boots I had previously, in the same size I had previously... guess what. THEY DON'T FIT. Oh and when I went to return the more expensive pair? They refunded me for the CHEAPER pair. I had to go back just to get it corrected, because even though I was basing off the printed receipt in the box, the QR code on the outside of the box didn't match. Fuck you big retailer, fuck you.

&#x200B;

At home, I've managed to finally catch up on things. But I don't feel good about it. I have my christmas shopping done, but I don't feel relief. On the night I was getting stuff ready to bring into work, I managed to somehow clearout the livingroom enough to put up my own decorations. It felt good for a whole minute but of fucking course there is shit everywhere not even a week later. There's bags and boxes everywhere, some from returns, some from just living and not having time to clean up after myself, some from the ongoing construction, etc. I just don't have time for this. I was supposed to be done 2 weeks ago, but then I got sick. Now the big finish to the project is overlapping with christmas and it's a nightmare. I can't relax, I can't unwind, I can't even enjoy decorations because it's surrounded by a mess. Feels like my boyfriend and I are drifting apart, when this is the very same holiday that solidified our relationship after we first met last year. I don't want to have to go to family's houses. I don't want to have to commit time from my schedule to accomodate these traditions right now. I am too swamped. I just feel like absolute shit. And I want it done. I want to be able to clean. I shouldnt have to choose between christmas and painting, but here it fucking is, all because of that goddamn cold. I was in the holiday mood before I got sick, but this was a setback I could not afford, and now I am paying the price.

Is this text here just optional? That's weird. Today was pretty good. Had some bad thoughts earlier but all is fine and well now at the end of the day. Had an exam today that went really well I felt. I also worked and made a bit of money which is always good. I am soooo tired though, I have been since the afternoon. I tried to close my eyes a bit before work even. Her and I watched a good bit of Dr. Who today which was ok. I feel like the episode we watched is a big deal but it didn't impact me a ton because I haven't seen all of the previous doctors.  I also am quite far in my next book now and could finish it tomorrow if I wanted to. Depending on what I do at work I just might try and do it then? During the morning? Not a bad idea at all actually. Well, that's all for now. Time for sleep."

Jesus, time is flying fast.
My life has become a repetitive blur,
it just repeats itself over and over and over and over until I have a mental breakdown and restart the cycle.

I feel like the only way to break it is to talk to F.

...

Went to school like usual. Sat down in my spot LIKE USUAL. Jeana came up and talked to me a bit. I don‚Äôt remember what about. We talked and I was a bit spaced out.

I decided not to do my roaring 20‚Äôs essay. I could make up for those missing points with the final to keep my B.

Same with math, I helped Zach cheat on his mastery, and I helped myself. He‚Äôs like the only chill person I can cheat with.

I forgot that we were presenting or independent projects in 3rd hour. I asked to go Monday. I‚Äôm screwed if I don‚Äôt write and record tomorrow or Sunday. I‚Äôll probably do it Sunday instead of making a zine. :(

Started watching American Vandal. It‚Äôs funny as hell. Watched that through 4th-5th hour.
Missed F in the cafeteria. I went in after he was already leaving. Fuck me, I‚Äôm a moron.

I didn‚Äôt do much 6th hour. F sarcastically asked me if I watched the Chiefs game and I said I‚Äôm sooo sorry and that I‚Äôd checked the score during half time and that‚Äôs why they lost. He said he was like, damn, S‚Äî‚Äî- must have watched the game, when the Chiefs lost. I was glad he thought of me, that made me really happy, even if it was just the Chiefs losing.

Later in class he asked me if I had made anything at home or if I‚Äôd started my social commentary piece. I did my awkward shrug and said not really. Before he could really reply someone changed the subject and I continued to stare at the reflection of the ceiling light in the tray of water.

Then I checked my email because my phone buzzed and I got an email from Julie saying I got accepted into the art show. I verbally said ‚Äúoh wow. I got in this art show, holy cow‚Äù and Log and F and I briefly talked about the show. It‚Äôs really not that competitive anyways and I talked to Darby and Log about my sisters ugly painting that made it in as well. Maybe I have a chance if their crap made it in. Who knows.

Didn‚Äôt do shit in 7th hour.

I posted to my story about the Chiefs thing and the art show.

I went to MYM and awkwardly sat next to Log. Everyone was in a good mood. I wish I were a senior so I was closer to everyone here but I don‚Äôt want to be a senior for many reasons.
Their question of the week was where is your very specific favorite place to be.

My answer was walking to the grocery store right after sunset for a grape soda and some chocolate covered raisins and sitting along the cemetery drinking my soda before I walked back because it looks like a beer can and my road is busy. I didn‚Äôt say the last part, but it‚Äôs just for personal context. Everyone gave thoughtful answers. Jana shared the store about the drama that happened in photo with Margot.

Apparently Margot said something racist like go back to your country and everyone got really pissed at her and there was an argument. But from Jana‚Äôs perspective, it looked like some poor girl on the autism spectrum was being bullied. No Jana. Margot is a dumbass racist cunt. I do think people were being a bit rude openly talking about her behind her back and I wanted to tell Jeana and Logan that but I didn‚Äôt really completely.

After all that drama, we had a meditation circle. With music and mood lighting and we all sat in a circle and did breathing exercises and closed our eyes and sat in silence. It was so peaceful and I felt a little awkward mostly because Glenn was there but then I realized he‚Äôs just a senior I barely know and I don‚Äôt give a shit about him. The silence and idea of trying to clear my thoughts really made me scared and sad. I feel like my brain is always running 90 MPH since mom died because every time my mind actually goes blank I think of her. Not that I don‚Äôt want to think of her, it just makes me cry. And I did. I got a fat tear out and not much more. I hoped F saw but I think he was on instagram. I think he saw my story about the Chiefs and art thing then.

After MYM was over I sat outside with my poofy jacket that covered half my face for like 20 minutes until F passed by. I got really sad thinking about mom. I made myself almost sob. I was pretty rough. Zach from math and some guy walked by and he said hi Sydni and I said hi. It was so awkward, I hope he didn‚Äôt realize I was crying.

F finally passed by and gave a hearty wave and smile and I can‚Äôt remember if I smiled or not back. My tears had dried up by then and moments later dad pulled into the parking lot.

We went home and I made some soup and some bacon and I got ready for work real quick and had about 20 minutes spare time to cut my legs. It sounds so fucking sick. Oh Yeah, and I cut myself in the bathroom at school. You‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be a bigger detail but it really isn‚Äôt to me. It‚Äôs just become a part of the daily routine and it sickens me, but not enough. So I cut myself when I got home for not crying enough when F passed by and for me continuing in this cycle maybe ruining my chances before break. I don‚Äôt know. I cut a good amount of long ones. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve cut too many below my shorts line and by summer the scars won‚Äôt completely heal.

I went to work and worked for two hours. Pretty mundane and AD wasn‚Äôt there.

I changed and went to the high school youth group Christmas party. We played fishbowl and Kahoot. it was fun.

I talked to laura on the way back about my promotion at work and I talked to Zoe and hung up my blanket like a canopy and put some fairy lights on top. They kind of look like stars.

I want to continue watching American Vandal but I‚Äôm so tired. I think I‚Äôm just going to enjoy a nice night of sleep. I‚Äôll wake up early and maybe clean/ watch the show.

...

I also love how every day my entries are getting shorter and shorter. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm getting more and more bored with life. All I know is I‚Äôm glad I started doing this. It‚Äôs almost been two weeks since I‚Äôve started and it‚Äôs one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in a long time. I wonder if put together future me ever will read these. Who knows, and if so, you‚Äôve come so far. Congrats.

i‚Äôve been so anxious all day. stressed out by both talking and not talking to my ex. what should/can i say? should i not be talking? i honestly don‚Äôt know. even if i just don‚Äôt talk, that causes me anxiety.

i hate you for what you did. but i still love you. and it kills me. i want to detach. i want to move on. i want to be comfortable talking to no one.

i‚Äôm annoyed that i feel like we addressed a lot my issues yesterday, but you have so many issues too that need addressing. you need to go to therapy and check yourself but i can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to force you. but this isn‚Äôt my fault. you still hung out with this other woman today that is a fucking train wreck.

I kept thinking how to use English every day since I woke up this morning. Then I found I should combine English with my favorite things ----- writing physics articles. I have a physics Wordpress. It's called [Understanding(ÊÇüÁêÜ)](https://www.ethanideas.url.tw). I post lots of articles about physics education, history and philosophy of physics and some papers translations in there. Needless to say, I should create a blog. I should write physics articles in English. It's so difficult though. In a sense, my vocabulary isn't enough. I can recognize lots of words but it's hard to use them. Anyway, I should create it first. Here's my blog, [My Life as a Physics student](https://ethanideas619908541.wordpress.com). Well, I haven't finished my mathematical physics homework although I read lots of English posts on Reddit today. Sometimes I think reading english really wastes my time because it doesn't improve my score in graduate school, but I really love learning English. I've so many feelings that I don't know how to express in English. I've read lots of physics papers and textbooks so that I know how to logically write English arguments but I'm not familiar with expressing my feelings. Anyway, I'll write English diary every single day from now on. I hope it helps. Thanks for reading.

evening thoughts.

i spent all morning anxious as hell because i met up with my ex. long story short, i slept with my cheating ex. he admitted to having sex with someone while we were together. i‚Äôm the only other girl he has been with, so this is pretty fucking shocking. i really wasn‚Äôt expecting full-blown sex okay? maybe just a stupid crush or something. the most fucked up part is this girl has a bf.

it cuts me so deep that he has issues with me and my emotionally stability, and maybe wants to pursue something with this woman who doesn‚Äôt communicate, cheats on her boyfriend, and remains in a toxic relationship where this guy steals money from her? somehow that‚Äôs more appealing than me. somehow he doesn‚Äôt see that she‚Äôs got some emotional baggage as well. but okay.

i mean, in a lot of ways i understand that he felt dissatisfied with the relationship. i was too. and although i strayed and thought i had feelings for someone else, i was always loyal to him while we were together.

all day i was hoping that we would eventually work things out, and maybe even if it‚Äôs not for a few months or even years. but i made a mistake today - a big one. because i don‚Äôt know if that can happen and maybe sleeping with him was just salt in the wound. i wanted one last nice night to remember, one last kiss to remember fondly but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm going to feel that way. the truth is, i plan on spending the time apart from him working on myself and improving. he says he doesn‚Äôt want to attend therapy and i am not sure if he wants to work on himself. if it‚Äôs one-sided, i don‚Äôt see us working. obviously if he finds that he truly doesn‚Äôt love me anymore (which honestly i don‚Äôt think is true), it will also hurt so bad.

this is just one big clusterfuck and i am glad we plan on spending at least a month apart. i need time to really think about everything. i love him, and always will. i respect him even after what he did. i want to spend time rebuilding what is broken and make a life together, but there are so many questions and unknowns. all i can do, is focus on myself. because regardless if my next relationship is with him or someone else, i want/need to be better. i need to change my behaviors. BUT they‚Äôre not all mine that need changing.

man i may be a fool, but that‚Äôs what love does to you."

I had a dream this morning I just forgot to write it down.

I woke up and barely got ready in time to go to QT with dad. I got my stuff ready and my picture of Audrey Hepburn for Mrs. A and went to QT. I got two egg rolls.

Put my present for Mrs. A and my coat in my locker and went to math. I struggled with the stupid thing we did. I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll do on the test tomorrow. Margot told me she‚Äôs buying a 3,500 furry suit. Fucking figures she‚Äôs a furry, what a naive kid. Finished ‚ÄúMoon‚Äù in seminar and went to the library for lunch. Did some accounting and some math and financial planning for the future, and started on a calendar for my phone.

We went through some poems for English. I spent the rest of class finishing up my calendar. It looks pretty sick. It makes me scared for how little time I have. Life is crazy.

Went to art portfolio and talked to Logan and jeana came in and said hi. Mrs. H came in and said she needed to talk to F about a student. We all wondered what happened. I got Log and Darby to go out in the hall to the bathroom and listen in but they did a shitty job of listening. Jeana came back later and told us that Willa had apparently used lead based glaze and may have ruined the kiln and everyone‚Äôs shit.

The only time F talked to me all hour is when he randomly asked if I was watching the Chiefs game. I said probably not because every time we watch a Chiefs game they lose. I told him that I was sparing the Chiefs by not watching and he thought that was pretty funny. I told Log about my promotion but F didn‚Äôt hear. Ughhh.

I went to the bathroom after class ended to wait for the halls to clear and to take a shit. I went up to Freelancer and walked in the door only to remember I left my thing for Mrs. A in my locker downstairs. I walked all the way down and all the way back up and about passed out. I wasn‚Äôt sure Mrs. A liked it that much at first but it really grew on her and she really loved it and she gave me a hug. I love her so much üíï! I helped her hang it up and another picture and made a button and stole one of a cat and she asked me if I had any obsessions like she did Audrey Hepburn. I told her I used to be really into Doctor Who. She said she had some friends who were. I told Jess and some people about my promotion at work and it was exciting and I love that group!

When I left, I saw log in the hallway and said hi and August showed me his book of kitchen Witchery. I left to go sit on the stairs at around 3:30. I watched Log leave and I sat there in the cold on the wet steps emailing and texting Julie about the art competition. I sat there huddled in my bag winter coat that covered my face up to my nose. I felt like a hunch back though. I need to lose weight and fix my posture. At around 3:48, F drive by and he smiled and waved and I tried to smile a little bit back but I realized you couldn‚Äôt see my mouth because of my coat. I felt like an idiot.

I didn‚Äôt cry. I wasn‚Äôt sad. I brought this on myself anyways. Dad picked me up and we drove home. He always says, ‚Äúhow‚Äôs S‚Äî‚Äî- doing?‚Äù Like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong, but I thought my acting was alright. I‚Äôm always good at acting though.

I got home and cut like one little cut on my leg. My blade was dull. I stole another pencil sharpener from school so it was all good. I went on to get the screwdriver and take out the blades later tonight.

I rearranged my entire room except for my dresser. My bed is no longer close to the window. I really like my new layout. I like how clean and organized my desk is. I pinned up a pamphlet from the art college and circled and drew arrows pointing to the art camp that I‚Äôm working my ass off to get a scholarship for.

I took a photo of my feet up on my desk and posted it to my Instagram. It was cool. F liked my photo and I felt so proud. I ate dinner and did more cleaning crap.

My sister decided she wanted to download a bunch of old iPhone games so I helped her a tiny bit. Laura cooked some bacon and I ate a few pieces. I went to my room to go to bed and now I‚Äôm writing this.

Claire just responded to my insta story about Mrs. A. I‚Äôm going to text her back now. I miss her so much.

Trying to resist cutting myself for the sake of cutting myself. It‚Äôs so hard when I have new blades though.

0,"Day 1 - Introduction
I'm not a native speaker but I want to practice English writing, so I come here creating a post. My name is Ethan. I'm 28 and studying my master's degree on nanoelectronics research. I'm constantly thinking how to practice English. It's difficult because I don't have much time. This morning, I had a solid-state physics class. Its loading is heavy. Besides, I have other two lectures, which are ""MOS capacitor device"" and ""Mathematical Physics."" Both of them are very difficult. I need lots of time reading book and writing homework. Apart from that, I also want to do lots of things. Well, that should leave to the future post.

&#x200B;

Back to the main topic. Today I read a little bit Michelle Obama's new book. It's easy to read. I kept thinking whether it is possible to study english every day when I read her book. I didn't pay attention to the lecturer. He is an old professor. I don't like him because I know he often prides oneself on being a veteran. After class, I went to library and tried to finish my mathematical physics homework. But I failed. I started thinking about the meeting contents with my advisor next Monday. My topic is designing a single-photon detector using avalanche photodiode. My current task is modeling the IV curves, finding the approximate SRH recombination and Hurkx tunneling current formulas. Well, it's not easy. I thought I've finish 50%. Although I want to focus on research, I was still distracted by other thoughts, like practicing English.

&#x200B;

Well.....it's so hard to write more. Let me finish this here. I hope I can continue writing diary tomorrow :)"
0,"Evening rant
Today was a day.
I didn't say as much stupid stuff as I normally do. So that's good.

I actually got up and went to swim practice this morning. That was decent. It was a rough workout but I liked it over all.

Work was fine. I realized I was unnecessarily throwing my boss that I like under the bus to our higher boss for literally no reason. It felt like I was doing it mostly out of immaturity and fucked up parental influences.

I am constantly thinking about my shitty amount of credit card debt and I'm not even done with Christmas gifts. I want to wait until after Christmas/tax return to figure out how bad it really is. Then fiance and I can talk about it. I think our blossoming hobbies just got out of control but I think we've reached a point where we can taper off for several months and I can fix this.

I've been working on the big present for my fiance in the garage and am making good progress so it should be done in time. He's going to love it.

My roommates boyfriend still continues to suck and be not great to her. He really doesn't appreciate her. It just grates on me because I love her as a sister and I hate to see someone take advantage of her kindness. I can't believe she still hasn't finished her master's degree even though she is so close to finishing it. Her anxiety and his discouragement is so strong and rooted in his own failure to finish his master's degree.

It's hard to deal with his mansplaining and his generally arrogance. I'm horrible at hiding my feelings from people when I don't like them.

My neice is still struggling with where to go to college and I am trying to figure out how to tell her parents she should come live with me and do community college for a year for the transfer scholarship and, little do they know, more relaxed time to get her mtf transition process started. I think my fiance is still a little uncomfortable with her living here but I'm pretty sure she will stick to herself and the little bit of rent will be helpful in us saving for a wedding.

Ugh. I should go to bed. I'm carpooling with my roommate tomorrow instead of going to swim because her car is straight up dead and I want to minimize the miles she puts on our other car.


I try to be a good person. I wish I could be as nice to myself as I am to others. I really need to work on my selfdiscipline. I'm going to require I go to swim at least once a week because that makes it so I'm paying 11 dollars a practice. Then once roommate gets a new car I will go twice a week. It's hard.

The kittens call me to go to bed. I should go now."

morning thoughts.

wow. it‚Äôs been a week since i‚Äôve started. i‚Äôve been working so hard on improving myself and even my therapist seems impressed. i‚Äôve learned so much.

I am going to keep journaling about my anxiety, and finding ways of self-care. i am focusing on remember that i need to be my first priority.

evening thoughts.

i can‚Äôt sleep. i am meeting up with my ex tomorrow just to talk. i am so grateful to see him again but also very nervous. not sure if it is the best idea, but i don‚Äôt want to talk about anything too serious. we don‚Äôt need to, really. i just want to talk to my friend.

i realized today that because we were long distance and i had a mental breakdown the day you left, i don‚Äôt remember our last kiss. i don‚Äôt know why this hurts so much, but it does. "

I dreamt this morning I just couldnt remember anything to write it down.

I woke up at 5 and by 5:20 freaked out because I thought I didn‚Äôt have time to shower and get ready. I thought it was 6:20 not 5:20 and showered and got almost completely ready before realizing at 5:50 that I had a whole other hour to get ready. So I curled up in bed and about fell asleep again.

I listened to an old HBM podcast I downloaded on the bus. It was exactly 20 minutes long. Perfect. I got to school and went to my spot in the cafeteria and sat there alone for a good 5-7 minutes before Jeana came over and had to talk to me about work and life and shit. We both god really excited about how much we both like our jobs and how much they‚Äôve helped us socially and shit. I‚Äôm glad she can confide in me although she can be a little touchy and huggy for my taste.

We finished the Great Gatsby in history. I watched a movie called circle on Netflix in first and third hour. And started another one called Moon.

We went on our field trip. I rode shotgun in the van with Mr. B. The museum of illusions was pretty cool not gonna lie. We came back and had good pizza. I took a test in 7th hour which sucked and I‚Äôm sure I failed but I don‚Äôt care. I just want to pass at this point.

Art club was awkward as hell. I‚Äôm sad this is the last one till next semester! I sat down a seat away from Log who was talking to F about his projects and missing ones etc. Somehow F knew about my field trip and asked where I went and if it was fun. Pretty short convo honestly. I sat there doing nothing looking like a sad idiot for the rest of the hour almost. F talked about his plans to work with ITKC next semester. I‚Äôm excited and he kept mentioned to talk to him or me if anyone had ideas. I felt really proud, he makes me so happy. I wanted to tell Logan about my promotion when F was around but I never got the chance. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow I just want F to know for some reason.

I sat there by myself talking to Athena awkwardly for the rest of the time. She‚Äôs so fucking weird what the hell. She was like talking about her supposed anxiety and I‚Äôm like bitch u have no anxiety you‚Äôre just a creepy kid who doesn‚Äôt know how to use the internet. I left without F even seeing me leave or saying goodbye. I cried and sat down on the stairs outside waiting for dad. He showed up right as F was backing out. I think he turned to look as I was walking to my car. I don‚Äôt know. We pulled out onto the road at the same time almost and were waiting at the intersection close to each other for a good while. I wonder if he saw me.

I got home and my sister talked to me about the local art show and I decided to submit something last minute because why not. I went through the drama of getting a good picture and submitting it and all that crap and had pizza for dinner. I got it submitted and posted to my story about missing 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take or something. Which I know that is F‚Äôs email signature, but it‚Äôs such a widely used quote so it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm a stalker creep.

I did cut one cut on my ankle. It wasn‚Äôt crazy deep but I feel empty if I don‚Äôt make at least one a day.

Youth group was alright. We had our youth group American idol. It was just me, Ali and Sarah and we sang a parody song of ‚ÄúI want a hippopotamus for Christmas‚Äù but it was ‚ÄúI want a new youth pastor for Christmas‚Äù we won and made the junior senior guys jealous and mad as hell. We ate our chocolate cake prize in the kitchen with plastic forks until I got sick.

Came home and helped my sister submit and watched her make a fool of herself.

And F replied to my insta story about the art show, ‚ÄúGo S‚Äî‚Äî!!!‚Äù I felt so proud it made me beam! I fucking love that man so much he makes me feel like a million bucks.

It was a pretty good day overall except for me fucking social awkwardness around F and the club. I really need to work on that, but I‚Äôm afraid if I talk too much I‚Äôll embarrass myself. But when I talk to little I hate myself too. Either way I go home and cut myself. I need a new fucking coping mechanism this isn‚Äôt working.

I hope I dream tonight. I think if I wake up at the right time I will. I‚Äôll try to write it down ASAP if I do.

First, a post for two days ago. Which would be.... Monday? I think I only worked one job that day? Both jobs? I am not sure. Oh, I remember. I had an ec opportunity that night so I only worked my morning job. The EC thing was kind of interesting actually, and I got to study a good but during it which was nice. After that I stayed at my grandmas and studied there. Made some questionable decisions while there but you live and you learn. Having some issues with bad thoughts at the moment. Will take some deep breaths and focus on this studying. I ended up doing alright on my final exam. I didn't do great honestly, but I did well enough for what I needed from the class. I didn't have to work my other job that day so I went home and got 2 of my projects done! Or so I thought. I realized this morning that I made a major mistake in my video project and had to refilm it. I also studied a good bit today, viewed an apartment that Her and I both liked, played some video games, and relaxed. Not a bad day. I am feeling anxious about some of my finals though. My one tomorrow doesn't worry me too much, but the ones after that do. Ugh. Alright, that's all for now. Back to studying."

 I gets real boring working at a phone repair shop all day the duration of 13 hours in one day is exhausting.

i got lazy to write here again. yesterday the coworker that wanted me to come in jokingly gave me a hard time because i didnt answer my phone to come to work. i honestly didnt care.  one of my coworker edd was jokingly talking crap about me to one of the baggers and i grabbed his id badge and threw it on the ground. he told me im very childish. that hurted.  he made me mad and i retaliated. plus i text him and he never replies. im deleting his number out my phone. fast forward to today. i was off from work and i didnt do anything except go for a walk and play pokemon on my nintendo 3ds.  in the game i got my first shiny and the pokerus virus. that never happened before. now im more addicted to it.  just need more pokemon friends to share my joy with.

i texted stephen today. he is the one that got suspended. i figure i keep him company while being off. im honestly starting to like him more. he says he thinks about me alot and im doing the same. um craving his butt sooo bad. i even thought about kissing him. he would be a good boyfriend but i also want someone strong physically and emotionally. maybe two boyfriend would be fun.

morning thoughts.

i have been still coming to terms with everything i put you through. i was a terrible girlfriend, and i did so many terrible things. i want you to forgive me, but it is important for me to forgive myself. I can then move forward to ensure these things do not happen. i need to call myself out, evaluate my feelings, and come from a place of love and no anxiety.  itsn‚Äôt it crazy that even as an engineer/logical person, i act far too often on emotion. or maybe i don‚Äôt. maybe i think things over too much, and get anxious and do something terrible because I have overthought it. that sounds a lot more like me.  stop overthinking. say how you feel. it‚Äôs okay to feel certain ways, you don‚Äôt need to hold it in. you don‚Äôt need to lie to everybody. give them space. grow yourself. love yourself. stay strong.

evening thoughts.

sometimes are easier, but most times i‚Äôm just hoping you‚Äôre thinking of me and wishing you could take back everything. i keep feeling like we were meant to me but apparently we weren‚Äôt. what you said to me killed me inside and i just can‚Äôt pick myself up from having trusted you and put so much into our relationship. if you didn‚Äôt feel that you loved me, why didn‚Äôt you say so? why didn‚Äôt you say you didn‚Äôt see us ending up together? why were you hanging out with someone new and not telling me?

one day, this will be for the best. and a lot of times i already feel that way. but damn it hurts. it‚Äôs hard to focus on self-improvement being home. i feel like i‚Äôm just very often distracting myself from everything.i don‚Äôt know what to say anymore. i just feel the same way over and over."

I dreamt this morning barely, but I couldn‚Äôt remember it. Probably because I didn‚Äôt get to bed till later.

Blasted my music on the bus and went to put my coat at my locker. Mrs. H asked if I was cold when she saw my socks and sandals. I wasn‚Äôt. It was kind of nice out.

I went to the cafeteria like normal and sat down where I usually sat. Sometime between yesterday and this morning F saw my Instagram story about idiot club. Ugh. I‚Äôm such a weirdo. But I was totally manic when I wrote that.

Continued the great Gatsby in history.. did some math in math.. I turned in my independent study course sheet to my counselor.. worked on my Christmas list instead of my independent project.. didn‚Äôt do much in English.. pretty average day honestly.

I went to lunch and got in line after F did. He said hi and I said hi and we went our separate ways getting lunch. I went to go get ketchup hoping to pass him again but he didn‚Äôt and left. He looked over where I usually sat though, but he didn‚Äôt know I was way behind him.

I finished lunch a lil early and went to 6th hr. I didn‚Äôt do much of anything besides listen to my music and look at memes. I try not to have high hopes for Tuesdays.. they are boring as hell. F asked me to help him and davin hang up inventions from his drawing 2 class. Mr. H came up and said hi briefly before going into the bathroom to probably bust some vapers. The bell rang and I went back to grab my stuff. When walking to class I stopped and asked F a question about the screen printer and then I went to 7th hr.

We watched videos on eels and got really off task. I hope the test isn‚Äôt tomorrow or else I‚Äôm fucked.

Blasted my music on the bus ride home and to the door. I left my coat at school. It wasn‚Äôt that cold though. I just hope it isn‚Äôt tomorrow. There were little pastries in a bag on the porch which I took inside they were for dad and L. I heated up some cheesy corn and ate it on the toilet and went back to my room.

I had the urge to cut so bad‚Äî not a ton, just one good line. Maybe two. And I did. I cut 2 lines midway on my thighs. I don‚Äôt even do it because I feel emotional pain anymore. I just cut because it feels good and I like to watch myself bleed. I finished getting ready for work and I got there feeling pretty good.

Work is the only place I know I‚Äôll talk to people. I really enjoy it now. Especially with my manager and Alex and people. Even some of the customers are nice except for the drooling weird old lady. My manager later told me that he wanted to talk to me about something. I followed him back to the office. I wasn‚Äôt worried really, but deep down I got a little nervous, but who isn‚Äôt when they are called to talk to someone in private. He told me to pull up a chair and he told me that he thinks I‚Äôm good at what I do and that I pretty much know everything about frontline. He told me he wanted to make me a trainer if it was alright with me, he said he might be able to work out more pay too. I was excited and so honored that he would ask me! Finally my hard work and loyalty had paid off. All I need to do is complete some more Etraining and I can start! I hope it all works out. I‚Äôm gonna try to start Monday after school because I‚Äôm way too busy this week with homework and studying.

I ordered some food and waited for like 15 minutes because I put the wrong button on the machine. Good going!!! Ugh. I told dad about my possible trainer promotion and he didn‚Äôt really give a shit. He never gives a shit. He doesn‚Äôt care about me or my life anymore except when I do something wrong. I just want him to be excited for me for once. Where the fuck has my dad gone?

I spent the next two hours sending my Xmas list to grandparents and dad and making a music playlist for Nat.

This day flew by. It was so boring except for the whole promotion thing.

Looking forward to my field trip tomorrow and art club. It‚Äôll be fun I hope. I‚Äôm just sad this is the last art club in a long time. Almost a month. I‚Äôm super tired now and I‚Äôll either cut myself or use self control and just go to sleep. Either way, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

Jesus Christ what a fucking boring day.

Woke up early to shower and fold my zines.. my shitty, shitty zines. Sat in bed wet and freezing my ass off until I barely made it out the door on time. It was so cold out. Didn‚Äôt bring my earbuds so sat in silence on the bus trying to keep my hands warm between my legs.

Went to the cafeteria like normal hoping to sit by myself and cry hoping F would see me, but NoOoOoO.. Jeana had to tell me all about how drunk she got Friday night and all the drama that ensued. I was happy she was talking to me and we had a good laugh but I felt so weird with my back to F, knowing he could see me and I couldn‚Äôt see him.

I got called up to my counselors office during 2nd hr. I was kinda nervous and got really anxious even though I knew it was only about taking an independent study next semester. I sat down and tried to explain to her my reasonings for doing so but she stopped me and was like bitch tell me what class you wanna drop. We got it all figured out and I got a little green paper I needed to have F fill out.

I restarted my independent project in creative writing. I didn‚Äôt like the way the story was going before. I adjusted the tone and voice and it sounds a lot better now. Got a lot more work to do on it. Great, just what I need is more homework and shit to get done.

Had a little too much fun in 5th hr with Zach and Mrs. Hair. Looking forward to our field trip Wednesday.

Went to lunch and waited forever at my table for F to go get his food. I thought it‚Äôd be weird if I went in AFTER he got his food and shit. So I decided to go before thinking he‚Äôd come in when I got my food. I was partially right. He came in when I was typing in my code to pay for my food. He was wearing the Art Club shirt and made me smile. I don‚Äôt think he saw me. I went back and ate my chili like a loser at my lunch table.

I snuck into 6th hr early after lunch and got my stuff all settled down. I took off my denim jacket. My scars were exposed but no one looks at my arm that closely, and if they did, I don‚Äôt care. I sat there like a dumbass and made some dumbass comment to Henry about our project. I felt so idiotic. I asked F if he could help me fill out the independent study sheet he said yes. He went to go help some other people and with 15 mins of class left, I went over to ask him if he could help me fill out the sheet. He did. I just sat across from him at my table in silence as he filled out the form. Not a word. I said thanks and he left to help someone else. It was alright in my mind because there was zine club later.

After a failed science test, it was finally zine club time. I walked in a couple minutes late and it was only Aug and Addie and F. We had a few good convos about shitty teenage bands and they kept wanting to see my zine and when they did F was always in the dark room. Eventually fucking annoying little Athena and her shitty freshman friend came in the room playing their ukuleles. I didn‚Äôt mind for the first minute. But the fucking ukuleles didn‚Äôt stop. They started practicing some annoying ass song and I started losing my mind. I fucking hate ukuleles. I went out into the hall to clear my mind of the noisy instruments. No one else, not even F seemed bothered by them really. After one more time of leaving to go to the hall to pretend to take a call, I texted Aug telling him I could t stand the fucking ukuleles. He came out in the hall and I whined about them for a minute or so.

When I went back in the ukuleles still didn‚Äôt stop but I guess I got used to it. I finally gave my zine to Aug and to Addie and Athena and her little friend. It was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done. The fucking awkwardness of sitting there like a fat ugly loser while some of your few peers read your personal and dark story about the death of your birds? It‚Äôs awful. Then F must‚Äôve noticed and asked if I‚Äôd made a zine. I said yeah and laughed my ugly nervous laugh. He asked what the theme was and I said water, I guess, but not really. I told him that I got inspired from the Rene Stout exhibition. He didn‚Äôt really hear me or he thought it was just stupid.

He sat down a seat away from me and read the zine. The awkwardness was unbearable. His expressions are completely blank when he reads my zines. I like that. No fake awhs or laughs. Just looking at it at face value for what it is. I kept laughing too much and I felt so singled out among the outcast freshmen and F. I wanted to leave. I wanted to go scream and bang my head on a locker. But I couldn‚Äôt. Someone asked me if the story was real or not and I said yeah. They almost didn‚Äôt believe me. F asked the same thing later he just worded it differently. I think then he told me about his bird that died when he was young. He told me about how he buried it at the park across the street. He said that whenever he looked out his window he thought of his dead bird and it made him sad. Then apparently one day he watched three boys go over and pee all over it. He said he remembered being so angry and pissed off.

I felt genuinely sorry for him. I could tell that had been a memory of his that‚Äôd been repressed for a long time. Also his  left eye was kind of swollen and looked dark and I couldn‚Äôt stop focusing on it. Strange.

We didn‚Äôt do much else. I left at the same time as Athena and her friend. She commented on my space potato piece in the hallway not knowing it was mine. So I talked to her about it. Then F came out and left for his car and saw me talking about the potato piece. I felt weird because I wouldn‚Äôt have brought it up. The scenario made it look like I was showing off my piece. Athena asked if it was made with real potatoes and I saw F kind of laughing or what I thought him to be laughing as he walked off. I laughed too because of the inside joke about the potatoes and said something like ‚ÄúHAHAHAH he knows all about the potatoes‚Äù and laughed like a weirdo.

I ran out to sit on the steps as quickly as I could. There really was no point in looking too sad and crying when I‚Äôd just been laughing kind of. But I genuinely was tearing up and already started my daily bullying of myself. I knew I‚Äôd cut when I got home. F passed by but he didn‚Äôt smile and he was on the phone but he waved kind of. I think I initiated the wave too much. Ughhghhh.

I got home and cut away at my leg. Not too many because dad had just texted me saying we were going out to a really nice place for their anniversary dinner. I was scared I‚Äôd bleed through my pants but thankfully I never did. Dinner was pretty average and later after we ate dad mentioned something about being goof to get it 100% free in reference to the art camp and college. I started tearing up because that was never going to be a possibility no matter how hard I worked. Everything costs. And I don‚Äôt give a shit if it costs. I want to go to college so fucking bad. The rest of the trip home was awkward. Dad asked me what was wrong and I said I was fine and he believed me, or at least gave up on trying to talk to me.

I went back to my room and cried some more about shitty parents and art college and life and my uncreativity. I started cutting more but in random places and a kind of deep one above my knee. Well shit. I‚Äôve probably ruined my chances with shorts for a long time until I can figure out how to fix this.

After talking to Milla a little bit and looking st some art I got the confidence to go make some. I measured it all out but I had no ideas when I went to draw. I gave up after a while and went back to bed to write this.

I rediscovered that my creative passion, energy, drive and fuel all come from F‚Äôs praise and instagram. So I‚Äôm trying to get back into the habit of posting. Maybe I‚Äôll dream tonight? It‚Äôs the right time but I‚Äôm so tired I don‚Äôt know if it will work or not. Night shithead. "

I wanted to wake up to your body pressed against mine. I wanted to spend all my time with you and indulge in vacations and trips. In hobbies. Do projects together.

Hell, I even met your family. Extended family, even. They liked me. I liked them. I thought we were cool. I thought waiting a couple years to see you was going to be nothing.

When love is real, a couple years is just time on a clock. It's not that deep. That's all it is. And then after that we'd have our whole lives. We even knew what we wanted to call our kids. I felt fulfilled. Even in moments where I thought I couldn't do it anymore or moments where I wanted to absolutely shout at you over the phone I kept it together.

It's funny. Not ha-ha funny, but weird funny. You can tell someone all your secrets and everything you've ever wondered. Let yourself be utterly vulnerable. Only to be alone again. Completely. Back to square one.

I never gave up on you. Or us.

But I guess you did. "

I dreamt last night like I had hoped. I think I‚Äôve got a system down. I wrote this down after I woke up. It was a weird dream that lasted a really long time. My main takeaway was that F was ignoring me. But I need to remember, it‚Äôs just a dream.

‚ÄúI was working and it was really cold and I don‚Äôt remember much except I opened the door to the patio and made everyone cold and felt bad hen we are at Ali‚Äôs for thanksgiving or some other meal but it wasn‚Äôt her house but F was there. He ignored me the entire time we were there. Someone asked him what he‚Äôd been up to over the weekend and he just said art. It was so weird, the fact that he didn‚Äôt acknowledge my presence whatsoever, not even a glance. Another fragment of the dream I was this weird dark room with lots of other students sitting on the floor. We were all on our computers and I remember something about F still ignoring me. It was weird.‚Äù

Sunday school was finally downstairs for the first time in like 5 weeks. Had decent convos with everyone. Made a joke about the music sounding like we‚Äôre in a Hobby Lobby and everyone laughed because they knew exactly what I meant.

Spent most of the church service looking at the local art colleges website.

Got home, caught up on two episodes of Doctor Who.

Went to Target with the sis and Grandma. Bought myself a lil red purse, some lipstick for my secret Santa gift, and a wallet for my sis. We both bought each other something, she got me earrings, and we agreed the day before Christmas to wrap both our gifts up and pretend like we got each other something.

Hung out with her for like 2-3 hours before the care group potluck. We had a good heart to heart. She opened up to me about her self consciousness about her body. Told me she‚Äôs scared of these ‚Äúlines‚Äù on her hips. Told her those were just stretch marks and completely normal. I would have showed her mind to reassure her, but I didn‚Äôt want to risk her seeing my cuts. We talked about our dreams for the future. I told her all about how High School gets better, I told her about my plans for college. It was good. I haven‚Äôt been able to connect with her like that in a really long time. It emotionally and socially exhausted me. It‚Äôs hard having an extroverted little sister.

I ate a bunch of cheesy corn at the potluck and then retired to my room to work on my zine for tomorrow. The theme was water, I stuck to it loosely but made one about Tucky and Squacker‚Äôs death and burial in the lake. All of my good ideas for zines are about death and burials and funerals and depressing shit. The last two I‚Äôve made mentioned funerals multiple times, with the last one literally being two sisters planning their funerals. I‚Äôm so fucked. I hope F doesn‚Äôt see the correlation but at the same time I hope he does. If he asks about the birds, I‚Äôll say I got my inspiration from the Rene Stout exhibition which isn‚Äôt exactly a lie.

I just love making these little books so much. I love writing out the shit I need to get out and twist them into appropriate stories I wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing with people I respect or my friends. It‚Äôs a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon instead of doing my homework.

I‚Äôm gonna wake up tomorrow, shower, and fold my zines. Hope they turn out.

Probably won‚Äôt dream tonight either, which I‚Äôm sort of bummed about. But it‚Äôs alright. My subconscious is fucking sick either way. "

morning thoughts.

I thought i was doing better yesterday, but I also figured it wouldn‚Äôt last. couldn‚Äôt sleep last night until 3am, woke up twice. had a panic attack. can‚Äôt stop thinking about how you do not love me anymore. i feel unlovable, worthless, and insecure. i feel like i don‚Äôt deserve love. i feel so rejected, 4.5 years doesn‚Äôt warrant a conversation in person? the only thing keeping me okay is thinking that we are going to work this out in the future - but i feel like it‚Äôs unhealthy to set me hopes high. i need to accept that this probably won‚Äôt happen. i should be grateful that we had a good relationship for the first part.  i need to figure out if you were even good for me, because i haven‚Äôt been able to evaluate that yet. i need to set myself straight before i make any big decisions. i think that‚Äôs important to remember - no big decisions, including texting/talking with you.

i need to keep reading my book, read more books, listen to more music, watch more youtube videos, and learn to love myself and be comfortable in my own skin. when i find myself again, then i can be in a relationship. i don‚Äôt know who i am. when people ask me about my hobbies, i get nervous because i don‚Äôt know what to say. what do i do besides school? nothing it seems. what do i like to do - bike? hike? read? watch tv? spend time with my cat? code? volunteer? honestly i feel like i don‚Äôt know. i don‚Äôt even have a sense of style. my closet is mainly plain t-shirts. what even is that?

the real question is who do you even do that, ‚Äúfind yourself.‚Äù i‚Äôm 24 i feel like i should have some idea. i know what music i like. i know that i like to bike/hike but not dedicate every moment to them. i like to cook. how do i feel about things? do i have opinions about things? what does loving yourself even mean? I honestly don‚Äôt know. is it more than acceptance? because i think acceptance is a weak virtue.

i‚Äôve been a shell of a person since i was 14.

midday thoughts.

I‚Äôm realizing that my ex has been in the breakup process for 6 months. when we first broke up, he grieved, and we got back together and he was still always moving on. He‚Äôs 6 fucking months ahead of me and that hurts like hell. he‚Äôs moved on with another woman, and i‚Äôm sitting here grieving. why couldn‚Äôt you just turn me away before. let me move on earlier, before i move 2000 miles from my family and friends. why did you need to prolong this for me.

more midday thoughts.

it became very real that for the past 6 months, even though we were dating, you were busy moving on. You‚Äôve had time to grieve. when I get to where you are, you will be a year in. I have to accept that that is more than enough time for you to move on. we‚Äôre never getting back together. that‚Äôs really had to accept, but i have to. i don‚Äôt have a choice. all i can do is focus on myself. so i cancelled my trip to AZ and bought a flight home today. i‚Äôve never done anything so crazy, but i need to. it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best.

evening thoughts.

I may have jumped a gun and probably spent too much money switching flights, but I am grateful. I am grateful to get to be around the people who love me by tomorrow. I am grateful to catch up with some old pals.

I‚Äôm doing a little better - I had a full blown breakdown this afternoon (hence why I switched my flights), but I have been watching some Coach Craig and it‚Äôs very inspirational. This man is great and I am so happy he has some free content available. Just even to hear some outside opinions is very comforting. I am more convinced now that this was the grass is green syndrome, and I know that my ex will at least question if he made the right decision and that‚Äôs comforting. I do truly believe that another woman cannot stand up to me because we had such an incredible, long, relationship. I understand though - he has never been with anyone else and I get why he needs to see the playing field. I have felt that way too. I know that a lot of this is very overwhelming. I mean, we were talking about marriage when you‚Äôve only been with one person. It‚Äôs scary and you shouldn‚Äôt commit to someone when you‚Äôre not 100% positive. So I think this was the right thing to do. It sucks, but it needed to happen. And if/when he realizes that we had something irreplaceable, we can talk then. If we end up together, I believe that this would only strengthen us. If we don‚Äôt, this will only strengthen me for future relationships or just being alone. there‚Äôs a big positive side to this that I‚Äôm overlooking by my immediate grief and sadness, but that‚Äôs understandable. right now i just need to let myself feel. let myself heal. this month, just do only what i want to do and give myself back the right to say no when something is not good for me. give myself back the freedom i didn‚Äôt have. give myself back myself."

Alright, time for two quick posts. Bit of anxiety today and yesterday but not too bad. I got a bit of work done over the weekend but need to study a whooooole lot tomorrow night. I will probably be up fairly late studying for my exam on Tuesday I'd imagine. And Wednesday and Thursday will be me finally completing my projects. I have a good start on all of my projects now. I just need to finish up one; print, cut, and glue for one; and finally, record the other one. I got a script done for my video project which I think should be enough length. It doesn't say in the description that we need to be in the video ourselves so I think I will just read from my script and record my hands and whiteboard. I should have done a bit more work today. I probably could have studied and finished up two projects. Oh well. Going to study a little more tonight and then sleep. Also, we got a Switch today which is so exciting and I want to play it but I have to refrain until exaaaaams."
0,"day 3 - later night thoughts
I‚Äôm actually doing great. I usually break down at night, but today has been eye-opening and incredible. We broke up not even a week ago, and I‚Äôm already feeling a little better. I‚Äôm feeling grateful I have time to work and focus on myself. I have already learned so much. Maybe this was a blessing - I mean, I know it was. We‚Äôll see if this feeling lasts, but so far I am doing okay without you. I only need me. For this first time in my life, I feel okay with that.

I‚Äôve almost always been in a relationship. I‚Äôm 24 and have been in two 4 year relationships, and 1 one-year relationship. That‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve always had someone intimate to talk to. I‚Äôve been very dependent. But I don‚Äôt need that. I am okay with myself. One day, I will fully love myself and give myself the respect I deserve. I couldn‚Äôt do that when I was in a relationship. I need a few months (or even years) to focus on me. Then I will be ready to be in another relationship.

today was another okayish day. ill do a quick catchup. i visited my sister yesterday. we talked for 20 minutes and then it was just silence. i never was good with conversations.im going to make an effort to see her more often. my coworker added me to a groupchat but so far no one been active. its a good thing because i wouldnt want to talk to them all the time like that. i finally switched to thr $60 plan on metropcs for the amazon prime. turns out some stuff like unlimited music i still have to pay for but at a slightly reduced price.
i need to get this out. so a coworker quit three weeks ago and my manager still has her on the damn schedule.  she fixed it last week but for some reason put her on. im thinking what the fuck is wrong with her? it irritated me because i know they are going to be calling my phone tomorrow asking me to work. its a late shift and the closing manager is a bitch. she is always yelling at me and being rude to me. the head manager is always playing games.  she make me sick. there is not too many people  that can cover the shift. im pretty much the only viable option at this point. it pisses me off because it takes away the chance for me to find a better job. i been there 4 years and i havent quit because i need to have a job that i actually like and can do well. at this point im so angry. i know i might as well take the shift but damn. another reason why i hate my job and everyone there..."

I woke up at 9. I texted Milla about her little date with her crush, it was so cute. I‚Äôm so happy for her.

Went to work, it was pretty average. Trained Alex on how to use the iPad to take temps. Someone flicked my managers hat off and got the first time in over a year I realized he had no hair whatsoever under his hat. We all laughed so hard and I started crying. It was hilarious, I‚Äôve never laughed that hard in my life.

I also made a ketchup packet portrait of Andy.


... Saturday‚Äôs are always uneventful, I think I‚Äôll just review this week as a whole and what my biggest takeaways were.

I‚Äôve decided I need help to stop my self harm and suicidal thoughts. The suicidal ones scared me too bad, and I‚Äôm afraid if left untreated I‚Äôll end up close to death, if not dead.
This makes me so unsettled because I never dreamed I‚Äôd be a cutter, I used to say I‚Äôd never have the guts or the reasons to.. but look at me now. It was only 46 days ago that I‚Äôd made the first cut, now both my thighs are literally completely covered in scars and day old cuts.
I‚Äôm scared that if my suicidal thoughts are left to continue like this, I may attempt someday. Ugh, I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôd never kill myself, it‚Äôs not even an option whatsoever.

Every time I cut, it‚Äôs just a cycle:
- feels good, takes my mind off shit and I feel less shitty about myself
- that night/morning I look at my scabbed wounds and cry wondering why I would do anything so disgusting.
- I look in the mirror later that day and see the sheer amount of scars and cuts and I realize I have a serious problem.
- I start getting sad and kind of try to reach out for emotional support.
- The weekend comes and I forget all about my cuts while working. They no longer shock me, they just are a part of me.
- I feel confident on Monday and wear short sleeves to school.
- And the cycle continues.

In addition to the SH. I‚Äôve realized I enjoy dreaming. It takes my subconscious thoughts and twists them and I kind of like it even though they hurt so bad. I‚Äôm trying to finish this up quick so I can fall asleep now and wake up with a dream. For some reason if I go to bed right at 10 when I‚Äôm still not super tired, I usually dream. I like to interpret them, and find out where they came from. What sick thought or feeling turned into these nightmares.

Weekends help me remember I can make it on my own without me thinking about F, and what he thinks of me all the time. I feel bad when I haven‚Äôt made anything to impress him over the weekend. I know my artistic endeavors shouldn‚Äôt be fueled by his admiration and respect, but they are such a motivator.

I think the real reason I think about him all the time is because first of all, he‚Äôs got a perfect life. He teaches advanced art at high school, AND a super awesome class at the local art college. Even his wife and kids are beautiful, and now that I found out where he lives, even his house is perfect. I still can‚Äôt believe I used to pass it every day and never knew.
Second of all, his art taste is divine, I love how dark and grotesque his forte is and the artworks and images he‚Äôs drawn to and loves are simply beautiful. I even love his music taste. He‚Äôs made me want to listen to more undiscovered and alternative stuff. I‚Äôm slowly working on it, and I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve taken the efforts to build my music reservoir and taste.
Thirdly, he‚Äôs the only person in my life who praises me for my creations and just me being me. No one else does that like he does. He genuinely cares about me and my well-being, more than any person has that wasn‚Äôt my mom. He cares about my future, and the fact that I‚Äôm food enough for him just being me, makes me so happy.
Not to mention how funny he is, and how serious he can be. I love that he loves his classes, and I love the fact he supports and sponsors so many clubs. I love the fact he sponsors a mental health club, even if the few times I go I feel like a total loser and outsider. But it‚Äôs just that classroom... something about it makes me feel so safe. I never want to leave it. If I could live, work, eat, and sleep in there I would.

I think that‚Äôs why he impacts my life so much. He‚Äôs a great role model and mentor and no one can tell me otherwise. I know I get stalkerish and creepy talking about it, I completely realize that. But it‚Äôs hard not to obsess over someone who you respect to greatly that actually cares about you.

This weeks been a blur and had its highs and lows like usual. I‚Äôm glad I started journaling, even if I‚Äôm posting it to fucking reddit of all places. I wonder if people actually read all this shit I write. I don‚Äôt do it for others to read, or even myself. I just need to write to solve this shit show of emotions that is my head.

I need to either make a zine about water, and finish etching my plate tomorrow, or do my homework and study for finals. The battle between F and the potential of me getting an F. Hah.

Anyways, I wonder if future me reads these at all, or if my account ends up deleted and these entries erased from history. Either way I hope future me is doing okay and is happy with herself.

0,"day 3 - codependency revelation
I posted my morning thoughts in the breakups subreddit this morning - just questions I have but don't want answered.

Midday thoughts

Today I am doing much better. I have only cried once. I (again) cancelled by winery trip because didn't think I could make it 7+ hours talking about something not related to the breakup. I'm too focused on one thing right now. But since I ran out of coffee, I went to a coffee shop and had two cups and a burrito. Spotted a book I used to love as a child, and read through it and sent it to my dad. I can't believe people make money writing the simplest little books.

I went to the library but they didn't have the books I wanted, so I stopped by the bookstores and bought like $40 worth of books (two were christmas presents though). I'm really excited to start reading Co-dependence No More, the woman at the register told me it changed her life. Hopefully mine too. I also splurged and bought myself a new dress and two cardigans from a consignment shop. I have been disappointed in my wardrobe since I moved and cut it down by about 2/3. I wear the same clothes every week because I physically do not have more than that. I like to stay minimal but I also want to feel good about myself sometimes. I own about 6 shirts and that's not an exaggeration.

The rest of the day I'm just prepping for my flight tomorrow and reading my new books. Excited for some warm weather in AZ. I still need to work on my research, but...maybe next week.

Evening thoughts.

The ONLY book I wanted to check out from the library that was available was ‚ÄúCodependent No More.‚Äù I believed this meant that I was meant to read this book now and holy shit was I right. I am codependent. I‚Äôve been journaling and taking notes on the book in addition to this, but I‚Äôm realizing that growing up the way I did (torn apart home, alcoholics everywhere, autistic and violent brother, raising myself from a young age) that I became co-dependent. I thrive on destructive relationships, and when I‚Äôm not in crazy ones I create them. I am controlling, manipulative and it‚Äôs because I want better for people but it ends up poorly. I try to help so much and feel guilty when I don‚Äôt. I think that‚Äôs why my world revolves around volunteer working and dedicating my life. There‚Äôs a lot more to this in my other journals - but basically, I completely understand when I am codependent.

I controlled my ex to a point that annoyed me. I tried to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù him get a job, go to school, get good grades, etc. And when we started dating his grades improved and his dad actually thanked me. Then, it stopped working and I felt like I had lost him. He didn‚Äôt appreciate me or love me and it kept getting worse. I also wanted to volunteer so much I wasn‚Äôt willing to give him the time he needed. I wanted to live a missionary‚Äôs life and expect him to stay (not exactly missionary, but traveling a LOT for extended periods). and he had issues with this growing up because his father always traveled. wow am I stupid. I‚Äôve done this in past relationships too. It‚Äôs mad almost that it took me this long to realize. I am so grateful for this book and to the person on reddit who recommended it. can‚Äôt wait to keep reading and learning. this book has given me a lot of hope for a better future."

Well, it's Friday which means I am assuming you're probably hanging with you're new girl, which sucks. I'm at home watching Gilmore Girls which is actually incredible. This show gets me.

I had to send you money which is kinda like breaking NC but I felt bad that you paid me back for a trip and they refunded me. I hate it though - because either way it ends badly. You don't say anything or ask about the money, I feel shitty. You reach out, I feel shitty. maybe i should've just kept the money. fuck. I've been listening to comeback by Ella Eyre on repeat. I love this woman and this song - thank you for this gold mine.

I finally for to nap, which was incredible. I haven't been sleeping almost at all so passing out felt incredible. But of course, I woke up sad. I actually had a pretty depressing dream about you and your new girl. But hey - at least I slept.

I reignited my winery trip - but I'm the dd. I'm hoping they've got tea or something. It beats sitting at home doing research work. Although it's really important to get that stuff done like ASAP, I can't get myself to get started. I just have too many thoughts to process. I just finished my finals - I need a few days off for a little bit. I am not getting paid for research at the moment, so they can wait. You've gotta focus on yourself somethings.

my dad sent me some christmas gifts a little early, and I caved to open them. I needed something to rise my spirits. He sent me a salt lamp and an essential oil diffuser which are some things that I needed right now to calm down. I'm glad I didn't wait.

although I feel a little bit better, and I'm crying less I feel like I can't be motivated to anything but watch TV or play Tetris. Which maybe comes with finishing finals, but I am afraid that I am just moping around and letting myself feel isolated. as much as I don't really want to go and do things, I need to get out of the house tomorrow. I need to get out of the house.

we'll see if I can actually sleep tonight. didn't eat dinner. don't think I can get myself to do it."

Bit of anxiety here and there today but not bad. I worked a lot of course and feel tired at the moment. About to get ready for bed because I have to work in the morning. I took a quiz tonight and worked a liiiiitle bit on some ideas for my video project. I hope to finish that up tomorrow along with my timeline project that I need to do. I think the second one will just take a bit of time to actually sit down and do but it shouldn't be hard I don't think. If I can just get those things out of the way I would mostly just have exams left to worry about. I need to get ready for bed and sleep though so I am going to do that after this. I can worry about school tomorrow once I get out of class. That's all for now."

I cut my bangs this morning. They needed a good trim.

I still can‚Äôt remember the dream I had last night. I remembered fragments for the seconds after I woke up and they were gone as quick as they came.

I bought my water bottle and sat down in the same spot of the cafeteria I always do in the morning. I made myself tear up once and I just looked kind of miserable and bored.. at least I think I did.

I tried everything not to make eye contact with F. It‚Äôs bad enough I sit on purpose in a spot directly in his eyesight, but the last thing I need is eye contact. But we did. Brief and maybe he didn‚Äôt notice. I sat there for a whole minute awkwardly staring at the wall until I decided to pull out my phone to not look so weird.

I had a groupme notification from F. That must‚Äôve been why he looked up at me like that earlier. I wasn‚Äôt sure to reply right there, that seemed like the most awkward thing to do. I took three or four minutes to reply to his message about not being able to switch hours next semester. By the time I responded I was already leaving the cafeteria to go to class. We sent a few short messages back and forth figuring out what hour I could do. Then out of the blue he sent me a really long one that really touched my heart. He asked if I had reached out to the local art college representative and that I should, and that I have a 99.999999% chance of getting into the school. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed with joy whenever I read it or think about the fact that he cares so much about me.

I replied and he replied back. It was great. So much for looking depressed, but how could I when I have someone I respect and admire so much looking out for me.

Aced my math test, the day started out pretty good! Even in third hour Mrs. A sat next to me and we briefly chatted. We had snacks in 3rd AND 4th hr. And even 5th hour was good too. But all this happiness and upbeat spirits left me feeling guilty. I felt guilty for being happy and enjoying life. I don‚Äôt know why‚Äî still don‚Äôt. But I did.

I went down to lunch and got in line just in time. I only bought water because I was too full from snacks in my other classes. I thought at most maybe I‚Äôd see F and give an awkward smile, but someone tapped my shoulder and I turned to look but it was F and he tapped my shoulder on the other side to make me look. Old joke but it made me laugh. I said something dumb like ‚Äúhaha, I was like whaaa?‚Äù Ugh, but it wasn‚Äôt horrible.

I didn‚Äôt sit with my lunch table. I feel like an outsider, even with S and G there. I don‚Äôt do drugs, I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt have sex, I‚Äôm pretty fucking boring compared to the others there but they‚Äôre nice and tolerate me. I‚Äôm really grateful for them actually.

I sat out in the hallway with Aug and Log and Jean and Zach etc. They were so nice to me I wanted to cry tears of joy. They are such supportive friends and I just got overwhelmed with the good vibes coming from everyone. I love them so much.

I didn‚Äôt do much in portfolio, I got my research done and after giving up on sitting there silently eating my almonds all class Log and I started talking about the weird ass dreams we‚Äôve had. F saw my bag of almonds and said ‚ÄúAw Nuts‚Äù before my stupid brain processed the joke he was already talking to someone on the other side of the room. Yay.

I told Log about the weird dreams I‚Äôve had this week, even the one where I dreamt I saw F in a Wendy‚Äôs and my dad and him fought about cults. Log said I should tell F because it was funny but I freaked out and was like no no no no nooo no no. He didn‚Äôt understand why, but the emotional impact that dream had on me still makes me shiver. I left class without even saying bye to F or anyone. I thought about forsythia and how much that bush meant to Mom and I.

I talked a little more than I should have in 7th hr. It wasn‚Äôt devastating but it was foolish of me.

I lied to dad about why I was staying after school and I went to MYM. It was weird. I got there fashionably late. The only person I knew was Log, and even he was tuned out the entire time. So many Seniors I barely knew. They all seemed so happy, it made me so jealous. Even Glenn was there which was awkward considering he‚Äôs in my 7th hour and we kind of talked.. ish. They did question of the day and by the time it got to me I left the room pretending to take a call or something and I came back after they had passed where I sat. No one knew. I hope. I should have answered but Glenn was there and I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable.

We all made positivity paper snowflakes or some silly crap like that. Alex tried taught everyone how to fold it, except my mostly empty table. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how she folded it and I got really mad at myself and tried not to cry just because of all the overwhelming feelings I‚Äôd been having. I thought I folded it right and cut it out and when I unfolded it, it looked like two sad pizzas. I crumpled them up and just sat there watching people.

F walked by our table finally and asked what happened to my snowflake jokingly. I said I didn‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not very good at it. He said that this way was complicated and he never did it that way as a kid. I cut up paper and fiddled with shit in front of me to not look so creepy and sad just sitting there staring at people.

I‚Äôm worried that my weird attitude when I he talks to me and I talk back is scaring him off from being so friendly with me. I think he knows something is off, but I don‚Äôt think he thinks twice about it yet. I‚Äôm making progress but it‚Äôs never enough.

When everyone stared to leave I left right after them not wanting to just sit there. I can‚Äôt remember if he said bye or not. I don‚Äôt think so.
I went outside and sat in the cold freezing my butt off hoping F would drive by like he always did but he was late today and dad picked me up before F would drive by. I told myself when sitting on the steps that if F drove by before dad picked me up and I gave him a sad half smile with my red puffy eyes then I wouldn‚Äôt cut myself when I got home, and if my dad got here before F... well then I‚Äôd carve up my leg like a turkey.

And I did, my dad got there first... I got home took the super sharp new blade from my pencil sharpener and cut my leg 50 times before I had to stop and get ready for work. After doing all that I really started to realize that I have a serious mental issue, and that if this shit I‚Äôm doing continues then I could end up doing irreversible damage to my body and my head. I keep having suicidal thoughts and though I‚Äôd never ever do it, or attempt it, it really concerns me that I‚Äôm thinking about it so often.

Work was fine, but in the last 30 mins, I went to the bathroom to check up on my leg only to find that the cuts had opened back up and had bled all over the inside of my work pants. I tried to make a bandage out of toilet paper but it didn‚Äôt work. I decided to tough it out and pray it stopped bleeding so I could finish the last 30 minutes of my shift.

Grandma picked me up because the fam was at the church concert. I turned on the bath faucet to clean my leg properly and put on some comfortable clothes. I made dinner, way too much, and now I‚Äôm full, sitting on my bed trying to procrastinate the homework I have that‚Äôs due at midnight. I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôll do it or not.

I feel so sick with myself. How I‚Äôm able to have so many extreme highs and lows in just hours. This is so draining.

I hope I can etch my plate nicely before the end of the weekend. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll do bad."

feeling empty and isolated. i don‚Äôt even remember taking my final this morning. i don‚Äôt care anymore.

i ate a fairly normal breakfast and lunch but i feel shitty about it. forget my stuff to work on on campus so i had to bike home in the cold. i‚Äôm numb figuratively and literally. there‚Äôs no coffee left in my house. i think that‚Äôs the worst part rn.

i think it took my about three months to realize completely that i‚Äôd made a mistake. not sure if i can last that long again waiting for you. i will never be able to let go the idea of you being with someone else. it hurts too much. at least my cat knows i‚Äôm alive."
0,"day 2 - morning thoughts (I have too many)
Morning thoughts.

Last night was rough. Everything seemed to be going well until I shut off the lights to try to get some sleep. I immediately just began picturing my ex-boyfriend with his new girl. I had a panic attack, smoked like 8 cigarettes, and fought the urge to get on my bike and drive into a semi. I slept a solid 20 minutes it feels like. I kept waking up and thinking of him.

It‚Äôs almost amazing how quickly my thoughts turn to him in the morning. It‚Äôs like hey - you‚Äôre up. Remember all this shitty stuff that happened to you? I hope you remember this all day and have a shitty life.

I just can‚Äôt get the thoughts of them out my head. It repulses me so much I actually get nausea. That was supposed to be me. We were supposed to be together forever. We had plans to get married and have children. We were attached at the fucking hip. We told each other everything, all our deepest, intimate secrets for the past 4.5 years. And you threw it away in a fucking instant over a FaceTime call.

Being in what was formerly a long distance relationship it‚Äôs a blessing and curse to not be in the same area. A curse because I feel like we had no real closure. We never talked in person about any of this. A blessing because I‚Äôm not at risk of seeing him or going over to his house.

I‚Äôm just trying to keep my head up. My last final is in 3 hours and since I woke up at 5am after sleeping for almost no time, I am going to try and look over my notes. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to focus. I need to calm down before I do anything. I don‚Äôt know if I even want to go take this exam. What‚Äôs the point?

No - I need to keep going. I can‚Äôt give up. I'm stronger than this. Keep fighting and I promise it will be better. You can live you‚Äôre life in sadness, regret, and misery or you can go through the hard work now and live contently. You did it once with your eating disorder, and even though you‚Äôve lived with depression for 11 years you can climb out of this hole. You didn‚Äôt initiate it - but you kept digging, but there‚Äôs a way out.

I am thinking about taking off on my family‚Äôs christmas in the evening to go see a singer at a bar. I‚Äôve been listening to her album on repeat pretty much since the breakup and it‚Äôs one of the things that has been keeping me sane. I think it would be really good for me to get out and go see her (In Loving Memory of When I Gave a Shit - LOLO is the album). I am just looking for something to keep me going. I feel like all of my coping is revolved around journaling like 20 times a day and doing technical things like coding. I wish I could focus on something mind numbing. Actually, I can - Tetris but I get so addicted to that game it‚Äôs scary. You can only play it so long before all you see are Tetris pieces. I like to play word games because at least they make you think. But I‚Äôll be damned if I end up sitting around playing computer games for the rest of my life to avoid my problems. I need to find some other things to do.

I think I‚Äôll take up knitting again. Knitting is incredibly relaxing. The problem is you need something to focus on in addition to knitting and sometimes that has to be your thoughts. Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing? It always helped me share more with my therapist - I think maybe because I didn‚Äôt have to look at them. I should remember this for my future relationships - always knit during difficult discussions haha. See - learning already?

Later I‚Äôve got some research stuff to do for my thesis. I‚Äôm not really looking forward to it. I was, but I always want to sit around and mope. My problem is my lab space is desolate so I‚Äôm locked in this shitty room alone. It seems like it‚Äôs going to be depressing and I‚Äôll just end up crying all day. Maybe I can find somewhere else to work - somewhere where there are more people around. I‚Äôm sure all the other grad students are taking off since it‚Äôs the last day of the term. Just wish I knew of someone who could keep an eye out on me. I do have two desks I guess I could go to the other one but I hate that one. It‚Äôs probably even more depressing than the desolate room. There‚Äôs too many sad grad students in there - but there‚Äôs always good food.

Speaking of, I ate dinner last night but felt like absolute shit about it. I woke up again dehydrated and hungry but I just don‚Äôt have the desire to eat. I know there‚Äôs some of my ED talking but I think a lot of it is just being depressed and losing my appetite. I wish I could eat before this exam and day ahead of me, but I don‚Äôt see that happening. I only have one apple left and it‚Äôs very small - I don‚Äôt want to buy food since I am going out of town for two weeks starting this weekend. My god, I can‚Äôt wait. I want to make plans to see some old friends. But they all drink and lot and many do drugs (I wasn‚Äôt an angel when I was younger - go figure) and it‚Äôs hard to be around that when you‚Äôre trying to stay sober. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic or drug addict but when I do things and I‚Äôm depressed they don‚Äôt end well. I‚Äôm just trying to avoid it altogether. My one good old friend is my high school sweetheart. We actually dated for 4 years, and so the breakup was similar. I attempted suicide shortly after but not this time. We‚Äôre on good terms now, so at least there‚Äôs some hope. We were hanging out my freshman year and he started to ask about what we were doing and I rejected him because I was so thrown off and scared. And now I think he‚Äôs afraid to hang out with me. Whenever I ask, he just straight up ignores it somethings. Always cancels. He‚Äôs socially awkward I understand but I kinda just gave up trying. I would like to see him because he keeps me sane and he‚Äôs a great person to talk to. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs going to happen. Maybe if I‚Äôm honest and tell him I could really use a friend right now.

My god apparently I have a lot of thoughts in the morning. I just want to write forever about everything. I want to write about how I am so pissed off that you‚Äôre seeing another woman. Jesus fuck, It‚Äôs so hard to deal with. I can‚Äôt believe I put you threw this and didn‚Äôt fucking realize it. If you say that you regret coming back to me after all this shit went down, then that‚Äôs good to know. Because maybe then I know not to go back to you if you ever want me to. It‚Äôs sad but I know I would go back to you. That‚Äôs why I want to keep up this NC (2.5 days now) so I can get over this. I originally had plans to message on Christmas just to say Merry Christmas but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea. I just need to let it go. Move on. Be content with ripping of the bandaid. Even though it felt like you were, you weren‚Äôt meant to be together.

The bad things.

I‚Äôm gonna write some of the things I didn‚Äôt like about the relationship to remind myself why I should be grateful for this breakup. 1) You were never in a good mood. Ever. Always cranky and negative. Even my roommate said you were cranky.

2) You never talked about yourself. You got angry with me that I didn‚Äôt listen, but you never had anything to say. I ask you about your day and you gave me nothing. I ask you about soccer and you give me nothing. Like just because I don‚Äôt understand soccer doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to listen to you talk about it for hours - I like listening to people talk about what they‚Äôre passionate about.

3) you weren‚Äôt passionate about anything *except* soccer. So I didn‚Äôt get to hear you talk, rant or vent about much of anything. You seemed to have no goals, aspirations or desires.

4) You didn‚Äôt have a real job. Actually, I don‚Äôt mind not having a real job. Bartending is a good job...if you love it. You complain about needing something more? Then go and fucking get it dude. No one is stopping you. Stop feeling sorry for yourself about you life choices and make a change.

5) We were both very depressed, suicidal, and lacked self-confidence. It‚Äôs difficult enough when one person is struggling, but to have two that can‚Äôt talk about their feelings is just fucked.

6) you rely on your parents for everything. I know they still send you money. You‚Äôre 24 - come on man. I haven‚Äôt taken a dime from my parents other than gifts since high school and even IN HIGH SCHOOL was giving money to my mom. Time to be a big boy.

7) we didn‚Äôt know how to have dates other than eating out. We never really did anything interesting together. We loved to lay in bed and go to restaurants, coffee shops, and sometimes even wine bars, but other than that we did nothing. No picnics, walks, anything. We could never agree and always just gave up.

8) you‚Äôre fucking addicted to your cell phone. Literally you would go to visit my mom with me and be on your phone the whole time. When I call you out, my mom sides with you? I think it‚Äôs just rude. You always had your phone on dates and couldn‚Äôt control yourself and actually made me take it away from you sometimes. And you‚Äôre just looking at shitty memes and twitter feeds. Like really - memes make you happier than me?

9) we had a shitty sex life. I really faded because I was in a lot of pain, but I feel like you tried way too hard and it was off-putting. It almost creeped me out. I was uncomfortable.

10) when we lived together, you didn‚Äôt chip in for food. I get it - your parents paid the rent (which was fucking shitty on me) but *you* personally did not have expenses. I would be absolutely fine paying for everything if you had offered to help. You never offered, you literally would ask me at the store if you could buy things. It‚Äôs like dude I‚Äôm not you‚Äôre fucking mother. Buy your own shit.

11) you complained about the things that were most important to me. I should have prioritized more, but I don‚Äôt really think you understand how important it is for me to be involved in the volunteer work I do. It keeps me sane, it helps me cope, and it gives me meaning. It is my purpose and I can‚Äôt not pursue it. I‚Äôm sorry that it requires me to travel, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to be gone all the time. It‚Äôs a compromise, but I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd like to compromise in the favor of me having meaning in my life. i was willing to compromise to - it wasn‚Äôt going to be longer than a month or so at a time of travel.

12) you never make up your mind. Just like the job thing, you can‚Äôt decide what you want. Where do you want to live? What should you do? Should you go back to school? Like I can‚Äôt actually believe you had the guts to tell me that it was *my* fault you couldn‚Äôt see a real future. You‚Äôre talking about MOVING to a country where I don‚Äôt speak the language and women aren‚Äôt exactly the most respected as engineers. I just wanted to travel for a few weeks at a time.

13) you get fixated on small issues. This mentally-ill person used to live next door to us and play the saxophone terribly. Yes, it was annoying. But some headphones in and shut up. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I heard him complain about that guy.

14) your money habits. It seemed like you were starting to improve, but I‚Äôm not positive. You went over $5,000 into credit card debt to buy yourself a computer to play games on. I have absolutely no problem at all with you buying a computer, in fact I think it‚Äôs a good thing when you have the fucking money. You spent and spent and like 70% of it is just on food. You continued to do things like (you probably still have) a gym membership you never use. like dude?? have some self-control. You‚Äôre parents still give you money and yet you still overspend on shit.

15) you changed your mind about kids. You‚Äôve always said you didn‚Äôt want them, and I thought we were on the same page that we never wanted biological children. I never want to give birth - just adopt. You agreed. then randomly one day you say you may want to have biological children? Like that‚Äôs kinda a big deal, dude.

16) when i finally did start really hanging out with people, you shit talk them. You shit talk my friends and accuse me of shit or make snarky comments. You friends pressured you to snort cocaine and mine are the problem?

17)  you never wanted to run with me, I get it - we‚Äôre not all runners, but i just wish it was something we could‚Äôve done together. The times we did go it was great but you always had an excuse.

18) \^\^ you always have an excuse.

19) you‚Äôre a hypocrite. you shit on my for being busy all the time and when you get busy (still not even as committed as I was, dude?!) you complain about your life and stop doing things with me, you didn‚Äôt prioritize me. you‚Äôre no different dude, face it.

20) your gifts always made me feel like you didn‚Äôt understand me. It would‚Äôve meant more to me for you not to give me a gift because you would‚Äôve understood minimalism. You literally just tried to show you could spend money. Over and over again.

21) I always knew you had a thing for one of our friends, but she‚Äôs in a committed relationship. I knew when you were crushing on people - you would flirt with them in front of me. Maybe you two ran off together. who cares at this point? good riddance.

That‚Äôs enough - I needed that. Especially kids and money. That shit it very important in life.

I also had a thought. I hope this new girl is a coworker - that shit always ends weird/bad.

I got over a lot of my anxiety by and large that I felt earlier in the day. Feeling ok now. School was shitty today. I got a lot of points off on my exam I got back today for a dumb reason, I don't even think what I put is wrong but I know the prof is super anal about this kind of stuff so I don't know if I will even bring it up. I also wrote a really harsh review for one of my profs today and I know they will know its me from the hand writing but I don't really care. I have a ton of different things to do this weekend for school and I just want to do none of it. I am also thinking of trying to find a job at my college and want to quit my job with kids because I am tired of the company. Alright, that's all for now. "

I woke up today again with another quite awful dream. I wrote it down in my notes app. The panic and exhaustion was too intense to capture at 7 when I finally got up to write it down before the dream faded. I still don‚Äôt know what it means...

‚ÄúAll of us were in this strange house on vacation I kept screaming dad dad dad dad over and over to get him to leave this maze of a building/house we were in. He didn‚Äôt respond, suddenly when I caught up to him he clutched his chest like it hurt really bad.
This random homeless dude passed us on the stairs. I awkwardly nodded and I should have given him the socks I was holding.
He jumped in front of us and like started changing clothes at his locker. I looked away. Then he went back to wear the garage door openers were. He closed one, I was able to roll through the bottom one before it closed completely and I got my fingers under the next one before he could trap me in there. I ran and hid in the front seat of our car in the driveway. I overheard them say to leave me out there, that the pain of knowing my family was suffering inside was enough.

Then I woke up‚Äù

I checked my phone. August posted something puzzling on his story about ‚Äústumbling over his words when talking about drawing cows with someone he kinda liked that he‚Äôd been excited for all day.‚Äù I reread all he had wrote 2-3 times. I have no idea who he could be talking about. I‚Äôm probably reading into it too much. He‚Äôs gay anyways, and I‚Äôm... me.

The art college I plan on attending‚Äôs continuing education Instagram page followed me. THEY FOLLOWED ME. Completely without warning or reason. I texted Milla and they already followed her and we shared this brief moment of extreme excitement.

I barely made it to school on time, had to run to Algebra. I worked with Sydney for the entire period. We talked about our Spotify Wrapped in the halls on the way to seminar. She‚Äôs so nice, and I don‚Äôt understand why she tolerates me, and even enjoys talking to me‚Äî we don‚Äôt have anything in common besides our names.

I listened to episode 107 of HBM in seminar and went to lunch afterwards. I ate my shitty pizza and left to sit in the hall outside of the painting room. I listened to music and was quite at peace being alone.

English passed, and then came art portfolio. I decided I wanted to let out this shit that‚Äôs been bothering me for so long but I can‚Äôt get myself not to smile when F, or any of my friends at my table are around. I kept rubbing my eyes making them puffy and red and pinched my nose and cheeks to look tired and distressed. No one said anything. Almost 40 minutes passed of me doing absolutely nothing at all, watching Logan draw as I usually do, and staring off into space, or at F just longing for him to see my eyes that were struggling to water up. I‚Äôm so fucking desperate and it‚Äôs disgusting and sad and makes me sick to write this down.

His marigold linoleum prints were set up at the place I sat. It was kind of in the way but I didn‚Äôt mind, I wasn‚Äôt doing anything anyways. Eventually F came over to work on finishing printing his block cut of a flower for his daughter. They were so good, the thought and time went into carving it is amazing. He loves his kids so much.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I wanted to shrink, I felt so large and yet so small with him standing right there. After a couple minutes of awkward conversation about future art club proceedings, I got up and left to the bathroom when someone else started talking to him. I banged my head on the wall a few times and came back to class quickly. I don‚Äôt remember much of exactly what he said mostly because I was so so so awkward and quiet and on the verge of tears and after a brief silence he casually said, ‚ÄúSo what have you made today ‚Äî‚Äî-?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt lie, I said nothing. It was such an odd question but so profound. I hadn‚Äôt made anything today, or yesterday, or the day before. I felt ashamed and embarrassed and like a failure, especially to him.

He asked about my copper plate that he‚Äôd gone to all the trouble to cut for me. I had posted on my story yesterday about it mocking me from the across the room. The plate is too perfect and my drawing skills are so clumsy. I told him the truth on why I hadn‚Äôt done anything to it yet.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. My phone was almost dead, I didn‚Äôt want to leave, I just wanted to sit there forever at that table with my friends and him just talking and making art forever and class came to an end and I left and went to FRLNCR.

It was awkward once again. I was already depressed and still on the verge of tears for not being able to show my pain great enough to F. God it sounds so stupid to say that. I don‚Äôt like FRLNCR, I really only went in hopes that I could talk to Lilah or Milla. It was awful again. I critiqued another one of Angela‚Äôs endlessly numerous pieces of mediocre art. It was awful I felt like such a snob. I left at 3:30 to go sit on the stairs outside and maybe F would wave to me when he left to go pick up his son. When I got down to the art hall. He had just locked his door and was walking out to go to his car and he said hi real quick and asked why I was still hanging around, but he kind of answered himself by asking if I was just waiting for my dad. I said yeah and bye and I ran to go sit on the stairs.

He drove by not soon after and waved to me. I tried my very fucking best to show my pain without overtly crying or being too happy and waving back. I gave him the fucking depressed smile I give and I think he might have looked concerned for the first time in a while. I hope so, and that I just didn‚Äôt read his face wrong.

It was too cold so I ran to the front of the building and talked to Athena while I waited for dad to pick me up. I got home and after a little while pulled down my leggings and sliced up my legs quite a bit. I didn‚Äôt feel direct anger or sadness like I had earlier. Things were just kind of numb. By the time they had stopped bleeding and it was safe to put my pants over them I ate dinner and we left for the church Christmas concert.

It was fine. The man at my table asked me what I wanted to do in college. I don‚Äôt know why I froze up and said my dumbass ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I honestly don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt honest. Am I subconsciously scared of what people at church will think about art school? Ugh.

Now It‚Äôs already 9:30 and I haven‚Äôt started on my AP research at all. I still hate this project with a passion. On top of that my outside reading is due for English tomorrow at midnight. I‚Äôll figure this all out somehow. I hope.

I need a miracle. God help me and my fucked up head.

Edit: after posting this I had a good cry while scrolling through moms old facebook.
I miss her so much it hurts so bad I want to hug her and play another game of Chinese checkers or keep her company while we wait for dinner to cook or walk with her around the trail at the park. I want to dance in the rain with her and sit alone on her porch watching the sunset. I want more visits to the book store or to any store. I miss or adventures and or heartfelt conversations. I miss her so much, every ounce of me hurts. It‚Äôs not fair I never got to say goodbye. I had no warning. I‚Äôm sorry mom. "

Morning thoughts.

Today I woke up and for two seconds was really happy in moving forward in recovery. Then I remembered my boyfriend left me and probably spent the night with another woman.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night and I cancelled my group study session for my final tomorrow (whoops I should probably study at some point). I also called off a trip to a winery because I don‚Äôt think I should be drinking in my state. I didn‚Äôt eat anything yesterday and the day before I only had an apple. I told myself I would start clean at breakfast tomorrow, but I made toast and can‚Äôt seem to eat it.

I think the biggest issue with not being able to eat is that I‚Äôm not allowing myself to run because of it. Running is a really big coping mechanism for my anxiety and depression, but obviously not for my eating disorder. So I can‚Äôt run unless I eat. But I often can‚Äôt eat until I run. It‚Äôs a cycle. But I am incredibly dehydrated this morning and shouldn‚Äôt run. In fact, I probably shouldn‚Äôt go to my study session because I would have to bike anyway.

I know I should actually study for this final, but I have literally 100% in that class. I am a perfectionist to the point where it is very unhealthy in terms of grades. I turned in a take home exam yesterday that wasn‚Äôt my best work on purpose. I can‚Äôt keep killing myself over the details. I need to *learn* what I can and accept the grades I get. I know that I am intelligent and what really matters is that I can use what I am learning. When I was recovery from my eating disorder the first time, I intentionally would do worse on homework and exams and allowed myself to get B‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt study for the ACT at all and still managed to get accepted to college and an engineering degree. So suck on that perfectionist America and the pressure we put our children under. I felt way better for it. So I‚Äôve decided to not kill myself over this exam, and let my actual priorities take precedence (my priorities are my health, and my relationship with my family/cat obviously).

Tomorrow I have plans to keep myself busy with some research for my thesis. It‚Äôs not every technical work, just organizing and I love that. May look into some data but nothing overly strenuous. I think I should ask a friend to get coffee in the evening. Saturday I am thinking of taking advantage of the predicted sunny 51-degree weather and take this hike I have been wanting to do forever - just gotta eat to be able to do it. I might invite my brother and maybe we can get breakfast together so it makes eating easier. I‚Äôm going to go to the library and check out a few books that have been on my list forever and keep myself occupied reading. I need to make a plan before my flight on Sunday to visit my grandma on Sunday or I‚Äôll be in a terrible state. My first live therapy session is Monday, and I am also learning how to dance country-western with my grandma and her partner is going to take us to show off a country bar...literally what did I get myself into haha.

Midday Thoughts.

The good thing about the past is that it is just that - the past. It doesn‚Äôt need to be the future.

It sat in the toaster for about an hour but I did eat my toast. I also made a list of things to keep me occupied and I‚Äôm really excited. I‚Äôve been wanting to put together some code to simplify a few calculations and analyses so I‚Äôm going to get started working on those. I also have a ton of things I have been wanting to do to support a nonprofit I‚Äôm involved in so I‚Äôm going to collect some data and do some volunteer work. I am also thinking of completing some online courses just to keep my mind occupied. I am prepping to potentially speak a conference about some undergraduate research I did that is very controversial. I‚Äôm putting together that presentation and the abstract to submit and hopefully I‚Äôll be able to share a much needed perspective.

I told my mom about restarting therapy and I am grateful she is supportive. She‚Äôs known way longer than I have that I need to get back on this path. Mom‚Äôs are very wise.

Evening Thoughts.

Cigarettes and dehydration is not a good mix. I had more toast and even ordered some takeout because there‚Äôs nothing in my house since I am leaving this weekend for almost two weeks. I didn‚Äôt eat much of it though. I actually studied a little and my brain was super focused and it was pretty easy to problem-solve.

Some times it gets easier - I think the nights are generally easier. I get random spurts of thinking about my boyfriend with someone else and feel sick. I find comfort in pretending he is also sad AF and that he wants to talk to me even though it‚Äôs probably not true. I can‚Äôt accept that yet but hopefully in a little while.

0,"Ups, and infinite downs
I can't remember the last time I woke up and just looked at the sunlight streaming into my room, and felt happy in my heart.

&#x200B;

The last time I felt butterflies. Or just lay in bed thinking how lucky I am and how happy I am.

&#x200B;

I'm so sick of being fucked over and ignored by people I put trust into.

&#x200B;

I can't stand the thought that a guy loved me once more than anything and when I grew to love him too, he broke up with me after two years. It's fucking twisted. It's fucking twisted to be lured in like that and to realize what is in front of your eyes only to have it taken away. After almost the first year of our relationship blossomed a long distance relationship that made me feel like my future had a direction, him. It would all be okay, I could crawl into his lap someday soon and rest against him. I could slip the ring he gave me onto my finger and tie the knot. Have two beautiful kids. A traditional family. A life I never knew I wanted. He brought out so much good in me.

&#x200B;

2018 has felt like a parallel universe. I want my old life back. I want him back. I want to stop carrying around so much negativity and baggage for fucking once in the past months. It's getting exhausting. I want it to fucking end. I hate having emotions these days. They're bothersome and complicate everything.

&#x200B;

It's my stupid naivity and emotions that let somebody get so close to me and have a firm grasp on my heart. And for what? To wake up one day and be broken up with. Like that. Nothing else. No warning. No signs.

&#x200B;

I don't know how good of a person I am. I don't know what I should have in life. I don't think I deserve much at all, to be honest. I'm not a good person.

&#x200B;

But this? Wouldn't wish this on someone I despised. Nobody deserves to go to bed everynight and wake up feeling monumental worthlessness and loneliness. Friends are fine, but you know damn well there's a gap only that one person can fill, and beyond that you have to walk around with this gaping hole where they should be.

&#x200B;

Shame on me for thinking this would work. There's so much pain these days I'd almost honestly want to go so far as to say fuck you, fuck what you did to me, fuck your emotions, and fuck our relationship. It was better to be single and completely loveless than to put up with this much pain in day to day life. I don't know about this payoff. Being happy for what is ultimately a few months in my whole lifespan thinking my life would work out and we could work out was great, but for the endless torment I'm going to have to deal with I should've just fucking never met you.

Alright, time to do another post real quick. This is for yesterday! I had quite the rough day with bad thoughts and stuff. I also made some rough choices and felt a lot of anxiety about it this morning because I had a weird dream where I was texing some other girl but keeping it a secret from Her. But I feel like I need to stay calm and learn to let things pass and not berate myself over it. I am still doing well in the grand scheme of things I feel. I am really tired right now. Also, I did no hw yesterday which is bad. I did a little bit this morning so that's good. I emailed my supervisor yesterday and then She later sent an email to the whole companing basically adressing my email."

I woke up wanting to die. And I woke up with a strange and emotionally horrifying and draining dream. I wrote it down in the notes app this morning:


‚ÄúWe went to Wendy‚Äôs for dinner like we do on Wednesday but we keep seeing F every time we go out to dinner. I think my dad hates F. I was worried, like he didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge I was there. I felt like a stalker, but this time it wasn‚Äôt my own doing, it was complete chance we‚Äôd seen each other at the same restaurant every Wednesday for the last three weeks. For some reason we were sitting at the same table. I don‚Äôt know why. Then my dad suddenly goes. ‚ÄúSo, how do you like living in a cult of art‚Äù (something like that)
And F responds quite rudely, ‚ÄúHow do YOU like being in a cult?‚Äù
I was freaking out. August was there for some reason, I went over to him by the drink machine and told him what happened.

I can‚Äôt believe my head invents this crap. I can‚Äôt believe my subconscious would make my view of someone I care about nasty and disgusting like that. Jesus.‚Äù


After analyzing it I totally get where it got it‚Äôs cult roots from and why August was there. But what really worried me is the blatant rudeness of F. Ugh. But I need to remember it‚Äôs just a dream and F would never do anything like that because he is a pure and wholesome and perfect person.

I got to school and sat in my normal spot and was actually able to make myself cry because I miss being able to hug mom. I don‚Äôt know if F saw me from that far across the room or not, but either way I didn‚Äôt care.

We watched half of the Great Gatsby in US History this morning. I went to seminar and talked with Brooklyn. It was so hard hiding my arm from her, I really shouldn‚Äôt wear short sleeves when my scars are still red. Especially around her when she kind of noticed them the previous week. I wish the big ones would just disappear.

I went down to lunch like usual and get in line at precisely the right time so that F comes into the cafeteria like I always do. Got my shitty chicken and potatoes and was punching in my student number when F was like ‚ÄúHey S, cool shoes‚Äù UGH. I really shouldn‚Äôt have worn my ugly ass shiny mirror shoes from last year. I hate people noticing me as if the 6ft, overweight, art kid who wears too much mismatching denim doesn‚Äôt already get enough attention. I want to shrink. I told F that I sarcastically hated my shoes and I shouldn‚Äôt have worn them at all in the first place. He said they were cool and laughed and left. Great, as if I couldn‚Äôt be more awkward.

I was walking over to the other side of the cafeteria to get ketchup like I always did, I followed not that far behind F. I was getting my ketchup when I said hi to Ava standing at the microwave we chatted a few words and I was about to leave and she straight up goes, ‚Äúwhat happened to your arm?‚Äù I panicked and almost immediately blurted out ‚Äúoh just the cats‚Äù just fucking that. And ran off back to my table. I wanted to die but I didn‚Äôt cry and I wasn‚Äôt too worried. I thought Mr. H was looking at me later but it was probably just paranoia.

Art Club was okay. Not good, not horrible either. As I predicted no one brought their carved blocks and I printed out my shitty emo af block of my hands over my face and they turned out bad. I think F was just still bummed about the field trip, which was by the way canceled for us tomorrow. I guess it‚Äôs a good thing but I was hoping I got F‚Äôs van again like last week. August is such a nice kid, we don‚Äôt have MUCH in common but I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs so genuinely nice to me and it‚Äôs really sweet of him. I feel so awkward and fat around everyone and especially him for some reason. Gonna go on another purge this week.

Nothing really planned for next weeks club but F mentioned something about doing art with local disabled children which sounds fun. Hopefully.

I got home, I‚Äôm kind of worried the car rides with dad and I are getting too awkward, I can‚Äôt let him see I‚Äôm depressed, especially if someday he finds out about the self harm, I don‚Äôt want him to actually realize I was sad. We got home and I talked to Alex C briefly and posted a bit on my story and then sliced up my leg a bit. I‚Äôm kind of mad that I didn‚Äôt cut as deep as yesterday but that was a shit show and scared me really bad. I guess it‚Äôs for the best that I don‚Äôt. But I want to.

Church was fine.

I guess in reflection that today was just kind of boring. I hate boring. I want days to be extremely happy or super sad or else I feel like I didn‚Äôt LIVE enough that day. I want to cry like I did a week or few weeks ago but I can‚Äôt bring myself to anymore, especially not around F which is so annoying because I want him to see I‚Äôm in pain but he just makes me so happy it‚Äôs hard to not smile.

Someday I‚Äôll get this shit that‚Äôs been bogging me down off my chest and I can finally work on making beautiful art and having good friendships..


Edit: oH yeah and Milla texted me and we decided we should hang out with River sometime. I haven‚Äôt hung out with anyone from school in 5 years, it‚Äôs been so long and I was so happy I wanted to cry. "

So guy I've been talking to says he needs to be alone for a bit. I'm all for giving space. But 2 things

1) I'm worried about him. Hope hes ok. I know hes been going through some rough stuff and hes against suicide. But still makes me worried.
2) it's the first day/night in over a month we haven't talked. And it feels so weird. Instantly feeling that crushing lonely feeling. I just got off the phone with my mom and we talked for over an hour but as soon as I hung up, the silence has just been overwhelming.

I've heard 100 times that I shouldn't depend on others for my happiness but making others happy is where I get my joy from. I find myself already wanting to  start looking back online just to have contact and I know and acknowledge that isn't right. But I just really hate being all by myself.

I'm losing this guy and I can't really help it. And the one reason hes disappearing is cause and effect. Shit confidence, he hates it, leaves, causes more shit confidence.

Idk what to do. Just going to go back to fake it till I make it.

I dont feel good either... and today WAS such a good day..."

Im so sorry if this isnt the best place for this question, but I didnt know where else to go. Everyone keeps telling me it could help a lot if i start a journal/diary of some sorts. After a very long stressful day ive got about 10 pages back and forth dated December 5th in the begining of a quite hefty 5 star notebook. My question is, what do i do with this notebook once its full? Do people keep their journals to reflect on possibly later in life? I just dont quite understand the point I guess."
0,"Garbage post. Just getting out my thoughts.
I'm constantly feeling like I'm not enough. And though I've been working on my confidence, and have made huge improvements, I'm about to lose (again) a great potential relationship because of my lack of confidence. Which brings my confidence down because I've been working on it but its still not enough. It's like a vicious snowball effect. And I know: if this guy really cared, I wouldnt feel this way. But he's been helping me and he makes me feel more relaxed and stress free than I've ever felt. And we hit it off so well and then suddenly it all crashed and burned. I dont know what to say to him or what to do. He had some thoughts about me not liking sex that I told him were very wrong so I'm wondering if maybe these thoughts of low confidence are wrong too. I love who I am. I am working on loving what I look like (both in acceptance and physical changes). So overall, I'm happy with me. I'm just bad at projecting that I guess. It's like everyone in my past has torn me down so now I'm left picking myself back up... why is confidence so important in a SO anyways? I dont look for 1 thing in particular because each person has qualities to balance themselves out. If one has low confidence but is an genuinely nice person; or if they get angry fast but calm down just as quickly... everything balances. Plus, some people have too much confidence and become cocky and arrogant and I hate that.

Idk. Just feel like I'm always going to be battling this because nobody wants to give me a chance..."

I put the wrong month in yesterday, I guess that says a lot about what I‚Äôm feeling now. November flew by and now finals are around the bend. I‚Äôm not prepared. I don‚Äôt want to do school work, I just want to daydream and stare out my window at night watching the cars go by. I want to listen to the sounds my house makes and listen to new music and learn all the words. I want to watch a good movie and cry and pick at the scabs from my healing cuts. I want to mourn my mom but I can‚Äôt find the tears, I‚Äôve picked over every memory to cry to.

God I sound so emo.

What happened to me? What happened to my faith? Have I lost it completely? Has my family noticed?

I don‚Äôt want to think about it so I push the thought of God and my faith out. It hurts too much to think about.

Today was so average. Too typical. I thought I‚Äôd be done with having anxiety about my grades before finals, but I gave up on my grades when I realized that my artistic abilities matter more than my GPA in the college I plan on attending.

F introduced or next project, ‚ÄúArt as social commentary‚Äù

Great. üôÑ

I want to work hard on this one but I‚Äôm not sure I have the time or drive to do so. I‚Äôll end up doing the bare minimum and leave a barely mediocre picture of myself in F‚Äôs mind. I‚Äôve begun to already expect less of myself when around him so I don‚Äôt end up crying and cutting myself every when I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve been my best self. I already can see a future vision of me nervously saying bye per usual and crying as soon as I leave the art room after my final leaving my winter break sour.

But maybe it will be good. I hope, I need a creative boost this Dec and Jan if I want to get a full/large scholarship to the PCAL.

...

Alex C posted a beautiful video on his insta, I commented and he DMed me and we caught up very briefly. It was so good to talk to him, we hadn‚Äôt talked since April before mom died and sent me down this rabbit hole to hell. He has so much talent and I‚Äôm so happy for him when I see him succeed! He is such a rarity in today‚Äôs teens, I don‚Äôt like him but I do, not romantically, but just as a friend and someone who genuinely cares about his wellbeing.

These emotional rollercoasters of days are starting to get to me. Going from cutting my thighs deeper than I have before to catching up with an old friend who made me filled with joy takes a toll on me. If I‚Äôm not feeling anything intense I feel worthless and numb.

I want things to change ever so slightly, maybe I‚Äôll pray, maybe I‚Äôll work on my Independent Project, maybe I‚Äôll listen to some Black Pistol Fire. But I am NOT doing my homework.

Who knows.

Looking forward to Art Club tomorrow ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"Starting over.
""You seem so happy and calm. What happened?""

&#x200B;

A breakup. Two years. Romance for the first time. The strongest feelings I've ever felt my entire life. The strongest I've ever known.

The deepest unconditional love. From both sides. A ring. An engagement?

All broken off, and for what?

I can't start over. I don't need to explain my erratic behavior to another person, another lover. I don't need to look into a new set of eyes and find trust, comfort, honesty. It won't happen. I want it to, but it won't.

I gave you everything I had, everything I was, and I thought I knew you and us, what we wanted, what you wanted.

I was wrong, and now I'm alone just like before, but worse. Paranoia. Anxiety. What's happening next?

The absence of the ring on my finger is one that slices deep into whatever I have left of a heart.

You don't need me anymore, and I'm starting not to need you, but it'll take some time. So go on, find a new lover. Treat her half as good as you treated me and you'll have yourself a wife.

Thanks for everything. Even if I feel like just jumping into a frozen river and staying there would be infinitely less painful than the hell I am currently in. Enjoy yourself.  We're young.

So to answer your question, I'm not calm. I'm not happy. I have to act that way. If I don't and I am my true self every time you try to interact with me now, you're going to fully be out of my life overnight. I wish terrible fucking things for you for a split second and then all I want is for you to find a nice girl.

I guess that's how breakups work. I thought I'd know by now.

I thought I mattered a bit. But I don't think I do anymore.

&#x200B;

I feel invalid. I feel wild. I feel emotional. Things that should never be happening are happening. I don't matter enough to one person to feel like I matter at all.

&#x200B;

When things happen I want to spill it to someone, that one person you can tell everything to because I need someone like that but even he has his own things to deal with. Even he probably won't understand. The people I have around me are nice, sure, but if I told them any of the emotions I have sometimes nobody would get it. I would get a pat on the shoulder. A ""there, there."" Nobody cares. Everyone is taking care of themselves. I need help. I want to be taken care of. I want to put my head on a chest at the end of the day and just sob.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of wet pillows.

&#x200B;

I just want to be cared for. I want to be told that as irrational as my feelings are, that they're ok. I don't have to feel bad, or guilty. It's okay. But nobody's here anymore. Nobody. I stick my neck out when I can and do what I can for people but nobody cares. I put others above myself as much as I can but nobody cares. I just want someone, something. I want peace.

i went to the gas station job to do my training and turns out they havent officially put me on the schedule. i wanted to wait for the store owner to arrive to talk to him so i just sat behind the count playing on my phone while customers come and go. i saw a few of the guys from the car wash job, including the manager. it felt awkward but i put on a fake niceness.  the manager acted like he was happy for me that i was working there but it was just a front. i waited 4 hours before the store owner finally showed up. i asked him when i can start training and he just looked at and asked the girl that works there who am i and how old i was. then he went in the office in the backroom and never came back out. that irritated me so i left. i stopped by my grocery job and asked the manager confirming my vacation days. when i talked to her she had a big attitude and was very rude. that hurt my feelings and ruined my day. she really changed on me. i thought she loved me. i guess not anymore. i really need to find another job. i keep getting fucked around by these no good managers. im off from work tomorrow so ill be at the library with my laptop. i wish there was a temp job that can pay me by the day instead of just working for the whole week. i could use the extra money. nothing is going good for me man..."

Field trip was canceled today, but I was able to finish my zine about bones in the time we would have been on the field trip. I‚Äôm not disappointed, I‚Äôve been before so it‚Äôs alright.

F read my zine in club today and liked it, although I‚Äôm pretty sure he liked ‚Äúhow to brainwash the feeble‚Äù more. It makes me kind of sad, but if I‚Äôll be honest with myself I like it more too. F shares stuff with me that is just so pure, like how he loves to pick up his son every day from school, or simple things like that.

But I feel this deficit in this relationship of a sort of mutual respect we have. I think he likes me more as a person now but I want my artistic skills to be as great as who I am. Sounds narcissistic, but I can‚Äôt really describe what I‚Äôm trying to say.

He gave me a copper plate to etch onto. I had high hopes, I‚Äôm sure he does too. This beautiful piece of copper awaiting a masterpiece. But yet again the skills I think I have are way higher than the ones I actually possess.

I want to make a beautiful print for my PCAL portfolio, but I keep struggling with drypoint etching, it‚Äôs not the same as a pen, the pen is perfect, but the payoff of a good print is indescribable.

I gave up now. I‚Äôll try tomorrow if I get a chance. All I want to do anymore is listen to rock and cut off the scabs on my thighs. I no longer feel the cuts, but I can feel scabs, which is good enough.

I just want the skills to draw what I see..

I miss mom too, but not enough. I push the thought out of my head the second it tries to enter. I maybe watered up once today. Not good enough, I just want to cry. Maybe I‚Äôm addicted to intense emotions, but I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore.

And must have been during...I remember there's a note on pizza, and for the time you got your watch returned by Dr howcaniforgethername...hm was it 2015... I will always sigh about a time machine, right. You remember that LPT 'you think about major changes in your life, but of you get a time machine to go back and change something , it would be only some minor change you should be doing and so blablabla ' . I don't want to spoil it but that minor thing isn't just some minor thing for which we would go back in time. Its the point of butterfly effect. I can identify two such points in my life ( pls dear if you are reading this later don't try to recall - the past is in the past) ..maybe 3points, but f-u-c-k-i-t.

Fuck it all.

Now to the moments that made you happy-

-Mato Jelic's intro

- gazele's sister's chatter which your brother is fond of . And her recalling it today , Dec 2018

- that guy's tight ass that made you come up with that pick up line. Dec 2018. India gate.

- Spy kids movie

- songs by the midnight

- the mess , you complemented the guy on Diwali food and he's been really nice. Nov 2018

- Laurid? On pubg . A kid that taught you a different way to play , and to see things. And his cute voice 'come,come'

- times spent at your friend. Aug 2018. Nice food. Movie. Pubg. Shopping. Fuck I forgot the most important thing....rides. her friends were cute too

- your another friend. Sept 2018. Spending time with her. Her nice apartment facing the farm. Your walk there and you feeling poopy. üòÄ

- your brother's friend. Talkative one talking stories, made you want to belong here

- mess, cute wife, cute, her son

-tibetan guys et all - feeling optimistic and hopeful

- that baby's smile-ing . Waiting on metro . Nov 2018.

- the kind old man....watch....Kesar..

-dummdaaa Vidya's, esp about the teetotaller boi

-while you were practicing handwriting. It brings back your mojo

- the biriyani. It was yummy üò≠ sept 2018

- you made yummy noodles 2018 summer

- tea with Dr Abhishek

Had a bit of anxiety today but not too much, bit of bad thoughts too. Feel like I had more positive and good thoughts about Her overall though. W hung out and watched tv all day which was fun. We also cleaned a bit and popped over to the store for a second. We watched 13 episodes of Dr. Who today. Time pretty well spent I felt. We just finished the Rory and Amy arc and now I see no point in continuing to watch the show. I also don't understand the new companion Clara. The first few episodes you see her in (dalek episode and Christmas special) she actually seems to have a bit of character to her, but that seems to be lacking in the first few episodes of the actual season so far.

wow last month of 2018. this year went by too fast. i found a 2nd job at a gas station and my sister in law is against. she keep saying things like im soft, not tough and quiet. yes its true but damn quit saying that shit  its making me mad.  ill be getting some pepper spray to keep myself safe. i sent the manager my schedule from my grocery job and he hasnt gotten back to me. i hope he doesnt start fucking with me like the car wash manager did. my schedule for next week is bare. my hours was cut real bad. if the guy doesnt respond then im not taking the job. i dont have time for games.

i dont want to tell my family about my schedule because they always give me shit. when the neighbor comes over with the pepper spray my sister in law will drive me up the fucking wall. she is so irritating. i just want the lesson over with so she can shut the fuck up.

i deleted my tinder app. it wasnt working out so ill have to find another way to meet guys. maybe ill give my coworker a moment. he is older, only 43 and is sooo annoying to everyone but i feel this magnetism towards him. i felt him up in the bathroom a few times and it was wonderful. he has an amazing ass im in love with. im getting hard just thinking about it. he is my guilty pleasure. one of these days we have to have another sensual session. soon we should get naked and have sex.

i started a new profile on the fake leafgreen. i felt worried so i started fire red on the myboy emulator. that way i can have a full save file to make me feel better when the save file on the fake game get deleted. emulators are a life saver.

i am soooo tired. Today was the busiest day of work that I have worked since I started this job back in March. Whew, what a day. It helped the time go by I guess. We didn't make much at all in tips though given how busy we were. Had/have some anxiety about that past today but that doesn't do anyone any good. I need to look into learning to forgive myself. Anyways, Her and I went and toured an apartment and She didn't like it one bit and kept saying how She hated and didn't want to live in a small town and we had to and She had no choice and it was my fault and I thought all of that was completely unreasonable and unfair. I told Her that and She said She was just joking but She wasn't. Her mood did lighten up though after I reminded Her that it's what people do, move somewhere that is mutually beneficial to both of them and that I moved to our last two places with no complaints solely for Her work. It frustrated me quite a bit actually. I am not trying to make a bigger deal out of it. I played some video games a bit when I got home. Some of us were going to play together but one of them went AFK like right as everyone was ready, like, why even ready up then? That annoyed me. Did a bit of cleaning, She just got done organizing the closet. I am going to take a shower and sleep, might play one game first though.

I bought and played a new video game for a bit which I enjoy. I can really see myself sinking way too much money into it tbh :p but I don't think I have the funds to afford that right now. Her and I watched an episode of Dr. Who together, two episodes actually. They were both pretty enjoyable over all. I am tired now and ready to go to bed.

Alright, so I think my last post might have been a bit more than a week ago. I think I am going to roughly try and summarize my days. Alrighty, Thanksgiving was a good day I felt. I got to see my brother and one of my cousins that I haven't seen in a while. It was quite nice. Everyone just mostly talked which was good. My brother seems to be doing well and he seemed to have a little glow about him when he started to talk about his work and stuff so I am happy for him. I ate some yummy food, but I think I did an alright job with not eating too much. She gossiped about work stuff which is nice, I was glad to see Her not just sitting alone and not talking. After that we went up north to see Her family for the holidays. We got to sleep in the basement which is always the best. In the morning everyone eventually showed up and we played some board games that we brought with us that everyone enjoyed. The gift exchange went well. I got a cool new board game about growing trees and a Mcree funko pop, and a huuuuge bag of candy which I ate all of in like 2 days :p She also got a new board game that was soooooo fun. It was a good day. We had tacos for dinner. The next day we stayed the whole day even though we originally planned on leaving on Saturday. It was nice though, I felt a little guilt about it because I really needed to get some work done, but I think it was worth it overall. We left on Sunday pretty early. I was worried Her dog that was ridding with us might go to the bathroom in my car but I guess she was just having some anxiety. We got home and I don't remember what we did then. We either went to the store the day after or on Saturday. Sunday I really needed to start on my paper but I know I didn't. I did do the majority of my other project that day though so I was a bit productive. Monday I worked both jobs and studied for some exams and finished the rest of my project. Tuesday is the day that I finally actually started working on my paper. It had to be 10 pages and was due at midnight on Thursday so I had my work cut out for me. I let my anxiety get the best of me and cried about it, but I was able to get either 2 or 3 pages done. The next day I woke up early and got a few more pages done before class started and I felt a lot better about it then. I also worked a bit more on it that night and got to around 8 pages. I made some poor choices about bad thoughts and stuff on Wednesday, I just need to accept it, reflect upon it, and move on. Oh, I also had exams Wednesday and Thursday but I felt like they both went really well. Thursday, I finished my rough draft of my paper. I read it over and thought it was alright. I had my girlfriend review it for grammatical content and She hated me for it. :p I think I plan on doing some chores around the house before She gets home/once She's here to make it up to Her. She also made me dinner the past two nights which is nice of Her. She is the best. I didn't have to go to my other job today which I liked. I hope the person is alright, I didn't go because they were sick. But it feels nice to just have the rest of the day off. Wish I didn't have to go and work in the morning though. I will post again later tonight. I would like to do some chores and take an online quiz I need to take today. Alright, that's all for now!"

Alright, that's all for now. I think I ate under my calories for the day, not sure honestly. Don't want to work tomorrow, but life goes on! :)"

the last couple of days being 25 feels like nothing. everything is the same and i still have a childlike mindset.  my pokemon fever is still high but slightly went down when my gba sp stopped charging. i still have my original gba but the sp version is for when i want to play in the dark. they have replacement batteries for cheap on ebay so ill look into that. i wanted to get another original gba model just because. i like those more because they take double A batteries so they last longer than lithium  batteries. im playing heartgold now to make up for lost cause despite the fact that the game is hard af due to aloot of grinding.  i been feeling this rage inside of me again. its hard to feel joy and i am having thoughts and imagination of me telling people off and cursing them out for their behavior. in a way i like those thoughts but it gets me riled up and as im writing this im feeling the anger. i wish i could make it go away. it means i have to force positive thoughts.  its bad luck to have anger because more shitty things can happen.

im still on the whisper app in hopes of finding a guy to hump on in the bathroom. there is the light skin black guy i see at the library every day and he got a little nice booty i could feel on. i dont know if he is  gay and i dont want to offend him.i wouldnt mind grinding on his thighs.  maybe ill have a little luck today. i might help with the anger im feeling.

Alright, time for kind of joint big post I think for the past few days. Overall the past couple of days have been pretty good. Had some issues this morning with some bad thoughts and a bit throughout the day but nothing else much for the day, which is good. I had a good amount of anxiety throughout the week with some dumb stuff but I feel alright now. I have been dieting pretty well and my exams and stuff for school went well yesterday. I had the day off today and did some homework that I just got done, I also played some games and did a few errands that I needed to get done before tomorrow. Not a bad day overall and overall a good week. Her and have been hanging out more lately in general which is good. She asked if I wanted to watch something with Her on Sunday and I initially told Her no but I realized the error of my ways because She doesn't often feel like doing stuff together and we ended up watching more Dr. Who. I am enjoying this show so far, to my pleasant surprise! I wouldn't mind watching some more right now actually. Alright, that's all for now. Happy thoughts and staying positive! Got to get on top of these posts too. "

last couple of days been annoying. this weekend i went out to eat with my other family members and i ended up paying $30 for a meal. that left me dry broke until payday. i was not too happy about that.  i dont want to take money out my savings account. im trying to stay on track of saving.  as for work, it been sooo irritating. i am so done with the car wash job so im looking for a 2nd. a coworker has a job at a gas station and said they were hiring. the manager said he need someone for evenings and that the job is super easy. they pay under the table which gave me reminder of the car wash job. i dont want to work for 10 minutes only to be sent home just because its slow.  I dont trust these under the table paying job. the guy said he would give me a call if they want. so far they didnt so i guess i didnt get the job. at my grocery store job, my two bosses was a pain in the ass. one had a bad attitude and was a complete bitch to me and the other was just rude. yesterday they picked on me and gave me hell all because i liked another manager more than them. when i punched out i practically dashed out the store. my feelings were hurt so i was in my feelings after that and today. im off thankfully and if they try to call me in i will not answer the phone or respond to text. i didnt like how the head manager was a bitch to me. plus she tried to start stuff between and another coworker that works in the customer service. the girl that works in the customer service basically told me off and to keep her name out her mouth.  if the head boss keeps it up i might just quit or request a transfer to another store. she is already known for changing on people and terrorizing them until they quit.  she said she loves me but i dont know. it shows how quick a person can change if you get on their bad side.  i wanted to vent to someone about it but no one will understand or just laugh at me. on other notes, the pokemon sapphire i ordered came in. it is the authentic one so now i can migrate to the ds games.  i also been playing ruby on my phone and pc so i can feel better if the cartridge games battery saves go bad.  i will be looking online for gba backup tools and everdrives so i can move my save files between devices and keep them in the clouds. google clouds that is."

You ever have one of those weeks. Well... I'm having one now. Sunday night I went to sleep feeling the whole classical depression signs. You know, don't want to eat, don't want to move, feeling nothing but a tinge of sadness somewhere.  It took me a while to get to sleep and when I did, well... I didn't really wake up till like Monday afternoon / night. It was a restless sleep but there.

Oh I also forgot to take my antidepressants so that's a thing. Well I didn't forget I just slept through the normal time And didn't want to take them.

Tuesday was more of the same I guess but I woke up earlier went to bed midday ish. Did a few chores.  Felt a little better.

Today is Wednesday morning and we'll after my amazing week I found out the place I've meant to be moving into fell through and my heart has sunk to the point I want to burn myself again. I already wanted to this weekend or maybe earlier in the week (I can't tell) but...

There's also the fact my literal only friend is filled to anxiety and isn't feeling right. My father in all his wisdom is making me feel... He bitches too much like OMFG I DON'T CARE SHUT UP.

I'm going to try sleep since I haven't really slept at all.

P.S.
After what SWIM went through with the tramadol last week they'd take more right now. Even with all the shit they went through and the uneasyness. But they don't have any more pills to abuse.  "

Levi


 My darling love
You are the yellow in the sun. The blue in the Sky. The marshmallow fluff in the clouds. When you think of someone who will always be there, you think of LEVI.

You‚Äôve been through so much. And always maintained such a positive outlook on life. You always said, things would be better. Things aren‚Äôt that bad. Things will always work out.

Until they didn‚Äôt. You couldn‚Äôt take it. You‚Äôve been the strongest for so long. Youve been the glue that holds everything together. And when it was all falling apart for you... who was there? Who was your rock? Who was your ‚ÄúLevi‚Äù?

I hope you know how loved you were. I hope in your heart you understood. How much you changed and shaped this world. You were like no one I had ever met.

Describe Levi:

Levi is tall, skinny, lanky. With dark hair and light eyes. His smile goes for miles. He had the straightest most prettiest teeth you‚Äôve ever seen. He is beautiful beyond description. He loved animals. He loved dogs. He loved women. He loved baseball. He loved family. The idea of family. The idea that one day he‚Äôd have a family. He loved life. No one, could ever be, who he was. He was darling. The most delicate but beautiful strong most confident charming soul. Have you ever met someone who was so confident and full of life and love and confidence? But who also needed someone to call them when there was a thunderstorm? That was him. That was Levi. He was the strongest brightest most optimistic person I‚Äôve ever met. Yet when it stormed... the 12 year old boy came out. He was scared. Alone. And anxious. But I never knew. To what extent. If I could take all of your pain away I would.

Levi,
I know nothing I ever say or feel will be enough to ever bring you back. So I will just speak in your spirit.

Levi,

You are the man we depend on. You are the friend we can call. The favorite uncle. The baby brother. The sweet fianc√©. The sweet country boy who is always happy. The boy who everyone thinks has it all together. Who did you have? Your brothers. And they moved away. You tried so hard to get your life together and you did. But it still wasn‚Äôt enough. You couldn‚Äôt handle the darkness or the pressures of the world.

And here I am. I mourn you. I mourn your spirit. I mourn your energy. I mourn your presence in this world. Do people even understand? The impact you‚Äôve had on this earth??? Do people even know what it is? To experience such a profound loss? No...We go on. We move forward. We keep going. We are but a small blip in this time. In this universe.

All of the pain. The trauma. The heartache. It is all endured. For nothing. You‚Äôre still gone. You‚Äôre still charming and loving and my ‚Äúguardian angel‚Äù. You‚Äôre still the boy I could text and say anything, and you would have the most perfect response.

You‚Äôre lovely. You‚Äôre awesome. You‚Äôre charming. You‚Äôre gorgeous. You‚Äôre the epitome of love and confidence and charm. And now you‚Äôre nothing.

Oh, my Levi. How I wish you would have known how loved you truly are. How much this ugly world needed you. How much I needed you.

They say, Only the good die young.
Now I know what they mean.

It was Saturday morning and we rose early to be on the road by 7am because of the heat.

 We decided not to stay over at lodges or hotels anymore as we did in the past but to rather make planned breakfast runs instead. This entails us taking the bikes to a specific and different restaurant each time and have breakfast there, it would involve a planned route.

The whole point of the exercise is to let off steam after working long hours, enduring stressful weeks in a tough industry.

It was not our first such trip but it was the first trip I document in this way. If the mods find my posts not fitting here, please remove it, no worries.

We stopped at a bridge on our route to [Marken, South Africa](https://i.imgur.com/pL6fCtg.jpg)
30 minutes later I met a [friendly dog](https://i.imgur.com/j2KrSAe.jpg) at a [restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/E8jzugk.jpg) in the middle of nowhere.

So I'm posting this on a  Saturday at 23:13 just for reference okay.

I found out a thing on Sunday the previous weekend which really fucked my mood over. And while SWIM (aka someone who isn't me) decided that taking tramadol instead of self harming was a good idea. SWIM also told me afterwards the following 2 days were literally hell and he couldn't move or anything. He was rudely interrupted midday on the day he took and was forced to move and help someone. He ended up throwing up and making things worse for himself.

So next week. Aka Wednesday I'm getting my own place (kinda.) It's enough for me to actually decorate and stuff so im calling it mine. I also dyed my hair and FYI I either needed to bleach it more get darker pink dye because Arctic fox virgin pink is too light. I'm going to eventually get darker dye and dye it again

I feel okay. Kind of still off kilter but okay. "

Today was mostly bad. Mainly because it turns out I forgot to request days off for next week and it is too late now for me to request them off. I plan on trying to find coverage and if I can't find it just letting my boss know ahead of time that I won't be able to go still. I think that ought to work. I know She will be mad about it so I am just not bringing it up for now unless it ends up becoming an issue. I feel like I could swear that I remember requesting those days off though, it's the weirdest thing and it's making me feel stressed :( I had a rough day at my second job today too which wasn't great. Her and I went to see the new Fantastic Beasts movie though and that was preeeety bad. I wouldn't recommend it. I feel like the plot was over stuffed with a bunch of stuff, the movie didn't feel like it had a cohesive story, and there were an incredibly small amount of fantastic beasts! The film had none of the charm that the first one had. Well, that's all for now, got to work in the morning."

Alright, time for some posts! I have gotten behind on these a bit and I am not sure I am 100% on why. I feel like I remembered earlier in the day yesterday but forgot by the time it was time for me to sleep. Let's see, Tuesday. I remember going to class on Tuesday and I didn't have a quiz in the morning which was a nice surprise but I feel like I understood the first lecture of the day for that class well and I had an exam in the second class of the day. I thought the exam was alright. I know I struggled with bad thoughts a good deal that day and these past few days. I just need to reassess and think things through and follow up with old successful techniques because I feel like the few weeks before were pretty good for me. Got to fix the bad thoughts though. Work went well for that day too even though I had supervision.

&#x200B;

Wednesday was rough. I made some bad choices later in the night but didn't relapse or edge or anything but did have some bad thoughts and stuff. I had some bad thoughts about a few classmates. I just need to calm down. I got my exam results back though and I got a 100% which is awesome and I was excited about. I ended up studying for my Thursday exam really late but I ended up doing well.

&#x200B;

Today I made some weird eye contact/potentially could be seen as flirty or something glances at some random stranger I sat across. Nothing happened of course and I just got up and left when I needed to leave, and I was probably just in my own head about it, but I just need to not be approaching life that way. Idk where Her and I go to move to. I need to get my act together. I had an easy exam today which went well. The drive home took a while. Just trying to relax and not worry about things. Looking at places to live now! That's all for now."

I hadn't updated in a month.

I swear, everytime I think something good is going on... something bad tells me otherwise.

I got a call today from the doctor's office and it turns out I have a mass in my uterus. I had an ultrasound done last week.

I'm not pregnant, otherwise the urine test results and ultrasound would've said so and I'm still a virgin lol.

I don't know how this mass came about. I had a UTI in June and then the pain kept happening. I for sure have prolapse too because there was some weird pop and wetness and... yeah. The tightness and heaviness came because I wasn't sitting correctly after a few months of UTI symptoms. It's gotten better slowly in that regard because of my diligence in light exercising.

I have been consistent (or almost so, at least every morning and almost every night) with doing stretches and core strengthening exercises for the past 2 months and the pain goes away mostly. I can move without being as scared of hurting myself. But there are still times when I still get pain in my pelvic area.

So to hear that it's a mass is scary. I might have to get surgery and I don't have money for that, especially in the United States where it's thousands of dollars. It's better than dying though.

My doctor put in a request and referral for an MRI and a gynecologist so I'll have to call back tomorrow to see if it's approved by my insurance.

I live the most easygoing, boring, and chill life. I work in physical labor. And when I think I'm about to finally start changing my life, my body decides to change too. I'm so sad right now.

I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this. At least my new doctor has been more proactive in getting me help than my old doctor, whose staff acted like I was exaggerating my pain and symptoms."

3 days back I started reading The Godfather by Mario Puzo. The first chapter is called Wedding on Long Island. It's Don Vito's daughters wedding day. He is taking care of his 'business' in a private room. After discussing the matters and making the decisions, he goes outside and dances with his daughter to a show Sicilian music.

After reading this part , I realised what a transition it was - he is of course a Don and a feared man, he'ss taking care of the business , had to make hasty decisions, and these decisions better bring him good news etc.... So it's kind of like a tense, adrenaline, fierce, evil mood. Then soon he coolly leaves to dance with his daughter on her wedding day - this is cheerful, sweet, savoury, merry moment. In this moment I realised that Don Vito had been calm the whole time. He didn't fear or worry when he was making mob decisions few minutes earlier, and now when he's dancing he's not ecstatic, but happily content. So maybe when you know things are...well actually my exact thoughts then were - when things are alright and you know it, and you know how your actions are going to bring the result you want, like nothing could go wrong and everything could be handled in a matter of hours, we feel so much content, calmness, just short of bliss.

I was taking a poop today and I was thinking-  I hate festivals now, hate people wishing it on texts. I used to love it. Used to wait days ahead, make plans about activities, dress, food, pranks, preparations. Now it's just more painful than a normal day - The wishes reminding me of something I don't care at all now that I used to love. And then I realised, I used to hear people saying they hate festivals...and that now I can understand why . Like a great scientist doing experiments on himself, I can now have a bit of idea about the person who says he hated holidays. The Long Island Wedding crossed my mind, like I would have also loved holidays even today. Who doesn't want that perfect festival, enjoying with family, stuffing food, exchanging gifts, mingling with friends, having a fun night outside or sitting inside room sharing anecdotes and happy incidences while noisy kids run around after each other. Right? Maybe some don't want that. Because of the obvious reason that they cannot have that. Because not everything is alright, and nothing can be done .........

Idk if someone gifts this moment or life, I still think there might be some people who would still not take it. This now reminds me of a situation I had thought years back ( and AJ I hate that you ruined it with your own theories) - before birth you are given a choice to be born in the family of Bill Gates and to have a very standard happy life, or to be born to say some poor houdehold and growing up with many challenges, what would you choose? That time I had thought a lot on it ..weeks...asking this question to my friends. Now I do not want to think anymore on it - out of exhaustion and not because my response changes.

PS- remember that balck and white song you heard on TV while lunching... something about dadada... remember it

I hate writing to myself sometimes. Diaries always make me feel so upset and sad with my life. Sometimes I think it does more harm than good to write everything down. I think though, I spend most of the day with these negative thoughts and find bullshit ways to distract myself with fun youtube videos and games instead of coming face to face with my emotions. I hate acknowledging them; they just prove how terribly sad and pathetic I am.


The realization about how much I care and think what others think about me is so depressing. I police my every thought, action, and idea, afraid of how others will react. I hate it. I hate that I feel no good at anything. But, the smarter side of me says, ""Well if you tried anything for more than an hour you'd probably get better"", then I just slink back in my chair and turn on loud music to drown out my thoughts.


Why don't I just try harder? You made it this far with almost no family or friends. What are you afraid of? You wallow in your sadness and about how you can never make friends. Sure that one girl in class said, ""I don't think we'd ever be friends out of this class"", so what, right? What if those other girls didn't want to be your friends and go out for lunch? Fuck them right? \*sigh\* Am I boring? Am I self centered? I greet others, I ask plenty questions. I've took on drinking to try socializing more. I don't like it though. I'm twenty four years old, how is it that I haven't hung out with anyone besides my boyfriend since high school?


Sometimes I think that if I left this world, no one would remember or care for me other than my boyfriend. My family don't call me, my mother won't say ""I love you too"" when I tell her I love her (as if that's really new). I feel like I really don't care.


I carry it all though. I try to tough it out everyday. I see someone sad or having a tough day, I stop and ask how they're doing or crack a lame joke. Surely, there are things worth living for, even without anyone, right?


The air is crisp and cold outside. Stepping outside I smell the smoky aroma of enticing meat being barbecued by neighbors. I can almost hear that crisp little clack, popping the lids of their Budlights and Coors. Dogs are barking into the late night and howling at the train's echoing horn. I almost feel it vibrating in my chest. Little pitter patters of soft feet scurry the yard and glowing gold eyes flash at me before disappearing under the tall brush that lines my fence. Harold approaches me and with a loud and obnoxious screech demands my attention. I love this cat, he is a whiny little bastard, but his beautiful striking orange fur soothes me. Cradling him I feel his paws draping themselves over my shoulder and as expected his claws carefully dig into my back and he begins kneading on me. He nuzzles his cold little snout against my cheek and automatically he turns on that little motor boat purr of his lol.


Surely, a god couldn't have been as cruel enough to put me on this world to simply die at my own hands? Is there one? What kind of lesson am I suppose to learn here? Why give me such a life?


Why am I so afraid to dive in? Failure?
Life is so funny these days. So much technology we can live in comfort with our fears. Afraid of ridicule? That's okay. Nothing like anonymity through the use of light boxes and this crazy invention that can spread information faster than the blink of an eye throughout the whole globe. Crazy.


Fifty years back, I'd probably be using some elaborate mystery mail club or something lol, ah, I remember, they had weird sections in the classifieds sometimes.

I dont even remember the last time I was here. Guys in my life have changed. Brother got married. I have 2 jobs....

One thing at a time I guess. I've gone back to my downward rut. Going back to my therapist in 2 weeks to see if it helps. But I just feel maxed stressed, on the verge of breaking, and exhausted from keeping it all together.

I've been diagnosed with HPV and have had testing and biopsies to see if I have cancer and to prevent the abnormal cells from becoming cancer. Hopefully get good news back on that soon. Because it's super scary.

Even with 2 jobs, I've been sitting all week with less than $2 in my account. I work at a retail store on Saturdays but a 12 hour shift. I'm about to quit because it's just too much. 40 hours at my main job then 12 hours nonstop is exhausting.

I havent lost weight, last I knew, but I keep working at it. Haven't smoked in 3 months! I've wanted to but I haven't!

My brothers wedding was perfect. I love my new sister! They invited me to go to their Thanksgiving, but idk if I want to... I think that doubt just comes from the blah I'm in. My best friend I havent seen in 2 years surprised me there and it was the best thing to happen to me in years.

Normal work is stressful. I keep messing up, and that's just not me to make this many errors. I'm just so spread thin with everything else.

I'm just gonna wine it up tonight. Wish this new guy would come over... anyways, thanks yall"
0,"A memo to myself and anyone that can relate
  **The Aftermath**

I guess you don‚Äôt know how fucked up you truly are until you ruin something that it is so meaningful to you.  I should probably be writing this in my diary, but I really cannot be bothered.  Plus it is easier to type.  I am no writer by any means but I need to express some things.

Maybe there is a problem, a problem with me and maybe it is something which I have never really tried to combat, I am not sure. When something you love, rather think you love (since it‚Äôs the only romantic love that you know), destroys all trust and empathy in you over and over... apathy and dissociation to the self occurs. Sometimes this dissociation results in a dissatisfaction to one‚Äôs self, to one‚Äôs body or just one‚Äôs life. It sucks and you mentally and physically pay the price for something that someone did to you, how they made you feel. Mentally and physically in this sense being self-blaming and self-sabotage which can take the form of many different things. Yes, it was not my fault however, we act in ways to help ourselves sometimes in ways we shouldn‚Äôt - I know that doesn‚Äôt really make that much sense to read but I am sure some people can understand that sentence. Anyway. The reason for all of this squabble is to express the aftermath, the aftermath of how something that detained you from expressing how you truly feel may (in some circumstances) implode onto future relationships.

This ladies & gentlemen is truly the effect of not healing properly. And that is not your fault, not always anyway. Some people are not understanding enough to want to help you with your demons and run, they run. Sometimes you run, you run from the ones that can and are willing, and then you may‚Ä¶ you may even take for granted the one‚Äôs who can and lose them. That‚Äôs the one that hurts the most.


We talk extremely loosely about self-love, self-acceptance, self-everything. Yet do we really know what that is, the one‚Äôs who have been hurt I mean, do they really know when they have self-loved or whether they are finally enough? Is there some kind of scale? I think not. And no, I am not saying people who have been hurt are not enough, but during the aftermath of such hurtful experiences we OFTEN feel this way which acts as a precursor to avoiding relationships in the future or negatively affecting the ones that matter most. Maybe not for everyone but for me it did.

Some time in your life, the one‚Äôs that have felt hurt in some way (which is probably all of us), will have to undergo some sort of mental therapy or even physical therapy or some other ‚Äútherapy‚Äù to help you to not mess everything else up in your life when the problem was never you in the first place.  It was him, her, them, the one‚Äôs who did wrong and who made you hurt. They should pay, not your future.  I know, I know, it is easier said than done. But it must be said before you destroy all the better moments and relationships you will fall into on your journey.

Alright, time for two posts. Yesterday was.... so long ago it feels? I am trying to remember the day. I know I did very little in terms of homework. Her and I watched a whole lot of Dr. Who together which was actually enjoyable. I need to clean up my thoughts right now, they're not getting me anywhere useful. Anyways, I did get a good chunk of my study guide for my exam on Thursday done yesterday which is a positive but I didn't do any of my paper which is bad. I need to remember my work bag tomorrow for school and I feel like I am going to forget. Well, that's all for Sunday. Today was a meh day. I trained officially for the first time at work today which was new to me. I liked my trainee a lot though which was awesome. He was a pretty chill dude it seemed and his listened and worked well. After that I went to my other job which didn't go as well for the vast majority of the time but got surprisingly better toward the end of the session. I got home to see that She was just finishing up making dinner for Her and I, She is so sweet. :) She wants to practice cooking She said. I enjoyed the meal overall, the meat was a bit overcooked, but that is how we learn! I gave up on having something to turn into my professor by midnight and instead found some potential sources and am now studying for a few things I have tomorrow shortly before going to sleep. Alright, that's all for now."

I also googled ""how to tie a noose"" purely out of curiosity and I got a helpline number with the tagline ""are you feeling suicidal"" lol, same thing happened on YouTube too which I found funny. Anyway I found out how to do it and it's suprisingly easy lol. I'm weirdly happy about it.

The manager there never paid me my money. he said he would call me when the checks come in but he never did. ohh when i came in to work on thursday, half the staff didnt show up until only a few came in. we were short staffed but we had it under control.  i only worked 4 hours before getting sent home because it was really slow.i hate those kind of jobs where weather affects the business. if it rains then the car wash gets no business and everyone goes home. at the grocery store job, people flock to the store.  i have a job interview on saturday. i hope i get the job and have a manager willing to work around my grocery store schedule. it would be so better than working at the car wash under shady conditions. i been feeling irritated the last few days. that means something is going to piss me off soon. i know the grocery job is since they want to give me more days to work. im happy with 3 to 4 days. i hate that place. im getting angry thinking about it. i just want a stable two jobs for once.

Or maybe he has a secret agenda and wants to make me his assistant drug dealer. omg too much imagination this morning. im so quick to judge so i have alot of thoughts about the manager there.  on other things the save file on my pokemon emerald game was deleted because the goddamn gameboy decided to shut off while i was saving. that fucked my night and to add to insult, the gba cable i borrowed from my coworker didn‚Äôt work so now im feeling some kind of way. right now im going to start a new game on pokemon diamond. im so upset because i put in 90 hours on that emerald game.  i learned the hard way to pay attention to the battery indicator. god i hope i make it today. i just hate when all the effort you put into something go to waste. im staying away from the gameboy and will be focusing on the ds games. the pain is real. i gotta get up soon and get ready for work. it fucking hurts!!!!!"

If you saw this post despite not being a commoner on reddit, congrats. You're stalking me. And you may finally learn my true self.
Let me start by how i describe myself:
Unpredictable, Enigmatic, Sane.
Like any other people, i have human traits. I'm kind, compasionate, a good listener and pretty much how you would describe a normal person. But yet, every now and then i'd feel different, i don't get fazed by unfortunate events.
Probably becausr just like a normal person, i havr experienced alot of problems. Especially family ones. My future is uncertain, it feels like it will always lead to failure. But i'm a normal person, so i'm positive that it will turn out fine. I love myself, but also hate some parts of it. Despite that, i would never go so far to say that i wish i was dead. Though i say that every night as a joke. I prefer living, even if it hurts. Because im normal after all. I don't like talking, i prefer to listen. I can't also seem to trust people easily. Almosy everyone i have met has already betrayed my trust. I can't seem to bring myself to love properly aswell. I never bern betrayed by love before, infact, i betrayed love. I hate people who has the audacity to ignore. And if you're hated by me, then you're a terrible person, because i rarely hate. I don't get angry aswell, only disappointed. I want to feel love again, but nothing so far has made me feel it. I hate this part of me. So far, thats how i describe myself. There you have it, my true self."

0,"All I ever wanted was a friend
A lot of people have told me that I had thoughts of an older person when I was young, I believed them and I kept those views and they helped me make it day by day. What I knew I was missing was a friend, not a relationship but I so wanted that too. At the moment I‚Äôm 18, so still pretty young, I go to school, I have a job, and in a couple of years if things go well I‚Äôll be a nurse.

Well back on topic, 4 years ago during freshman year is when I lost my grandpa, after that I was aloof with most things, and it was a week before christmas and I never really mention the bad about me cause out there somewhere, someone has it worse than me. So a few months pass by and then there‚Äôs this girl that messages me, we talk and she‚Äôs cool and in my mind I‚Äôm thinking that she can be my friend, the first person I can tell my secrets and emotions and just be friends, but how naive I was, she started having these emotions towards me and I didn‚Äôt feel them back.

Our friendship declined after that because of time spent away and then when school started back up again after a winter break we picked up again by talking and stupid me thinking she shouldn‚Äôt have these feelings but not caring cause she was nice and new and full of energy, she was just my friend.

A couple months in I get a girlfriend (not her) and I don‚Äôt regret any of that experience (another story for another day) and it was my first relationship ever. First kiss, first date, first everything, well shit happens and somehow she continues being my friend. After half a year my ex and I ended it and well I was trying to calm myself down, keeping my secrets to myself until I was calm, until I could speak about it, taking care of my own problems because they were mine.

This friend of mine stayed by my side for the longest time with feelings still being amongst her. A couple months later I got another girlfriend, one of her former friends and shit happened. Typical bullshit teenage drama I won‚Äôt get into but I didn‚Äôt care I was with this beautiful amazing girl but eventually like everything else in my life, I screw up.

After tip toeing around trying not to get anyone hurt and fights and more bullshit teenage drama, me and my girlfriend were in a good place finally until this party my friends had. I was so excited, I was an idiot.

This party was at the beach at a friend‚Äôs condo where they drank and got fucking wasted. We had this sleeping arrangement and it was all ruined when there‚Äôs people drunk passed out. So this friend was there and she was scared or whatever, there was literally no place to sleep but the ground or this couch thing, so it was her on the left, me in the middle, and another sober friend to my right, I put my back towards her and I dozed off.

In the middle of the night where I was asleep, I felt like I was having this dream, like one of those ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù dreams, turns out I wasn‚Äôt dreaming, her hand was down right in my shit and I was trying to get to hers, it felt like half a minute before I finally came to and I pushed her off and ran into the bathroom crying and hating myself. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I did, how I fucking cheated.

After coming back I told her I‚Äôm sorry, I fucked up by sleeping next to her. I was crying silently, I went to the floor where my backpack was there and I went in and fetched out my little pocket knife and I tried slashing my hands and my legs disgusted and ashamed of what I did. I hate myself for it. I wanted to kill myself, I wanted to be punished.

The next day I left, I left my friends behind, a shirt, a friendship, and my dignity, I cried and when I broke the news to my girlfriend she punched me and cried and she left. She was dressed up so nice when I saw her because she knew I was sad and I had to break the news to her in person. I felt horrible. I dropped my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that same day through what seemed the worst way which was through text, and calling her a mistake. My mistake.

After 6 months which is now, I still se her very often because same college program and I got back with my girlfriend and although it‚Äôs not the same, our relationship has grown exponentially. Often I think about if I‚Äôm doing the right thing by being with her, I feel like she‚Äôll be better off without me but then again I really don‚Äôt want to lose her. I‚Äôm 18 and young and whatever but I feel like I don‚Äôt have much left, just a feeling.

That friend that I was talking about, now just a shadow that walks and talks to the rest of my friends, which is why I no longer have many. I no longer want any, I just want to be better, I just want to be the best version of myself again, I just want to disappear cause I know I‚Äôll end up disappointing again.

I know the only real friend I have are you guys, just strangers with similar or worse problems than I do, if you took the time to finish all of this then I applaud you, thank you for allowing me to have this place to say what I gotta say, nothing beats friendship then admitting my deepest regrets and mistakes to strangers.

Today was a pretty decent day. It kind of flew by. I had some anxiety and bad thoughts and stuff while at work, but I feel like it didn't get too out of hand. Work was pretty fun today. I woke up in a super good mood for some reason and I am not sure why. I have the next two days off and am really excited about it. All I did tonight was play a toooon of video games. I just played like.... probably at least 7 hours of Overwatch. Oh man, it was a good time though. I'd like to play more tomorrow but I do have some homework and studying to do. Priorities and all that jazz. I was trying to get lootboxes to get cool new skins and got 0 new legendary! The one legendary I got was coins... Unlucky event for me so far. Maybe that luck will change though, we will have to wait and see. Alright, I reallly need to shower. That's all for now."

so far the car wash gig been okay. only problem is the long 10 hour days and me being on my toes all of the time. i have to be quick. on the 3rd day i made a mistake of sending one of the car through the wash with the window down and not cleaning one of the floor mats. one of the manager yelled at me twice for it. the head manager kept telling him to call him about my work schedule at my job.  i call him and no answer. a day later he called back and i told him one of the days i can work. im free one day and offered to work a few hours on the other. he said no to that saying thats not how he does things and then he said he would give me a call if he needs me. that hurts, i really wants to keep that job but he makes it seem like he can replace me at anytime. he said he has 15 applications sitting at his desk.  he can fire me at any given moment. its one of those jobs where so many people come and go. i don‚Äôt want to be one of those people. i want to have a solid spot there. everyday i worry about getting that call saying im no longer needed.  i have my main job at the grocery store so it won‚Äôt me too much. my feelings and pride would be hurt. i have to get up early for work, i hate it. on other things i hacked my nintendo 2ds but im playing my nintendo dsi to preserve it. its very special like a gem.  i still don‚Äôt have a bf or a close male friend. its so hard to find ."

One leader of the house is positioned to lead a department. Weeks ago, selected employees went on training on a certain subject which benefited both the employees and the clients. Without her instructions I made my own initiative to collect and monitor the attendance, which she by the way gave me the instructions just before the training ends. I complied.

It was not my responsibility to record the training on the back end which I did since I have to file them to 201 anyway. Today, there was a back and forth or calls and emails regarding the number of employees that‚Äôs supposed to be given the certificates and her dispense on me blaming me for not doing my job properly which was supposed to be hers.

Today was a pretty good day overall. I had some bad thoughts and stuff but nothing too bad. Her and I actually did something after work today which is really exciting! We talked yesterday about how we need to try and become friends again pretty much. Life's hard, but so it goes I suppose. We ended up watching a scary movie together! It wasn't scary though I suppose, more like a suspense movie. It's called Hush. I remember us learning about it years ago and thinking it looked interesting. It was pretty good overall I though. Had me saying wtf at the main character a few times, but that's that I guess. I need to do some homework tomorrow after work, maybe She would want to do something fun tomorrow too.

So... I decided to buy some artic fox virgin pink hair dye and some manic panic bleach to change my hair style up again. I had pink hair at the beginning of the year but ruined it and went to braids which is cool and fun but I've had them in too long. They're grown out like crazy and starting to dread again.

I ordered it knowing it was a long weekend so hopefully I can get all my braids out and stuff this weekend and save my hair then the dye and bleach will come next week hopefully.

I offered to pay half of the bill but she declined and insisted. Im blessed to have her. She was feeling down today tbh. I didn't know what to say cause I can't really answer her questions as I don't even know the answer myself. The best thing I could I do is listen and give her some positive thoughts at best.

Depressing story of the day. My three week fling with G has finally come to an end. I was right that it was never gonna work out. He said he wanted to be friends instead but I know that it will never happen. My initial intention was to be friends. As time goes by, that starts changing and it conflicted me to thinking if I like him or not. I actually wanna be friends cause he is for one a very interesting person. He just don't wanna hurt my feelings as much as possible. The best thing I can do to forget him is delete his number and block him on social media. He already unmatched me on tinder so no need for me to do that. Starting now, as I read this, I should start focusing on myself more again. No more silly things that can break my heart again and go back to what I was before. Positive thoughts. If I'm gonna read this in the future. I hope you are having a great time."

Wow, day 700! absolutely crazy to get this far. It has been a long time. This day was great from what I remember! We slept in a bit more than we planned, but still got up and left at a good time. I slept for most of the car ride because I was quite tired, not sure why. We met up with everyone and had some delicious Mexican food for lunch. After that we went shopping for snacks and finally checked into the hotel.  Ok, what did we do after that. I think we ended up going bowling first, which I thought was pretty alright at the time even though I am usually not a big fan of bowling, afterwards we went to an arcade and played some games there for a bit. And still after that we had time to go and have fun at the water park for at least an hour. Oh, and we ended up getting some crazy guy kicked out which felt good. After the waterpark we all got dressed  and got some local pizza for dinner that I loved (She thought it was only ok). That's all the big highlights for this day.

Sunday was also great. We got up pretty early, had some very 'meh' panera bread for breakfast, and then started this quest thing for the kids. It was actually pretty cool I though. They got a toy wand and had to go and follow some clues and point the wand at certain things to get treasures and other stuff. So we did that for a little while and eventually decided to go for a car ride so that the kids could nap. The kids fell asleep and we also drove to some sand dunes near us which were pretty. For dinner we went to a local burger place that was probably my favorite food on the trip (that or the pizza). She liked it too which was good. We came back... I am not sure. We might have tried to play a card game? or maybe that was the night before, I think the night before. Anyways, I passed out this night I was so tired.

Today started well. I ate left overs for breakfast but nobody else ate. We finished up the magic quest, spent the rest of our credits on food, and spent the rest of our arcade points on a few different games. The kid ended up with a decent amount of tickets and was able to pick out a pretty cool pair of sunglasses from the prize box thing. During all that we packed all of our things and checked out, before our parties went separate ways we all got lunch at a different local burger place that I wasn't impressed with at all. She drove home because I don't want to drive Her new car. When we got back we couldn't find Her card which She was pretty sure She handed back to me after She got gas but I couldn't remember. She was really mad with me about it. We eventually found it in Her car and She still seemed mad and I told Her that She should just carry the card Herself from now on if She is going to get so mad at me if I potentially lose. I don't want to do something that feels fairly thankless (although She does say thanks and stuff) if She is going to get so mad at me for losing a card. She can just keep track of it Herself then, imo. I am trying to do Her a favor by carrying it for Her. Anyways, I am trying to not get anymore heated about it. Now we're both mad as She didn't like when I told Her that She should just carry it from now on. Ugh. I need to study a bit and then sleep. That's all for now."

We make the most of our lives as we can.

To fall in love with someone is to be the most vulnerable. To open yourself up to them. To kiss tenderly and peer into their eyes and know that this is what you want for the rest of your life.

That, is powerful.

To go so long feeling alone and feeling unwanted, brushed aside, to then suddenly have this person. This incredible person. It makes everything worth it. Every long hard day and every wet pillow leads up to this.

And then they leave you. For good.

And there's nothing left but countless more wet pillows, and the loneliness creeping back in.

We are born alone.

N. One of my good friends. Smart, strong minded and has a fierce attitude. She tends to believe on what she wants to believe and i admire her for that. Thanks for being with me since high school :)

A. Also bestfriend, former Mutual Attraction too. Our story is weird. We used to like each other back then but im glad it didnt work out. I mean she became one of my closest friends after all.

I guess he wasn't that interested. Thankful for him for listening to me everyday. If only we can be friends but its going to be hard.

So... I normally don't have anxiety. But due to my health and the shitty healthcare system, I became extremely stressed yesterday. My chest was super tight, I had a hard time breathing fully for hours because I was so stressed.

I was stressed because I read more about prolapse and when women reach menopause, estrogen stops being produced and estrogen helps keep the pelvic floor nice and strong. Also what if I want kids but I get prolapse again? But worse? It'll end up in surgery and I'm not made of money, especially in America.

I reached out to my older brother who lives in another country and I hardly vent to him unless he calls me first. I broke down when I wanted to update him on my frustrations and he couldn't handle hearing me like that so he had to hang up. He reached out to his best friend who called me right after my bro hung up. My anxiety was through the roof. He said that his wife might be able to get me an appointment which was reassuring. But thinking back on it, it's okay if I don't get the appointment... I suppose. Just because I'm not in a lot of pain right now. I was super super anxious though and I just wanted reassurance and advice. My health has improved compared to before I didn't do any workouts. It's crazy. The progress was very slow, I only expected to just keep doing this... like forever.

My bro told me to add his other best friend and his best friend's wife and I reached out to them too. The wife has been through a lot as well, longer than I have, though it wasn't prolapse but she understands what it's like to have incompetent doctors. She was encouraging and I appreciate that. I really wish the human body wasn't so complicated, it would make all our lives easier.

Anyway... I'm going to try to keep at it and do the core/pelvic floor exercises. The wife told me it's possible I won't fully recover for a whole 6 months, but that is reassuring that I could be at 100% next year. I was thinking I might have to deal with it for the rest of my life..."

Anywho I found out at 6pm I had to jump in a car for like 3 to 5 hours to pick up my nephew and niece for a few days. That sucked also it was a long car ride and long car rides aren't a really good for me. Seeing my niece and nephew wasn't too bad. It was good tbh. Just the whole driving. Didn't pick them up till 10:30pm

We stopped in to a place at 3am and slept there for a few hours. That was good but my niece is bad. She was vertical when she fell asleep then managed to do a whole 90 degrees till she was horizontal.

Uuuuhh I'm mostly sleepy and calm right now. I got like 3 hours of sleep maybe 5. I also need to take my happy pills.

And this is today's post.

Back to talk about my health again. Not a fun post.

So a few days ago, on the 1st of October, I was supposed to see my doctor. I was going to change doctors sooner but I needed a referral to a gynecologist. Unfortunately my doctor never put in that referral like he said he would. I waited all of September for that and he never delivered. Also, they kept changing schedules and on the day of, they changed again. Apparently they called me but my phone has no record of them calling me. And they don't leave voicemails. And guess who had called off work that day to make it to the appointment? Fun. The doc was gone before I got there and was gone before my appointed time. I had an argument with the desk person. I told them my frustration of having to keep waiting and continuously getting rescheduled. They told me I was exaggerating my symptoms (pelvic pain from prolapse issues now that I identified what was bothering me, which resembles uti issues). So I changed doctors by phone and what phone people said was different from what the desk people said. I called the new doctor to verify and for sure, the desk people were wrong... and the desk people said that I didn't understand. I honestly think they don't understand. They were very rude and insensitive. I don't like to argue with people unless absolutely necessary. They've even joked once about me waiting for the restroom (uti issue) but it was a long time because one of the staff was in there. Who laughs about inconveniencing people with an infection? No one with a uti should hold in their bladder because it can make it worse, and they laughed. So unprofessional all around. It was a very very shit day. I have cried because of them in the past and on that day. I hope they're shut down for how terribly run they are. (the doc didn't even know I had an allergic reaction another time when I asked, he said it was a side effect.. turns out it was shock smh)

Later I went to urgent care because the Planned Parenthood doc told me I had some bacteria in my urine and wanted to prescribe an antibiotic. I was concerned it would get worse. They allowed me in and checked my urine, it actually seemed ok which reassured me. They also prescribed cipro... but that antibiotic has a blackbox warning on it and has a rep for causing tendonitis and ruptures in the achilles heel and muscle tendons. I took the prescription slip that was handed to me because I didn't want to be rude... but I didn't go get the prescription filled. It's been a few days and I don't have signs of a uti so maybe I flushed it out...? I hope I'm not speaking too soon, I have a tendency to do that...

After that I unloaded on my old friend Jon about my day and he made me feel a bit better. I felt bad about telling him such a heavy thing but he really appreciates honesty and he said it put things into perspective for him. That he thought he had it bad... but I told him that suffering isn't a contest and any concern he had was valid. After that he told me some fun stuff in return about his trip to Mexico City. He and his boyfriend Huan have this relationship where they banter and bicker but in good fun. Jon also told me stuff about his family issues and concerns about his work, like a business lowballing him or him getting possibly sued for selling his own work, which was putting a lot of stress on him. I work in retail so I don't have half his issues but I wish I had the expertise to help him too. Also we ate and watched a drama on netflix together until I had to go home and surprisingly my uber was 38 cents! I was shook. The driver was nice.

For my health I'm hoping to get a pessary in the future for my prolapse (and have it diagnosed as medically necessary so my insurance knows). I do want to fly out and visit my sis in the winter but with the change in air pressure I'm worried my prolapse would worsen when the airplane descends during landing. In the past week I've managed to make my prolapse reverse to the point where I'm not worried about it falling out should I do some labor at my work, but when I move the wrong way it does hurt. It's not as tight in my pelvic area, like when I press down from the top, but I'm not at my 100%. I feel pains when I need to eat, I can't skip a meal. I've been diligent so far in doing pelvic exercises at home to ease the pain and to keep the pain away... working my core muscles does make me feel good too as I'm not doing hardcore activity and wakes me up.

But yeah... other than that I want to go to Disneyland with my youngest sis. I won't ride the rollercoasters for now so it rules out some fun but I want to see the decorations amd buy cute Halloween stuff. I've always wanted to visit during October and since I've had health scares I feel like it would be nice to not think about the stresses of life for a bit. Idk how long of a life I'll have to best to make the most of it."

I havent done this in over a month. And I feel a lot has gone down hill.

I told the guy I was seeing that I was falling for him. I got friendzoned, which I knew would happen. He told me from the beginning he wasnt looking for a serious relationship. But despite all that, I still feel something for him. Im trying to move on but he's making it rather difficult.

I have gone to therapy in about a month either. I can't afford it. I feel I need to go but after my brothers wedding.

I was $1000 behind on bills. And my brother paid for everything to be caught up. I feel bad he had to but it has helped tremendously.

I'm going to the gym on a regular basis, so there's some good news. Haven't lost weight but it's all still new.

I was diagnosed with HPV. I'm still waiting for the results to see if its cancerous. But before talking to the doctor, it's a scary diagnosis because it can mean so many things, even though most of the time it means nothing. I haven't told my family because I'm not sure if it's worth it. I feel that's part of the reason I was friendzoned, even though he has repeatedly told me it isn't.

Starting to feel lonely and depressed at home more often and it sucks. I was doing so good for a while, probably because I fell so hard for him and he made me feel so much better. But I haven't seen him in over 2 weeks.

Once the wedding is over, I'll try to go back to therapy. See if anything improves. At least come spring I'll be mostly debt free but that's so far."

I mean today was okay got some sushi which was heavenly and got some art and sketching supplies. I need to work on my sketching it'll give my something to strive towards and help me with my tattoo designs. The only thing I didn't get was coloring pencils but I did get some watercolor paints so yay??? If this goes anyway I'd love to get a few copic markers.

I figured out why my bro called me. It seems like he wanted to get ahold of our parents.

Wow, one of the exams I had today had a question on it that was some straight BS. It was actually something that we never talked in lecture, wasn't in the book, and wasn't in the powerpoints that we went over in class. That one question is worth 5% of our whole class grade. WTF! I am quite annoyed about it and so was my friend after. The other exam I had though was suuuuper easy and short. I have another exam tomorrow with that same professor for a different class and I am just not that worried even though I haven't studied for it yet. I just got done finally making my presentation. It isn't all that great, but it is done! I think I can get at least a B, and that is what we are shooting for here (I guess).  Ugh. I want to take a nice relaxing weekend off but I have so many thing to do.

Woah, did I not do one of these last night? I feel like I did. Weird. Yesterday was the worst day in a while with bad thoughts, idk if it's something like a stress copying mechanism or what. Either way it isn't helping and it isn't healthy. Yesterday had a lot of anxiety because I had to study and get a presentation started. All I did yesterday was study and didn't get anything done for my presentation. I also didn't do a small amount of work stuff that I needed to attend to which I'll do now.

Just had a breakup a month ago. Was fun while it lasted but couldn't handle the fact that our age difference is affecting our relationship to the point where I dont see him as the same person when we started dating. It felt like an emotional baggage whenever we would meet. Long story short, i broke up with him cause I didnt wanna hurt him even further and it made me felt like that im an asshole because I broke up with him for a stupid reason. Im a douchebag as i told myself all the time but Im happy with the decision i made. I think its better to tell the truth than to prolong something where you think its not gonna work.

Talking to a new person again. Been interesting so far. Taking it reallh slow this time just to be sure. I'm scared of falling in love again. I saw his tumblr account containing some information about him and tbh it kinda made me even more paranoid. The more i think about it the more it felt like its not going to work. The same situation as last time. We havent even had our first date yet. He's usually the only person i talk to at the end of the day which comforts with me ease. Im probably overthinking this time but idk what to do next now. I wish i never saw his tumblr account. I started having to think that im not good enough again.

i started highschool a good 23 days ago (the 5th) and Oh Boy its actually not that bad :)

grades wise, i'm not doing amazing, but thats because we've barely had assignments, let alone quizzes or projects. i have a good grasp in all my classes, i'm only really struggling in honors spanish (i totally understand the language, but speaking it is harder than writing it). I've made the dumb mistake of cutting class! amazing ! im so good at this thing :) but don't worry, i didn't get caught or in trouble and i cut classes that i knew i would be able to risk (i took algebra last year, so cutting two classes didnt impact anything). still is sorta bad that i've cut 5 periods worth of class y i ke

socially im doing okay. i have plenty of friends, all of whom i actually like, ignoring a few flaws they have. theres this one really, reeeeally cute guy who i like and he likes me back :) ive mentioned him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9g1yh1/i_need_help_with_a_boy/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9jslcn/uwu/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=teenagers)

Hi it's been a while. A month since I posted.

In the past month I went to BTS's concerts at the Staples Center with some friends. Bought tons of merch. It was fun.

In regards to my health, I have reason to believe I have Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse. I've been treating it like an injury because it has the potential to get worse should I exert myself or even sit incorrectly... Stage 2 is when my internal organs (unsure which one) is barely behind my vagina, not peeking out. But I'm close and that's what scares me. Stage 3 could mean surgery.

The pelvic floor is a set of muscles that acts like a boat to hold up my internal organs. The ""boat"" was weakened and thus my internal organs descended and created pressure. Since women have a hole, the vagina, it gets pretty bad in stage 3 and 4 territory.

It explains why I had uti symptoms for months, constant trips to the bathroom, pain when I pressed on my abdomen... it was so stressful and painful, but not to the point I needed a hospital. But I feel pain in the vagina now, like something is trying to come out. I looked and... I saw a lump that wasn't there before. I wanted to cry honestly.

Yes it's pretty TMI but honestly people should be aware of this in general because it happens to many women and men also have pelvic floor muscles. Everyone has that ""boat."" Men have that hole in the anus.

Anyway it took a lot of tears, time, reaching out, and researching to find out. A kind user told me I may have been dealing with pelvic hypertension, which led me to looking and concluding with my symptoms.

I've been following along on youtube to do pelvic floor exercises and it's been helping me a bit and reassuring me that I can reverse it. I'm honestly looking into shelling out $425 or something for Pelvic floor therapy sessions, but I need a proper diagnosis first.

My doctor has been... terribly disappointing. No help at all, he just prescribes while I did all the work looking around for help.

Anyway other than that life would be good. I love fangirling and talking to friends online. Wish I can go back to just worrying about social issues lol"

We didn't study anything all that new or exciting in either class. I think I had a rough day with bad thoughts and stuff that day, pretty sure. The evening was fine though. I studied a bit for my exam that I had today, had dinner with my grandma, and talked to Her for a bit. That's about all.

Today was pretty good. I woke up in a really good mood feeling positive about Her and I for some reason (like, overall positive, it felt nice!) I gave myself anxiety throughout the day in terms of worrying about specific people in my classes because I was friendly and talked with people today. I just have to watch myself and know that nothing will happen because I won't put myself into any potentially bad situations, not that I think that is likely to happen now or anything. Deeeep calming breaths. I came home though and went to an Escape Room with Her and two of Her brothers which was a lot of fun and we also played a card game after that I enjoyed a lot.

When I started high school, I was just my sisters little brother. Lived in her shadow, for a little bit until I found what I was good at. Reading girls feelings. I haven‚Äôt hit puberty yet so I was about 5‚Äô3 maybe 120lbs. Wore very big clothing and thought I was a ‚Äúgangster‚Äù. That same year I started boxing and my confidence grew exponentially! With my ‚Äúability‚Äù I made a lot of friends that were girls. Also with being my sisters little brother met a lot of guys that turned out to be life long friends. First year of high school was mostly making friends and refining my ability to read feeling. Got pretty good at it. Summer of that year I went to the beach and partied a lot losing my virginity and starting to have many girlfriends in different places. Sophomore year came around and I was hot! Hit puberty now 5‚Äô10 boxing put some weight on 160lbs and I was a killer. Every girl in high school would die for me, and I knew this and used it to my advantage. Got a ‚Äúserious‚Äù girlfriend at the beginning of the school year, call her Y, but every week I would cheat on her with any girl that I felt had any sort of attraction towards me. But I was still not the biggest player in school. I wasn‚Äôt even really known yet. School ended, finally ended it with the ‚Äúserious‚Äù girlfriend and did the same thing this summer. Partied, sex and beach. Lots of it, but now it was with older girls. Junior year came along and I was even hotter than before! I got an under the table job and had money to spend on clothes. Body didn‚Äôt change much because I had to remain in the same weight for boxing but regardless I was on fire! This year was my year! I made my name known to everyone in school. Everyone knew who I was. Everyone know I was the party guy, the fighter, the class clown, and most importantly the player. At the beginning of the year my sister dropped out and no longer was I her little brother. I made my own name! So much sex. So many parties and fights. This was the year all the freshmen‚Äôs had to go through me to be ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù. Seniors would envy me or admire me. I was king of the world. But some bad news, I failed 1 class and I had to take it next year to be able to graduate on time. Summer came along. Once again sex, parties, beaches and new to the rotation bowling alley. The bowling alley started to be a new hang out spot. We didn‚Äôt have to pay for anything because one of the guys worked there. It was a blast! Senior year came along and I was starting to self reflect on everything. Started being scared to fight, to catch an STD or fail high school. But I pushed all that to the back of my head. Continued doing what I did best. Messing with people‚Äôs feelings. Had a couple girlfriends but everyone was getting tired of me playing them. They caught on to my actions. Teachers would try to keep me away from girls. Still had the freshmen‚Äôs so I was ok with it, but the new freshmen guys weren‚Äôt. A lot of fighting, had to let them know who they were messing with. Around Christmas, 2 of my closes friends got into really serious relationships and I was doing the playing by my self. It was no longer fun to play girl, party or go the bowling alley by my self. So I focused on my classes and by this point I had already failed 3 more classes, I had a lot of catching up to do. Sometime between January and March I met the love of my life ‚ÄúJ‚Äù (no names). Absolute goddess in my eyes. But! She knew my history and didn‚Äôt give me the time of day. Needless to say I always end up with who I want. We started dating in May and we had a perfect relationship. School ended, didn‚Äôt catch up on classes so I dropped out, parties were once again fun with all my friends and her friends getting along. Same with the beach. Friend got fired from the bowling alley so no more of that. That summer I got an actual job and got J whatever she wanted with my 300$ a week. In August I give her a promise ring and promised never to fail her, which I didn‚Äôt...for about a year. Worked all the way to December till she sat me down and convinced me to finish school. Which I did. But from December till June, when I graduated, we were rocky. I never had a phone till I started school that year. Social media is a hell of a drug. I wanted to keep away from it because I knew what I would do if i had it. But once we got rocky I signed up for all the social media‚Äôs. Went on a flirting streak with anyone and i was back at it. Cheating after cheating after cheating. Even tho i was on top of the world with J, the feeling of having multiple women made my current top no longer the highest. We ended up breaking up, big surprise. From then on I worked a lot, focused most of my energy into boxing with the occasional side girlfriend. Did that for about 2 years and then joined the military. Met the perfect girl. Even more perfect than J. We had everything under control and i didn‚Äôt see how anything could go wrong, let‚Äôs call her B. Left all social media, for reasons stated above. Loved her unconditionally for 3 years! Not ever patting an eye towards other women. Then... my sister give my number to an old fling. She texted me, let‚Äôs call her D. We texted here and there. I wasn‚Äôt putting no effort into it. Didn‚Äôt really care for her. I was just being cordial. Then me and B started having issues, distance, i worked horrible hours and couldn‚Äôt talk to her for days sometimes, I would close off and not tell her how I truly felt. But D was always there and always flirting which filled my ego. On thanksgiving I broke up with the most perfect girl in the world for a chance to get D...
Never got D and never got my B back. Now 3 years later, I‚Äôm still wonderful at reading people‚Äôs feelings, always the life of the party, love the beach and if I get bored enough I‚Äôll have a side chick.
You remember how I said I pushed reflecting on my actions to the back of my head. Well! Years later it hit me like a meteor. I‚Äôm a little older now mid 20s. Reflecting on everything I‚Äôve done. I like to tell my self I don‚Äôt regret anything but that‚Äôs a lie to a certain extend. I regret breaking Y‚Äôs heart, she‚Äôs happily married and with kids. I regret breaking J‚Äôs heart and I also feel like I broke her more than anyone. She‚Äôs currently taking care of a no body boyfriend and has a kid by him. Living pay check to pay check (Forgot to mention she was a straight A student before we broke up). But my biggest regret will always be breaking up with B. She was the one. She was the one that I was gonna spend the rest of my life with. She was made for me.
I see all the people I used to hang out with or the girls that I used to play. Most have happy and full filling lives. While I‚Äôm forgotten and no longer on top of the world. This ‚Äúability‚Äù to read emotions was a blessing and a curse. Maybe I could‚Äôve used it in a more positive way but I didn‚Äôt and I kinda regret it.
The reason I say ‚Äúkinda regret it‚Äù is because if I didn‚Äôt do any of those things I wouldn‚Äôt be the man I am today. I care for others emotions now, I use my fighting abilities to teach others to defend them selfs and I‚Äôm always the life of the party.

For ever now I haven‚Äôt had a good voice, it cracks, it‚Äôs off tune, it‚Äôs shaken, it‚Äôs non melodic, I hate hearing the way I sound, I hate hearing my voice when I speak in general. But. I really wished I had that melody in soul, that tune that allowed someone to enjoy what I sang. I wish I could just sit there and sing to those I care about, I wish I could sing and evoke some emotion rather than disgust or cringe. I wish I was capable of having that harmonious sound when I open my mouth to emit my emotions, my feelings, my thoughts through a nice decent song at least, I wish I could sing so that the only thing that I have for when I lose my sight, or have arthritis, or just in bad luck to sing something and enjoy that little moment. To be able to sing is something I wish I had, I wish those who can will continue even if it‚Äôs in their car, on a bus, or at work just doing the routine, I‚Äôm jealous of those people, I really am.

Pretty good day! I had some issues in the morning but feeling better now. I worked, studied, took an exam, and studied more. That's pretty much my whole day! I didn't do anything fun that I remember.

It kind of represents my yearn for the freedom for childhood again and my own children. I want to add little stars and such to kind of represents one of those mobiles that you hang over a baby's crib.

Morning - starting at internship, very interesting. Not used to this freedom.

Evening - meeting with the party commission. The start of the meeting went shaky, people came late, and no big steps were made. Later the meeting took a positive turn and everybody chipped in. I felt the energy in myself, and hoped other would pick on it. Was a real good meeting. Good ideas. Huge.

EMBITTERED OR JUST NOT INTERESTED
-
Girls, my biggest weakness. Always fall in love too fast. But lately I've been having the opposite, not interested at all. I'm not sure why the sudden change. Perhaps it's because of previous attempts and my brain finally realising it isn't worth the energy.

Both my housemates fell in love with the same girl. And another dude in the friends group as well. Usually I would be part of this group. But I am happy I'm not. Feels like I've got a better grip on my emotions.

Saturday - making music with Jisse our new song is come as you are of nirvana and afraid of heights of Billy talent.

Had some beers in the evening with Jop and Irwin they wanted to go out and I refused because I was tired and honestly just wanted to play fallout 2, which I finished so now I don't really have much to do.

Sunday - had some beers in the evening with Ilse.

She is a girl I just don't understand, well she is easy to understand on the surface, bit shy but happy. But what does she really think? Well maybe it could be that I am a retard and don't know how to read such things. But I know I feel this way for a reason, I've evidence build up.

CASE A: THE AMERICAN MESSAGE
Back when I was on the continent America we messaged eachother a lot, even a bit more spicy things. To clarify with spicy I actually mean quite bland spicyness, but for me spicy nonetheless. Things like sharing a bed because she is scared. Or how she missed me and how we shared pictures of our vacation.

CASE B: GETTING MARRIED
OK, easy one to crack this one. She mentioned how we should get married when both of us don't have anybody when we get 30 years old. Yeah, I know this is kinda like in how I've met your mother but hopefully this gets a better finale.

CASE C: SAY WHAT YOU MEAN, DONT JUST COME KNOCKING
At our latest party she was also there. I invited her to come and eat with us. When we went to the store she stayed with the others. At the party she spend most of her time with the others. I stayed in my room with my friends while the others were partying in the living room. While I was in my room she entered multiple times, just to say: ""wow, the party is so fun it is so crazy, you should see it.""
Ok, thanks for the info I am enjoying myself over here. Or did you mean you wanted that I come and join you?

CASE D: THE CASE OF BEER
Every evening we spent drinking she has a tendency to spent most of her times with the others but suddenly visit me, telling me how greats it is with the others and leaves. In the club when she gets disturbed she comes to me.

When I went for beers with her I leaned against her with my head while we watched TV. Eventually I took her hand and put it over me (I like being the small spoon). I said: ""this is much more comfortable"". While she nervously replied: ""uhh, ok""

CONCLUSION: no
She doesn't say what she want, that is clear. But maybe I should say what I want. But my biggest fear is that I like her, not exactly because I like her but because I want to be liked. Getting a girlfriend so you can have that title.

I like what she is, fun, driven. I dislike her unwillingness to tell what she really wants, her uncertainty.

I've written about her quite often, but now I feel like I've reached a point, continue or cancel her. Be more or be nothing. And for my own sanity I've chosen to be nothing. Case closed."

I've been dreaming of my ex boyfriend quite often lately. I hate it because I can't avoid thinking about him the next day. I know why I ended things but I worry that the older I get, the smaller my pool of eligible suitors. The older we get the more baggage we tend to have. I'm not sure I'm gathering more baggage, but I also don't know how much baggage I want to deal with in dating someone in the future. I have very supportive friends who don't want me to ""settle"" but sometimes I wonder how much you can expect from a potential partner. Life is hard. I'm throwing my pity party tonight.

So regarding the strategy I proposed in my last post.  I am currently deep in the main flaw in that strategy.  I have been struck by melancholy, and I am in the early part of a day with nothing to do.  Well no committments anyway.  The lawn should be mowed.  Weeds sprayed.  Leaking roof investigated.  But there's no immediate consequences to not doing those things.

So I'm going to get some McDonald's now.  And go and play the strategy video game I'm currently addicted to.  And just hope for my life to change.

I just feel sorry for my dog, that's she's stuck with a loser such as me.

Depression boredom and lack of sleep are a bad mix. Well maybe not a lack of sleep but tiredness. The real deal breaker for me was having tattoo needles and ink.

So like over the last week I did a few stick n poke tattoos (what some call machineless tattooing) but today I tried to do something on a spot I love the most and I am kinda freaking out. It was a bad idea and with tattoos you can't really erase them that easily.

My reasoning and thinking behind it was ""self harm and tattoos are vaguely similar in that they both cause pain and leave permanent marks or scars."" So if I tattoo myself at least it'll look pretty.

Honestly not the worst idea but I'm slowly worried and freaking out. I might hate it and that's my worst fear.

0,"A post to move on from one day
Never thought I would see myself writing this, but I was told it would be therapeutic to do so - so here goes nothing.

Its nearly a month from my 31st birthday and this year, I am back to being alone. The worst part of it all - I am the reason for where I am now. There are so many songs about turning back time, and yet, all I am able to do is re-live it all in my head as it happened. People always say they would like to fly or see through walls if they were granted a super power. Not this guy. Just let me turn back time once. Just once.

It all started in mid-2016. A girl was hired that was just a few rows over. But not just any girl. She was the real deal. Smart, charismatic, beautiful, and fun. So much so, I was fixated by the grander of it all. I found myself wanting to spend every second I could with her. We became close friends pretty quickly to the point where she began to open up to me about the problems she is going through - including her boyfriend at the time. Already early on, I knew I had developed feelings for her, but I did not want to get in the way of her relationship. So there I was, listening to it and hoping that I learn from everything that was bad so that maybe one day, if dreams do come true, I could be the boyfriend she needed.

Eventually, the two of them broke up and sooner or later, all those wishes directed at every star I could count worked. We became a couple. The next year that followed was the best year in my life. Before her, I never put myself out there to be in a serious relationship. And it wasn't that I didn't have the opportunity. I was also the type that never wanted to sleep with someone unless I truly loved them. This meant a lot to me, and I wanted to save myself the pain of being with a women only to eventually have them gone from your life.

Now here is the problem. All of your Hollywood movies make it seem like being a virgin is the worst thing ever. That no girl would want to be with a virgin. That they find the thought of it strange and that the man may have something wrong with them. In my case, I turned opportunities down because I was not ready. But who would believe that? So I lied. When asked what my past was like, I said I was with women before. She said the same and we moved on. However, this was the first time I ever lied to her. A lie that looking back on made absolutely no sense and could have helped out the relationship.

Another early issue was that I was advised to refrain from making relationships public at work. I've seen people get fired for it even though they weren't on the same team. The thought of having her get fired with the reasoning of her spending too much time with me would destroy me. I was concerned it could be used against her and I held my foot down as much as she wanted otherwise. I so wish I could do this over and open it up publicly and show everyone how lucky I am. And if people were negative, than maybe the workplace wasn't the right fit for either of us. But it should not have been an issue the way I made it be.

We continued to have a great relationship. We traveled, stayed local, shared so many common interests that everything was enjoyable. And then on one trip, another hiccup happened. A major blow. A few weeks before, my family sat me down and asked that I help my brother with dating apps. He was reluctant to download them, so I did on my phone to show the family how simple it is for him to find someone to date. I showed them a comparison of apps and swiped left and right carelessly to show how they function. I never had the intent to use them for myself. Not when I had the best girl right in front of me. One that no girl can compare to. So on one app, I never messaged anyone ever. But then, my idiot self did something only a true moron would. While in pretty bad stomach pains sitting on the toilet, I had a notification of a chat. So I sent a message back as a distraction. I had my girlfriend there at the time with me in the room nearby, but I am a pretty closed off person and don't like having people worry. So I chatted for a minute with this person I have 0 care for and that was that. Well, turns out, another notification kicked in and the girlfriend noticed. She confronted me on the matter, as anyone should be, and the truth was so farfetched, that she did not believe me. Fair to say, I would not believe me. I begged and begged her to trust me, to ask my parents about me downloading the apps and showing them what they are all about. She was hurt and devastated. But somehow, she found a way to still love me. To try and believe me. Even though in the back of her mind, she felt it was all a lie. She tried for me.

Fast forward to what would become the start of the greatest mistake in my life. A few weeks before thanksgiving, she would bring up how excited she was to share it with me and my family and that she has no means to celebrate with her family that year. Great! a girlfriend who truly wants to spend time with your family is what I have always wanted in my life. It meant the world to me. The problem? I had a demon that I never encountered before in my life. I found true love, love I wanted to extend to living with them for the rest of my life. But this love of mine came from a different faith. My faith is one where the entire religion rides on it being passed from the woman. A man can be of another faith, but the bloodline of the religion is passed down by the woman. Now, I am not a believer in religion at all and I consider myself agnostic. But I grew up with the notion that I have to be with a woman of the same faith. If that were not the case, my parents would never speak to me again. My entire family would cease to exist and I would have nothing. At least that is how i played it out not realizing that I would have something. I would have everything I ever wanted still there with me. My girlfriend.

Well, I panicked. I never loved someone and then I found love in a woman outside my faith. I started to pull away. And in doing so, I didn't invite her to thanksgiving. I was a wreck. I knew how much this would hurt her. And so I left my dinner early and made her a thanksgiving dinner just for the two of us that same night. But she knew something was not right. That what i just did was not normal. And I never told her the reason for that action at the time.

Ever since that incident, things became rocky. She wanted me to do more, to be what a boyfriend was supposed to be. And I just kept backing away further and further while trying to fight to hold on to her and balance out this demon that I hoped would eventually resolve itself. I was hoping that somehow I would find the courage to bring this up to the family. Share how much she meant to me and that no matter what decision they came to, I would side with her.

That never happened. Instead, I was confronted about it and I sided with the family. Biggest mistake in my life. This is the one, the one moment I would give anything to turn back and correct. This changed everything. We cried as I tried to say she will be ok. That she will move on and find another me. A better me that she deserves. And I caved in to the demon in my head.

Around this time, a new girl at work that lived nearby became friendly with me at a time where I needed a friend. I needed someone to talk to about all things not related to my girlfriend and the demon in me. I never had intentions to be with this girl or do anything romantically. It was therapy in a way where I didn't have many friends to help me out with. One night, she calls and says she doesn't have access to the house she was dogsitting at, and asked if she could come over. Not thinking anything of it or feeling the need to bring this up to the girlfriend (who at this time, we were mostly off in an on again off again relationship), i said sure. The night ended early as the following day was a Monday. Nothing happened and it was clear that nothing was going to happen between both of us.

Well, lesson learned. The girlfriend found out and doubted everything I said. She assumed we had something going on and she said enough is enough. Now, in these two years together, she had slept with friends (not romantically ... I think), at their place - with one being in another state entirely and not telling me about it until i found out. She reacted by saying I would never understand that they were just friends and that is why she wasn't honest with me at the time. Yet, when i brought up the same here, she felt it was a lie to her face. If only she knew how wrong she was. How I would never do such a thing after telling her in between this time, that I lied in the past about the women I was with. And that she indeed was the first.

All the above strikes cast such a cloud of doubt over her regarding me and my actions, that she had enough. We broke up for what seemed like for good. Yet things again took a turn for the worst. All of my actions took a heavy toll on her and she found herself seeking medical help. She was depressed. And I had no idea to the extent. And then one night, she called and told me she considered taking her life. Throwing it all away because we were no longer a couple. I was terrified. I wanted to be with her so so bad, and yet I could not kill the demon I had. So I didn't know what to do. I drove as fast as I could to her place to reassure her she would be ok and she will find someone. This seemed to help her. Although it crushed me like no other. I wanted to be there for her for the rest of her life. To never see her in that situation ever again. Yet even at this moment, I could not break out of my fear.

After this incident, there was one more. A call where she expressed if we are no longer going to be a couple, she will stop trying and move on for good. She went to the extent of saying she will sleep with someone right away if i said it was done. And if there was ever a time to say stay with me please, this would have been it. I failed. Like the many times before. I failed. Well, she did what she said she would do. She went out, and slept with a guy within the first week of the official breakup. Now this was not just some random guy. This was a man at our same workplace who she worked with. He was a Director who was twice her age. This man was going through a divorce and had a reputation of sleeping around with many women and using them. And in this case, he was doing the same to her. And seeing this, I was crushed. As I write this, I AM crushed. This is not past tense right now, but happening before my eyes. What was once my girlfriend whom I thought was reluctant to put herself out there, who saw being romantic with someone came with loving them, was just a lie. I found out she truly pushed herself on this guy (who knew the opportunity was there for the taking), and the deed happened. I can't accept that the girlfriend I was with for two years and love with every ounce in my body, threw herself at a guy twice her age and only a few years younger than her own father. And knowing as much as I do about the guy, I despise him for using her the way he is. Sure she might see it as her using him as well. But I would like to think that her state of mind is not healthy and she is being used. But the thought of that also bothers me. I thought she was stronger. I thought she saw things my way when it came to being intimate. I was wrong.

I don't know how to move on now. I lost my lover and my best friend due to my actions and she has found a way to move on and be intimate in a way I would never have imagined. I would not have been ok with any guy for that matter since I still loved her. But I would hide it and be supportive to the best of my abilities. But in the situation she is in, I am devastated. My young, beautiful, smart ex lover that I still love is hooking up with what could be her dad. I am not strong enough mentally to cope with this idea. All i do is visualize everything we did intimately, but he is doing it to her. And I was already super self conscious when it came to being intimate. The thought of an older man twice her age and twice her size making love to her, and doing it better than me, and having her love it, I am dead inside. I wish there was a way I can move on. But I am too emotional. I can not put myself out there the way she did. I need love, and my love is gone.

I hope one day, I can look back on this thread and find myself in a better place. A place where I will still recall the fondest memories in my life, but where I can at least be in a place of happiness. Right now, I just can't even get myself up in the mornings. Breaking up is one thing. Saying you want to break up when you really don't is another. Seeing the person you broke up with after not wanting to break up with them sleep with someone else so quickly and twice their age, I just don't have answers right now.

Worst of all, with the official break-up, i finally found strength to confront my family about the feelings I had for her. I told them I would be willing to no longer see them for the rest of my life if they were not comfortable with the thought of me and her (if time could be turned). And after talking it out, they agreed love trumps their own beliefs on faith and that they would just want me happy even if they are not comfortable with the differing religions. So after everything was said and done, and she slept with someone so quickly, I got the ok to love her forever. Great timing life. Thanks!

I wish she doesn't get hurt. I wish her all the best. I wish she was still the girl I knew and the girl that just held back a little longer to where I can be where I am at now. Accepting and fear-free. I won't ever have that chance again. But maybe if I try wishing on stars again, the way this all started, maybe time will go back for me. If only...

To now and future self - Be strong. Find a way to accept what happened. And make yourself smile. You owe yourself at a minimum a smile.

I'm posting early but this my energy is gone and I need rest even if I resent and hate myself for it.


I don't even know. I'm more stable vertically not sad not extremely happy but I'm off kilter, side ways.  Anyway something makes me want to self harm today. Maybe I miss the feeling. Maybe it's something, nothing or it's probably a sign of... Idk, a symptom. I just don't know the cause.

Also today is the first time I took out my tools and looked at them.  I use to do that a while ago and just wait for the moment. It was like I was waiting for something to tell me do it.

Sleepiness is getting to me now but I can't decide if I want to start self harming again and go futher down the road or be known as I currently am. A sad depressed good for nothing lazy individual.


Oh final note I can't remember if I mentioned it but I asked master chi (obvious fake name lol) if he was scared I'd end up in hospital. He's mentioned it before a few times when I've disappeared for a weekend but I never knew if it was serious.

Apparently he was... He's scared I'll end up somewhere far less happier. "

So it seems I'm in a lot better headspace then I was yesterday. I'm more calmer and at ease and have decided the place I once called home, I'll never set foot in again. If it comes to it I'll sleep in the park and be homeless for a few nights. That place is no longer welcoming to me. I should have realized the moment I stepped into it last weekend but...

I know it doesn't make any sense but I'm leaving a lot out.  As for my urges they are still there but a lot less powerful now. I still have an urge to destroy my arm and end up in hospital but it's manageable now. However if I do I'm blaming him just for the lols and a huge fuck you ;)

Also I spent most of today trying to catch up on rest as I think I slipped my antidepressants yesterday and didn't sleep for a day or 2. That probably helped a lot. "

Why the long break?
I've been trying to write all my logs in my book. But a lack of motivation slows me. I still only have written a few pages. I need to make a concise choice. Stick with the book or go digital.

Second reason. I've become embittered. A lack of success and stress made me like this. Unable to love the same way I did before, because others don't share the same feelings with me.

INTERNSHIP
-
At the begin of the month things weren't looking up. My friends and colleagues all got work and I was sleeping on the couch at school. Until I started to call companies from a exstudents list. I had a good call. Spoke about 11 minutes with the man, he would try to create a project for me. Later a teacher came up to me with an internship at a company that designs a home use beerstill. It's a startup company. I was invited for a meeting at both. And both were a success. I just didn't know which one of the company's to choose. Different wages and different work. I've got to be honest my choice was based on how much I make, 300 euros or 500 euros is a big difference. And making a little beer brewery is more fun, and working more directly with a team is more interesting.

Yeah, one of our famed parties. Always a absolute mess, and everybody is wasted. I invited my close friends with whom I mostly spent time with. They left home early. Wesley invited a few friends of his own. They joined us in my living room while in the kitchen and living room and hall people were ""partying"". Of course you might wonder why I but that in quotations, it's because if that is called partying I find it fucking moronic. Throwing food and screaming in a cramped space is not my cup of tea. I love a good party but people too wasted and with too little respect for the house piss me off. What is this the first time you drank alcohol? Why can't they control themselves? The entire home was a mess, and the smell was worse. I spoke with a few people who weren't absolutely wasted, they didn't really seem to enjoy it themself. When you wear a good looking dress you don't want to put it close to filth.

So yeah, I decided to spent my time in my room with 3 others. I don't want a mess in my room and the others were on a different vibe. We ended up going out. It was crowded. Almost got in a fight in the first club. Later we went to a club, and people were walking around with balloons and sucking on them. Ah gas. I wanted to try and so I did. Bought the XL balloon and took some good hits. Damn that feeling, so short but definitely hard. It's like Thomas said, like the moment gets repeated a 1000x. Wesley also did it but he went harder than I did and fell on a guy. After that we left, didn't really feel welcome, weird types.

The rest of the night was still crowded but we went on danced had some beers and smokes. It was fun but nothing special. At the end of the night I linked up with the group of the party, but most of them were so tired, I was almost the only one who danced. I left with Ilse and others. I am glad she is my friend, but spending time with her and getting more physical is making me question our relation, do I want more than this? We have been talking a lot lately also about very personal things. Despite that I know we have some conflicting interesses. She loves Dutch music and volk culture and I hate it. She is a goody two shoes and I make mistakes. Meh, I'll see."

Heeeyyyy, getting close to 700. Alright, today was real bad. I didn't study enough and had a real hard time with bad thoughts. I have a lot of tests next week and feel like I am having a bit of a hard time getting motivation to do work the past few days and that really stinks. I need to knock it out of the park in terms of productivity in the next few days so that I am ready for all of my big tests that I will be taking next week. That's all for now I guess. I am going to study a bit more and then catch some z's."

I'm here and my tools are on the desk next to me. But my energy has dropped to basically nothing. All I want to do is lay here and curl up in a ball, forgetting about everything.


I ended up making a lot of my posts on FB hidden and blocking all my family members (there were only 3 left. Brother, sister in law and sister.) I may regret it in the near future but for right now I needed to do it.

I'm finally stable again. A lot more stable then I was this morning. I'm still scared I'll wake up and hurt myself, end up taking the painkillers or both. I'm scared they'll talk to me about what happened during the call they didn't want me to know about. I'm scared they'll confront me and it'll make things much worse then they were today. But right now I'm just tired of everything. I'm tired of the world and all it's people.

I'm going to try sleep it away but I'm happy I'm stable. My baseline mood has dropped to about 3 or 4 out of 10 but I'm stable and that's the main thing. "

I don‚Äôt know how I feel about him anymore. It feels like the initial attraction is mildly wearing off but not enough for me to lose interest at all. That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I‚Äôm more lost than ever after the last time I saw him. Everything went well. I had an amazing time, he said he did too even after the fact in a text later after we went our separate ways. But something feels off... I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it either which is really what‚Äôs bothering me. He always seems so down to make plans with me but never overnight or at either of our places and never on the weekends even though I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs got the time off work. And even when I offer a solid plan to accommodate us both better he finds a reason not to do that and gives a half assed explanation for said reason. Even if he‚Äôs being honest, I just wish I‚Äôd get a better explanation because I‚Äôm so fucking confused.

I‚Äôm afraid if I try to have a more serious discussion about our visits it‚Äôs going to come off like I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äúput a label on us‚Äù or ‚Äúget serious‚Äù which, yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt mind. But I‚Äôm not trying to do that and I‚Äôm not sure how to convey it so it doesn‚Äôt come off that way.

He turns me into something I don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm not with him. At least the few days immediately following a visit. The lead up to see him again is fine too. It‚Äôs so weird. I always get my hopes up but I don‚Äôt really tell him what I want and then I get upset (not with him) when things don‚Äôt play out ‚Äúright‚Äù and I realize that‚Äôs my biggest issue but I feel like it‚Äôs just way too soon to lay it all out like that. The last time I tried to do something of the sort it all went sour and he misunderstood and went the complete opposite direction of what I meant. I feel like these are all discussions that should be had in person but I never know how to broach the subject. God, it feels like I‚Äôm getting such mixed signals and I have no idea how to interpret them. All I‚Äôm getting out of this is that I don‚Äôt fucking understand the dating world.

I know mom said to focus on ‚Äújust being friends first‚Äù and I‚Äôm genuinely trying to be okay with this weird nsa fwb dynamic we‚Äôve got going on but I‚Äôm not sure that I am and it‚Äôs kind of killing me not knowing if he wants or would ever want more from me. I know J wasn‚Äôt the one for me and I know I wasn‚Äôt happy with him and it only would‚Äôve gotten worse over time but I kind of regret ending things with him. I liked the familiarity and the comfort of him. Maybe I am just a chronic over thinker and all my problems are in my head.

Honestly I partially wish it wouldn‚Äôt work out, sooner rather than later, because T is still in the picture and I do like him. And I know for a fact that he likes me and would treat me really really well but he‚Äôs so far away and I know he won‚Äôt come here any time soon. If I could at least see him to see how the in person chemistry goes I may be able to make up my mind a little easier but instead I‚Äôm stuck with two mostly seemingly perfect individuals each with their relatively major flaw and I just cannot pick who‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.

I wish life had a hint button I could press that would point me in the right direction or just flat out tell me the answer to one of my biggest questions, I‚Äôd even take a question limit like one hint/answer every 3 years or something. Fuck.

Sometimes it feels like he really does like me, other times I get this weird gut feeling that all he wants is sex, and other times yet I feel like he likes having me around as a friend who‚Äôs available for sex but it isn‚Äôt necessary. I‚Äôm not even sure what I want from this situation anymore. The more I think about it the more confused I get. But he does make me feel better about my body, which is a huge blessing quite frankly. God that man got under my skin so so so easily. I hate it. I hate that this is what my life revolves around now. "

We all have that little voice inside us, the one that whispers to you late at night mocking your darkest and deepest insecurities.

Well I've spent the past 12 days battling an ever increasing urge to watch my arm bleed then burn it to hell. I'm kind of happy and sad to say that I'm ""clean"" whatever the fuck that means. Sometimes it's a good thing other times I wonder if it means I'm just too weak to cut.

Anywho this morning I read something that wasn't meant for me but was about me. You know the kind of things that little voice tells you about. Tells you how others think of you and such well... It sucks to have those confirmed.

I read in someones own writing that the lowest I think of myself is what they think of me. HOW FUN! RIGHT!!!  The things they said... It hurt. Hearing it from someone who is family but who thinks you're a waste of space. It's exactly what I wabted.

This has pushed me to my limits. I want so badly to disappear into nothing.  Run away into the safety of the burning flame and let the sharp Razer kiss my skin once again. I have about 1 hour maybe 2 left before I can finally reach my tools. I'm going to hope that I end up disappearing into the dark comfort of sleep and skip food till next week I guess.

I'll update once I get there and let nobody know if I self harm or not.

the last couple of days been rough emotionally. dealing with attitudes at work and being talked to harshly bothers me greatly.  i know i shouldn‚Äôt let it bother me but it does. today my aunt had a serious talk with me about taking sleep pills saying they can be very addictive and that she doesn‚Äôt want to ever find me dead. i know she means well but it hurts and i ended up staying in my room til nightfall.  part of me feel ok and happy because of the antidepressants but as im writing my feelings are shattered. im scared to face her now because she can be like a broken record and wont let shit go. she is also the reason for my depression. she can be so controlling to where i feel like im in prison rather than home. sometimes i contemplate suicide but i just push through by staying in my fantasy world.  thats all i can do to take my mind off of things.

Me: male in my 40s.  Tradesman. Living in a major Australian city.

I'm trying this journal as a strategy for coping with my depression.  Yesterday and today have been relatively good days.  Last week was really bad

A thought I had today, is that when I have good moods I'm just going to stick to my normal work and free-time routine.  Enjoy the little things, but not try and go chasing huge highs

And when I get low moods, I'm going to try and just put my head down, and plod though my normal routine.  Try not to dwell on my thoughts.  Just keep busy

In my current mind state that seems doable.  When I'm in the grip of a low mood I suspect that will change

So a little about myself.  I like playing strategy video games, like Distant Worlds and Civilization.   I like tv shows like Ozark, GoT, Suits, Westworld.   Im not in a committed relationship at the moment.  But there are a few ladies that I catch up with on a semi regular basis.

I will try and update regularly.  Thanks for reading

I didn't have many friends.  If you think you could be a friend, especially IRL, I'd really like you to contact me.  Thanks.

I‚Äôm reading this thing on how to start to handle your anger. Part of the solution is finding the root of your anger.
How fucking stupid is that?
What if every single thing that has ever fucking happened to you is what makes you so fucking angry? Then what are you supposed to do?
What if you have seven therapists tell you over a span of 8 years that you are completely healthy with no anger issues, just to come home to a bunch of broken appliances nonworking remotes. A shattered cell phone. A fractured wrist from missing my punching bag. A cracked computer monitor.
But also just this fucking fire that never stops in my chest and my stomach. I just want to hit things. I just wanna hit someone. I just want to make someone feel the way that they all made me feel.
I promise I am better than that though. These are just the things that I can‚Äôt control feeling and I really wish I could.
I‚Äôm ashamed of how angry I am.
I used to be so broken and so sad.
Now I just feel hate.
And I just feel him.
I just feel the other him.
And the other him.
I just want to scream at the top of my lungs and never stop.
You all thought you created this broken person that would end up taking her life never really thinking that they would survive this long and grow to fucking hate you and hate everything about themselves too.
But now I‚Äôm not even broken anymore. I don‚Äôt even know how to feel that anymore. I just hate. I am just mad. The stupidest shit makes me lose my goddamn mind anymore.
I feel crazy. Every day people always make me feel crazy. My friends and family do. They think just because I have this anger inside me that I‚Äôm a monster. But I‚Äôm really not a monster I just can‚Äôt control it anymore. I just want to break things I just want to break myself I wanna break my bones
How am I am I in love with someone who is such an opposite of me? He has optimism. He has peace inside of him. He knows joy. I am slowly ruining this person. I tried to warn him when we first got together that he really didn‚Äôt want to get tangled with someone like me.
Why couldn‚Äôt he have listened? You‚Äôre just too good. "

I have been putting that off but it would be so useful if i could get one. I tried playing some Overwatch a bit today and that started off well but got worse as a played more.

It's not like I don't want to talk to you. I just don't know what to say to you. I kinda got tired of talking the same conversation as before. I tried to be a did listener but it's hard. So much resentment inside of me that I'm unable to let myself breath. How did this happen? Was it my fault or what?

I'm trying to get better at our relationship but it's sort of exhausting. After living here for less than 3 years, I'm emotionally drained. I'm going out more to avoid your daily tantrum of work. I tried to listen but it's frustrating when you talk in circles when the solution is right in front of you.

I've helped you out in the past and all I've gotten was disrespect in return. Why am I trying so hard to mend this but it's just getting pushed back?

**I. Don't. Know.**

I just hate this constant feeling of anxiety when I'm around you and it's because I don't feel safe here. I tried to cope with the situation but it's hard. It's fucking tiring!!

I'm just tired of this shit. Why can't things just start over? If I could press rewind, so I can edit a specific spot in time, I would in a heartbeat.

Yesterday when I awoke - there was a strange stillness in the air. An eerie senses of calm was over me. Me? Calm? Never. I should have known something was up. The day felt hued in grays. Looked at my phone while still in bed. A google card about vultures profile on Mac Miller. I read through it. Absorbing. Empathizing. I was hopeful. Things were ok.


I moved slow. Thought out every movement. I felt very aware. Very present. Very still. I ignored my phone. I didn‚Äôt want to speak to anyone. Or get caught up in the fast pace of messages, phone calls, the internet. It was too much. Too fast. And I was feeling, slow.


I made a smoothie. Had my vitamins. Cleaned the house. Walked the dogs. All so quiet. Calm. Even the dogs felt it. I know.


Went to put on some music. Had been listening to swimming non stop, but for some reason, it wasn‚Äôt right. The moment was off. I turned on a slow Beatles playlist. Slow. Soft. Dreamy. Romantic. I sat down. Breathed. Felt my presence in this world. Felt very aware of my existence. It was very unusual.


When I saw the notification, I just felt, pain. Slow, silent, grief. Unbelievable. It couldn‚Äôt be true. Someone who held a vital part of my existence in his hands. Gone.


The rest of my day was on autopilot.


I remember at one point in the evening. Going into my room to pray. When was the last time I prayed? It‚Äôs been years. I prayed with no dialogue. No words. Only feelings. Pain. I prayed for his mother. For his family. For the future that would not include him. For his soul, his smile, his light. I wept. Because I felt, he had so much more to give. So much more to live.


As I lay in bed last night, I reflected on the events of the day. Had my spirit known? Was my spirit silently mourning him without me even knowing yet? Was the universe around me shifting because it knew. When it was happening. Everything is connected. Everyone. My world knew, something was wrong. Something was different. Something was happening. My spirit was already in mourning. Everything was different. And the world knew.

These are posts for Wednesday and Thursday! Wednesday was my first day back to school. I wasn't too nervous about it and it went well overall. I really like that I have all of my classes in one building, makes it really easy not to get lost. I had some anxiety and worried/bad thoughts about Her and I that day and Thursday. Just being around people my age and far from home didn't help I guess. I feel alright now though, I think. Classes went well though. The first one seems more physics based than I expected and the other one that day is all about research methods which I am not really that worried about. I went and stayed with my grandma that night which was nice and got to see my aunt and my nephew that I really haven't seen enough of. The next day was the long day. Had classes for like 6ish hours. I didn't end up eating the second sandwich that I packed for the day just because I didn't feel like eating it, even though I ate only a little throughout the day. I found someone else in one of my classes that went to the same school as me, same major, and same minor. What are the odds? The world is weird. I was a bit agitated when I got home with Her for a dumb reason but She told me that She was having a bad day and that helped tbh. I work tonight and don't want to bleh. Alright, that's all for now.

""She puts the weights in my little heart.""

Morning - Little work at school, preparing meeting for tonight. Made some calls and e-mails.

Midday - Volunteering work in the kitchen, quite fun. Had to lead the kitchen which was fun but exhausting.

Evening - Commision meeting. Was a bit chaotic but good fun. Afterwards we went to my room and had more beers. at 00:00 we celebrated the birthday of Irene.

Yeah, dumbshit reporting. Ready for misery. Falling in love again at the first touch. Falling on my face on the first disappointment.  This time touch and physical affection is my poison.

I saw how she massaged my housemate, I'll admit the jealousy became too much. I saw how she looked at him. How can I blame them? I needed time for myself. I went in my room and looked at old pictures of my mom. I talked to my mom in the pictures. Same moment she came in. She sat next to me and gave me a long hug. But all I could feel was disappointment.

Midday - visited my mentor at school. Conclusion, i'm pretty boned with my internship, I have to find something now or settle with what I have. Spending the rest of my midday chilling and arranging an event for 27 september. I did spent some good time with Irene.

Evening -  cooking for Jisse's family. Made mole con pollo with advice from my aunt. It was a good succes! Afterwards spent some time talking with jisse, always good stuff.

Yeah I felt down. No upside down frown. Laid down on the couch no motivation at all. And then she came. I saw her before and asked if she wanted to join me, she said she wanted to work in a more secluded area, but there she was. She sat next to me and touched my hair while I told my troubles. Of course like previously Mark came in, in a bad moment. Despite that we continued sort of cuddling which I enjoyed. It lasted long. She read my diary, noting multiple times that she found it very personal. I said it was no biggy. She even read 19 december - 25 december. The time when I had a thing for Maud, she noted how she found it quite sad in a laughing manner. She went to most of all pages, and she put her fingers on the pages and felt the drawings. Each page she read she put her fingers on it, and while laying with my head on her side, I followed her movements with my eyes as her fingers slides around.

Like i've written before, I am not sure if she is just really friendly or actually likes me? Despite that, all in all. I don't know her really much, so before I do anything I want to get to know her better. Perhaps invite her to do something with me. At least so far i've always enjoyed her company, and I love getting mushy, but before she becomes ""girlfriend material"" I want to get to know her better. But I must not forget to focus on myself, I want to stick to my school plan and not get delayed. If she truly likes me well find a way.

Overal, pretty good day. Not very effective but I re-found my motivation, for girls and for my internship. Have some good leads i'm going to follow tomorrow. Overal 8/10."

i never post much in my diary due to laziness.my laziness and procrastination will be my downfall in life. i just know it. without getting to deep, ill try to skim it. my depression was put in remission thanks to my antidepressants i started taking last month. it helped me feel fine until yesterday when a coworker was talking shit about me saying that i was bland and boring. that hurted and it hurts more since he is the same asshole that gives me a hard time. i hate working with him. that made me slip back into my depression. waking up was rough because i woke up at 7 am to feed the dog and then i went back to sleep. when i woke up my brother was in the shower so i did a quick wash downstairs. he got done with the shower and grilled me about Turning the water on while he was in the shower. it made me more upset because he been a real douchebag lately and im taking it personal. he makes me feel like im the bad guy sometimes and i hate when he talks to me like im a 2 year old. i went to work later on and did my 4 hour shift. work was ok which is what im going to leave it at. when i got off i stopped by a store and bought another cellphone to use with safelink. i know i didnt need it but it was on clearance for $20 and just wanted it. i got some pizza and saw 2 hot guys in suits that was making me drool. i want to write more but im too lazy and take things for granted."

Alright, time for another post! Today was short. I slept like trash last night and am not sure why. I don't think that I will sleep very well tonight because I will be nervous about school. Tomorrow is the first day! I think that I've done everything that I need to do to prepare (but idk what I am doing so who really knows). I am worried about my classes being too hard, the area being a little bit dangerous, the long commute, and being away from Her. Whew. It's a lot on my plate. Speaking of. Her and I made dinner tonight and it turned out pretty decent I think! I made lemon garlic chicken and She made a cauliflower mash thing. I worked today, one hour more than I thought I would which is exciting because I need all the money I can get. Her and I are trying to do some budgeting stuff and it's difficult. Alright, that's all for now. I will get through this and will be done with school and onto a career before I know it, right? "

Hey all! Today was a good day! As usual i went to college and then i came back. I learnt today how mridangam was made. I was glad to know about it since it has never seemed complicated. And... i ate with all my friends at college which is a good thing. I practiced Rubik's cube today with proper concentration. I definitely understood what was a ""proper look ahead"". Happy to have understood it. Book reading has been a thing this year. But it has been so laggy with lots of gaps. So i already feel i am developing good habits, not that i had bad habits, but i refer the unnecessary habits like texting and scrolling insta feed and stuff. And i posted another 2 parts of the video i received yesterday on my YouTube channel. I think that is all for today. Bye!"

When am I meant to have a single spare moment? To grade or to do laundry? When? I haven't graded a single thing since school started. It's just piling into a huge stack.

This morning my husband dropped my baby off at daycare. He told me the teacher said that his nails are too long. Poor little guy. He wants to play with the other babies and be social but they can't let him because he might scratch them.

I started crying when my husband told me this.

I am losing my grip on things.

Time for a post! Today was Her and I's anniversary! We didn't really do anything special for it :p Whew I feel tired. We did cook a dinner together though which is pretty cool I would say. I don't really know what I did all day. I had some worried thoughts and stuff earlier in the day but feel pretty ok now I would say. I might try and do some real quick exercise thingys right now before I go to bed. I don't think it's advisable to exercise right before bed, but I'm not too worried about it to be honest. Man, it's hot in here. Alright, that's all for now. School starts toooooo soon."

0,"3 September 2018 - ""Internships and the Dentist""
""Yeah rub it in my face, what you have I apparently don't deserve, thought I did my best, my reward is to wait ""

.

Morning - visiting workplace for internship, greenlight but not exactly what I wanted. Visiting dentist, went to the wrong one at first, called and said i'd be there in 15 min, kind people.

Midday - going to school to do little. Slept, and did communicate with some company's and teachers. But nothing substantial.

Evening - eating with the group. A new member joined, Esmee, not sure what to make of her. Ilse and her were talking about their internships and gloating about it. At that moment I knew I wanted to leave. After dinner I left went home and played Fallout 1. If I am going to be depressed I am going to do it alone.

INTERNSHIT
-
It was supposed to start today. The time when a student works in a company and gains knowledge and even earns some money. I have tried my best finding a company, but to no avail. Feels like I've cursed myself by gloating how much experience I have, about how I've worked so hard to get where I am. It doesn't matter. You have to call at the right time, know the right people. It is not like I haven't tried. I've called so much and been rejected each time. Yeah rejection shouldn't be a big deal but after 10 attempts it gets depressing. ""No sorry we don't take interns anymore"" or ""sorry we already have someone"". It makes you think: what am I doing wrong? Why doesn't fate smile on me? Do I deserve this?

This morning I remembered a workplace I've visited before and how the guy who worked there said he was looking for a intern. I called him and he said I could come over. It went well, said there were options, I just need a project that I can work on. Oh, and by the way I don't do internship compensation, is what he said. Don't get me wrong I've worked for no money before. But it depends on the situation. Volunteering, sure! But doing the same job as my classmates, who get 300 euros each month. I can already imagine the conversation. ""Oh I make 300 euros a month and I work on the most coolest project and have the best teams to work with. How much do you make?"" It just the first day and I've already experienced this. Why do people keep talking about school/work after it? Fuck off man, it want to relax.

I've called teachers and will email them. Perhaps tomorrow new cards land in the deck.

MONEY IN MY MOUTH
-
It's been a long time since i've visited the dentist. The last time was in Mexico when my nephew helped me for free. In order to fix my teeth which was broken i've made a appointment with the dentist. During my checkup I was notified that I am not insured for my teeth, and that in order to fix all my teeth it would cost 1000 euros. As a student I was not happy to hear this.

At least the people who worked there were very kind to me, but damn man I just want to fix my teeth. So currently there are four options to choose.

1. I pay the 1000 euro for my teeth and I'll be without problems.
2. I wait until January and get a new insurance which covers my fucking teeth, I'll still lose about 400 euros
3. I get a ticket to Mexico and let my nephew help me, and also see my family whom I do really miss. Might cost me 800 euros (ticket and tip for nephew)
4. Do nothing at all. Saves me 1000 euros, but the consequences could be horrible for my teeth.

I made jokes with the dentists about selling my kidneys for money, and how I might just see them at my funeral. Buying a gun and blowing my brains out is the most economical options now, I'd also be rid of my damn internship problems.

Funny how my nephew told me to fix my teeth as soon as possible, and how now it might take until winter to fix fit. Funny.... funny.

Overal shit day. Hopefully tomorrow will be less of a wank. I give this day a 2/10 reasons to buy a 9mm on the black market."

I did not write yesterday, although i will compile and post. Yesterday was good (i will be saying good often since i boost too much self positive thoughts) since i drove again at night along with my brother! I parked the car on my own properly in a small space which i am proud of. And i went to the studio and kind of did some work related to Guinness. At evening i attended my best friends sister marriage reception which was a good juncture and chance to meet some of my school friends. Nevertheless a quite acted as if they have never even seen me in their life. But i loved the love which i got from my old friends who were so proud of my achievement and i am so grateful to them. I met ""everyone"" and the talk was so good! That is all for yesterday!

Today as usual i went to college and on the way back i had to go to the car dealer and finish off some work which my father gave. Then myself and my brother went to a hotel nearby and ate dosa and bonda like nomads. We were surprisingly very hungry, so we ate and left stomach swelling out of our shirts (gigs). After i came home, i was so so happy to see the leo fortune(bakery) cover which amma bought for us so that we would be happy for the evening snack! (big fan of bakery items). Then i went to the studio to collect the finished footage and came home and right now it says the video is uploaded. So i will go and check that! Bye!"

How about a vegan hotdog cart? I am so enthralled with this idea. How much money could I make?? If the location were right I feel like I could make a fortune. What a fun job it would be, too.

No health insurance, though.

Well, it's worth looking into.

Been having a lot of dreams about foreign travel.

...im currently typing one handed on my phone while feeding my baby/letting him nap on me.

I hope when my husband wakes up he takes a shift and lets me get some work done.

Grace Cathedral Hill. That's why I'm thinking of hotdog carts. Been singing that song to my baby.

Went to Janmashtami yesterday. Didn't get dressed up. Just went to pray. Baby cried because the Kirtan was blaring too loudly through the speakers.

But he calmed the and enjoyed seeing Krishna.

Fuck r/Aspergers. Just got a flashback to this time last year, think I'm a little traumatized.

Typing one handed...with just my thumb...scatters my thoughts.

Had one dream...where I couldn't find my baby. Then I thought I'd left him in the car ---my biggest fear.

I was consumed by my OCD but I'm getting better.

Alright, time for a few posts! Haven't updated in a few days and really need to get back on track of doing these daily! Lets see, what happened Friday? I know that I didn't work, but what did I do all day? This might have been when I cleaned the house up a bit? I don't think so though. I think I started playing some Overwatch again that day (which is pretty much how I've spent my whole weekend). I had some anxiety a know but feel pretty good today. Yesterday was pretty fun.  I worked another close shift with a manger that I like but that I never get to see which was pretty cool. I also got my favorite grill person again for close which is awesome, man that kid has a crazy life. After that I just came home and... played some Overwatch I think? And today was spent pretty much all day playing Overwatch and a bit of learning about Artifact. A pretty lame weekend I would say! Alright that's all for now. Hopefully Her and I will do something fun together tomorrow. "

Then after that...20...? More years of ""enjoyment""? Max?

What is that song about the exit to eternal summer slacking? And the children waking up and not being able to find them? Is it about teachers sneaking away from their students?

&#x200B;

Imagine if there WAS an exit to eternal summer slacking.

&#x200B;

Just...get off at that exit and never have to deal with a life of rushing to the teachers lounge to warm up a frozen burrito (that you'll have to scarf down while it's still half frozen), nor wearing depends because you literally only have a four minute restroom break (and you're forced to share a restroom with every girl in the entire sixth grade), nor not having adequate time to pump breast  milk for your own child, ever again."

Introweek at school.
-

I didn't have high hopes for the week. David cancelled on me and Jesper had a bruised foot. I mainly took care of the ""childeren"". The group was a lot of fun. The good thing was, was that we sticked together. We spent evenings and our mornings together. When didn't want to participate we chilled at one of our houses, and even watched a movie at the theater.

The feeling of being a leader, of being in front. Being important, it gave me so much energy. Even in mornings with little sleep I could wake up easily because in my head I had to. I had to set an example, and I loved to.

I drank a lot this week and was mostly tired and sick. So I didn't really have time to write. To summarize the things I endured during these days:

- I bruised my leg. Me and Martijn played American football, and he kicked the ball in the sky. I chased the ball looking towards the sky, tripping over a table and bruising my leg. My mobile phone is also curved now in the shape of my leg.
- I puked. But I wanted to, because if you did you'd get a ribbon. I was so proud when finally that ray of sunshine left my face.
- I sang Linkin park ""in the end"" in the club. For me this was an important moment. After asking for it 2 times. They finally put it on. Me and some other dudes were screaming along with. But then they stopped the song for another, but we kept singing, so they turned it back on. Dope moment.
- I danced like a maniac. At one moment I had a cloth in front of my face, and couldn't see anything. I felt a girl and danced like a lunatic with her. I put of my cloth and noticed who she was. The same girl I earlier had a crush on, but she didn't like me. Once noticed I went away, didn't want old feelings coming back. And I did the worm in front of random people.
- Watched the movie blackklansman in the theater, was fun.

HOLD ME TIGHT, AIGHT?
-
In the final moments of the week we held a feedback moment. I stood there in a circle with others, and behind me Irene grabbed me with her hand. Putting it on my stomach, and her face on my left shoulder. I grabbed her hand my right hand and played with her hand. I put my face softly against her head. We stood there for about 15 minutes with other people seeing us. Why would she suddenly do this? Not like I didn't like it. It's just that we don't know each other that well. Every time I see her I give her a hug. But that's all. We never had any real conversations. Despite it all, perhaps it was just friendly, perhaps she was just tired. In any case she felt comfortable enough to touch me, in a weird way I consider this alone to be a good thing.

AIRBORNE WALK
-
Originally we were supposed to walk with just us three. But a day before Lou cancelled. Maxime asked if I would prefer to walk with others or just us two. I said both are fine with me but still inching towards just us two because I want to know her better. We ended up going with the others. The walk was just 10 kilometers. But with my painful foots and bruised leg it was a bit difficult.

It was crowded and I don't really have a close click with the others (12 total). I did have a good time talking with Nicki, but with Maxime it felt off. I said some weird things and overal it was a bit awkward. At the end I was glad it was over. I wished I went with Jisse and his family. At the board night with his family I felt comfortable. In the future I do hope to attent more marathons.


The next weeks I don't have a internship because I still need to arrange something. During this free time i'm going to work on my diary and try to catch up."

It was such an amazing experience that I would never forget in my life! A slow old melody Hindi song and my bros driving was wowza for sure. Then me, my brother along with my father were talking for a long time. So overall, I feel this day was filled almost in every way. And yeah after class myself and my bro went to odyssey and I found a scrambled Rubik‚Äôs cube and I was tempted to solve it which I did. Then I found a good 5x5 and scrambled it and I solved on my own. It was so good. Overall- superb day!

So my birthday weekend was amazing. I met Matt Prater and he signed my hat for my birthday. Lions came back from a 27-6 loss to win 33-30. Got my dress fitted for my brothers wedding. Krispy Kreme for breakfast. Birthday was awesome.

I'm at 2 weeks of not smoking! I've had good support this time and hoping he helps me through it.

I'm so very happy to say the Ghost has officially stopped haunting me. His name popped up and I didn't have to lurch in my stomach. I don't think about him anymore. He's gone and I'm so happy about that.

I've been talking to this guy going on 3ish weeks. We hit it off really well. But, as all good things in my life, it won't stay that way. He's leaving in a few months. So until then we're just letting whatever happen, happen! I would love if he changed his mind but I won't force anything. But I'm falling and know he won't catch me but I won't blame him. He warned me he'd be leaving and not to get attached. Guess I'm not good at listening lol

Therapy is going ok? I don't want to talk about my past issues. Just my current ones. But all we talk about is how my ex slept with my only friend and how its affected me in both relationship and friendships. And its expensive until my insurance kicks in. But I'm going to make it work somehow because I think it can help in the long run, as long as we move past that specific topic.

Well, that's about it I guess. Just a waiting game to see how short this wave of happiness lasts."

Time to do some updating! Monday was a fine day from what I remember of it. I feel like this week is going by so fast already. I worked a bit that day but not for too long and all I did was play with a kid pretty much so it wasn't a big deal at all. What else did I do Monday.... nothing? We might have watched an episode of the expanse that day, we watched that together recently which was nice. Yesterday was really fun. I worked a short shift at work and it was very chill and enjoyable honestly. I didn't do much at all and just hung out with some work friends basically. After that I went home and we got ready for our concert. I wasn't all that hyped for the concert but I enjoyed it overall, it had really cool production and stuff. I feel like I don't remember it super well which is weird. I got Her some merch as an early anniversary gift. We got home pretty late and went to sleep since we both had big adult things to do in the morning. I went to my orientation for school today and She had Her interview. I felt like orientation went well, people were friendly and it seemed I got useful information about stuff. Her interviewed seemed to go well but then at the end of it they told Her She didn't have as much experience as they wanted on paper for the position She applied for...then why did they call Her back? Weird. They did offer Her some other options though and She is waiting to Her back about those and isn't sure if She would want those positions anyway. After I got home I took a long nap, ate some food, and now am about to get ready to go to bed. "

UTI stuff again.

So for a while I just didn't want to go on my laptop because I've been so anxious. The whole weekend (aside from work) I was in bed watching Netflix. I have finished Supernatural (watched it for a couple of months), watched Saiki K (funny), I forget what else...

Last night I was considering going back to playing some video games, something I haven't done in a long time. I used to be just a casual gamer who liked playing RPGs... but eventually lost interest even though I used to game since I was a kid.

Anyway I was super, super anxious. I had to stop taking my antibiotic (Macrobid) on Wednesday, so Thurs - Sun I had no medication. I was thinking that I was going eventually going to go to the hospital, get into sepsis, and die.

I even wrote down my pin number for my bank account in case my mom and stepdad needed money (stepdad had me put in 2.5k into my account since he doesn't have a bank account). I wrote a page detailing the timeline of what happened, from the beginning of my UTI to now.

I had a flare-up on Friday when I just repeatedly went to the toilet. I was drinking water after I peed, then peed, then drank more water. I was getting dehydrated from all the peeing. I still am dehydrated on Monday.

I went to the doctor, told him that I still have my UTI (saw a different doctor at the same clinic last time). I was sore at my sides (infection was crawling up) and it still hurt when he pressed down where my bladder was. I gave him the results of when I went to Planned Parenthood regarding my UTI, so it's not like I was faking having a UTI.

Asked him to refer me to a gynocologist (didn't give me any paperwork or anything), he said should I be getting testing as women should be tested on their health (pap smears and such).

I also gave a urine sample and he told me to call back as the results would be ready in 48 hours, so they'll figure out which bacteria it is and which antibiotic the bacteria would it be sensitive to... I hope I'm not allergic to the medication as well... So I'll call on Wednesday. He also said to come back in 2 weeks.

The medication I have to eat with food, it's called Doxycycline Hyclate. I read around on it after it was prescribed to me and I shouldn't ingest it before I lie down because residue can eat away at the esophagus. So lie down after 1-2 hours and take it once every 12 hours. The pharmacist didn't tell me that after I asked about side-effects, maybe he didn't know... I don't know.

I took my first dose at 1:30 pm so next I have to take it at 1:30 am. And since I can't sleep for 1-2 hours, I have to sleep at 2:30 or 3:30. I have to change my sleeping schedule as I have to wake up in the mornings around 9.

I told my coworker and she was like ""Man you have to have a whole timetable for that shit like an old person"" lol. I mean... I always keep track of time when I need to.

During my shift today I noticed after the first dose that I had a slight headache (not a migraine), apparently from what I read that it's a sign of increased blood pressure to the brain. That's spooky, I felt increased blood pressure in my foot too like it was really pumping. It's not a good sign. Also joint pains in my thumbs and fingers but it went away, hoping it's just a one-time thing. Meds are stronger when taken consecutively.

Hope I get changed on meds that'll kill the infection when I call in on Wednesday.

For now I'm going to keep taking it easy, I need to be less stressed and anxious. Rearrange my room, clean up a bit (it's been getting messy because I was too stressed to clean), maybe play some video games. I was looking up easygoing games that I haven't played in the past but it seems like the gaming scene for relaxing games hasn't been much. I'm kind of picky so that probably also explains my lack of interest in games.

Games I like are role playing games (RPGs). I like customizing my character. Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons is ok, I usually stop playing after I marry a bachelor LMAO. Priorities. The game gets tedious after a while, I tend to favor games that are more based on free choice, dialogue, relationships... I liked Rune Factory 4 for the 3DS (and it was funny). Animal Crossing was a good game too, I played it for quite a long time. Maybe I'll get back into Pokemon, I know nothing about Sun/Moon Pokemon, just the older versions.

Anyway that's all. Back to life. Thanks for reading."

At first I didn't know what was going on. When we were busy I was taking things in my own hand. I wanted that flag and I wanted it beautiful, truly Spanish, truly latin. The rest wasn't really motivated but I wanted that flag to be what I wanted, it pushed me to the limit in a good way. I spent so much time making it unique, and worthy. I was stressing and it didn't end up like I wanted.

 Afterwards we went out and danced and drinked a lot. Jesper got drunk quickly and went to bet early. I danced a lot and drank a lot, and had a good time. So far I have a good relation with my children. It's been awhile since I've danced and felt so happy

8/10. I wished Jesper was a bit more loyal to the childeren, but he payed a godly amount of money on drinks.  ( 80 euro ?) A good day :)"

Alright, time for two more posts! Yesterday was pretty good. What day was yesterday, Saturday? Oh, not much to talk about there besides the fact that I worked all day. I worked 10-12 and then 3-12. What a fun time! I didn't even get to work with any of my work friends because one of them quit, one called off, and the other one just happened to have that shift off. Laaame. It still wasn't too bad of a closing shift I suppose. Made decent tips. I showed and stayed up a bit later than I should have but ended up having to wake up early for a mandatory meeting at 8:30 that only lasted half an hour this morning. Her and went shopping to get Her stuff for Her interview and we also shopped at a store that's going out of business and we ended up getting a clothing display table for cheap that we are now using as a dinning room table and I like it a lot actually! What a deal. There were also some pants left that I wanted but I am waiting to buy because I'm hoping they will get cheaper and they had like 10 pairs of them left so I'm not worried if they run out. She looked good in Her little work interview outfit She got. And She also got some new makeup thanks to the nice people at Sephora. We ended the day getting a few things at the grocery store, giving out kitten a flee bath (we put mite spray on him but it ended up going too low so he needed a bath and was itching anyway), and watching some tv together. A good day I would say. Alright, that's all for now."

Morning - waking up at 14:00

Midday - traveling to Eindhoven to chill with old friends. Traveling was shitty with train, kept making mistakes which ended up me arriving later. Oh, how I've missed them. The simplicity, the nostalgia.

Evening - eating and chilling. Afterwards we went pooling. That was a lot of fun. We kept shouting tacdicks (tactics) when someone made a bad mistake. I haven't cried by laughing in a while.

9/10, would've been a 10 if my train travelling wasn't shitty. I love my friends.

Midday - playing music with Chaline and Jisse. I love making music, the synergy and preparation and the fun in between. I want this to keep going.

Evening - taking 5 2cb pills with Thomas. Absolutely bonkers. Went out in the evening during the trip to get food, that was interesting. Had fun. Never tripped so hard.

LEAVE IT HANGING
~
The intro week has started, a whole week of drinking partying and being out.

It started with David ( my friend and partner ) not coming for Saturday. I figured this wouldn't be a large problem. I can understand skipping a day because the week is so long. But the next day he called me and said he was sick and couldn't be there the whole week. Thankfully I had Jesper able to support me. It feels like a punch that David canceled. Did I make a mistake? Am I not a good friend? I'm sure I messed up.

It's probably the fatigue, but I'm tired. It feels like I am about to break any moment now. I like going out, but everyday with these people is exhausting. I like these people but I wouldn't call them my friends, except for a small few. It all feels so hollow, I can see them interacting. The need for attention, it gets to my head. The others socialize and do things. I miss my friends, who understand who I am and support me.

I feel down at the moment, decided to go to sleep so I can feel better tomorrow. But the feeling of loneliness is overwhelming. Thankfully I have Jesper but at times he is gone leaving me alone. I don't have the energy to communicate with the others. I can't help but feel that I am a asshole mistreating those around me. I am not a social acceptable guy. I feel like I bring others down. The world is great, but I bring it down."

I wish I could just stop going to work. Like, I wish that tomorrow the day would start at work and I would be no where to be found. My lesson power points wouldn't be uploaded to the team drive. My teammates would be rolling their catty little eyes and cursing my name. Soon every one would be trying to call me. But I wouldn't answer.

‚Äã

They'd be calling and texting, emailing. But, I'd never answer. Where would my phone be? Maybe in the ocean or some other cliche thing.

They'd have to split my students up amongst themselves.

For days they'd be calling. The principal would be calling. H.R. would be calling. They'd be calling my husband, my emergency contact. But he wouldn't answer either. ...Would they eventually send someone to my home?

They would never see or hear from me again. I would delete my Facebook.

‚Äã

Where would I be? I don't know. Maybe in Aruba. Or maybe in India. Wherever I'd go, I'd have a million bucks. That's what I need. Some fuck off money.

‚Äã

I would play with my baby and have plenty of time to breast feed and to pump and to feed myself as well. I'd hire some help, so my baby could always have someone to hold and play with him even while I'm eating or doing laundry and and I would have time to reddit and watch Orange is the New Black and I wouldn't have to worry about grammar and lesson plans and grading and editing shared drives and other super tedious shit ever again."

UGh. Sneezing like a biiiiiitch. I must be allergic to something in this apartment but damn if I know what. Today was fine. I worked a little bit. I really should be trying to get more hours at my other job since my main job isn't giving me many, it's just not as enticing when I get 5 dollars less per hour. Anyways, today was pretty good. I am going to be ending seeing one of my clients soon because of scheduling reasons and I feel like my boss should be the one to tell them that and not me. I had some anxiety today but not too much. Oh, I also made dinner for Her and I. I just googled a few of the things we had in the apartment and threw the word 'recipe' at the end and it gave a good result. I was pleased with and She enjoyed it too! Besides that I just watched a bunch of TI. I am behind so I'm watching vods and Her brother thinks it's weird I don't just check the scores and watch live. What savage watches tournaments like that! Anyway, that's all for now. Also, She's super sweet and I'm lucky to have Her <3"

For my uti/urinary tract infection I went to Planned Parenthood. They were nice and good listeners but unfortunately they couldn't prescribe an antibiotic I was allergic to or have taken before, they had a limit on what they could prescribe.

I went back to urgent care and unfortunately I couldn't go back for the same infection twice so I was turned away...

I had already cried it out a few days ago so I'm honestly feeling hopeless. I was eating pho at a restaurant with my sister and I just ate so slowly and lifelessly. My favorite music group released a new album today and I listened to it last night... and then after the doctor visits I barely listened at all.

I was reading up on other antibiotics and I'm afraid I'll be prescribed Cipro from the horror stories because it has caused people nerve damage. I got some nerve damage from Macrobid and had to stop use of it, hence why I went to Planned Parenthood and urgent care again.

My last resort is the ER but I don't have a kidney infection... yet.

My quality of life is suffering. I look in the mirror and I have a dead look in my eyes. I don't know what to do.

I don't have faith in my doctor and his assistants. I'm losing faith in the medical industry. It's not like I want this UTI.

Why are there so many medications with bad side effects? Nerve damage?? Allergic reactions?? Medicine is so scary... I know it's supposed to help... it's a pick-your-poison scenario... be cured of uti but get other possible life changing debilitating effects.

There's a whole sub dedicated to Cipro called /r/floxies I believe. Bad stories...

I'm afraid I'll get prescribed a medication that will adversely affect me and make me become physically compromised and I can't ever do what I want to do again... travel... work... enjoy concerts... simple outing with friends without needing some kind of accommodation... can't do basic things without hurting... I'm basically laying in bed right now because physical activity irritates my bladder and I'd need to pee even though I just did.

Fuck my life.

Edit: oh it's my cake day... happy cake day."

I let the anxiety beast take over my head a bit earlier in the day but am doing better now. She had a rough day so I tried to do some chores around the house so it was nicer for Her when She got home. I also ended up getting Her dinner on my way home from work because She wanted Taco Bell (I skipped eating out and made dinner at home though, go me!). I only worked 2 hours today. I can't live on only 2 hours a week. I will ask my other boss if it might be possible for me to get a few hours next week as I will be needing them. I have bills to pay and I some how start school in 2 weeks. 2 weeks! It is here so fast! I don't feel prepared at all ugggh. Also, She has a job interview next week which is exciting!

Thurs.
Alright, it's been a while! My lack of posting started because we had visitors for a few days (that was my excuse) and then I just didn't do it due to laziness I would say :p which isn't good. But there is no time like the present! Ok. Thursday was a good day. Actually, it was awful. We ended up having a bed bug issue at my job which still has myself and my gf on edge. Her brother ended up showing up and helping me out with trying to avoid bringing bugs into our home. What else did we do that day. I think Her other brother came over and we played some games for a bit? Or we just chilled and watched youtube. A decent day overall.

Fri.
This day was greatt! I worked with my fav client for the majority of the day and then I later go to do fun stuff with family and friends. Me and a lot of Her family ended up doing two escape rooms which were both fun. I enjoyed the 2nd one a lot more and I feel like it was probably the room where I have done the most so far. I didn't do anything in the first one because my gf did everything :p we also ate delicious Mediterranean food which is cool.

Sat.
I had to go to work this day which wasn't too bad, but before that we got to play some games of Pandemic with people. I also went to give a coworker a ride to work (100% out of my way btw) and they ended up not fucking responding and coming out of their house. So that was really annoying, they even had the nerve to ask me for a ride home after out shift (they showed up 3 hours late). I don't know what I did after this shift. I know I ended up sleeping before showering because I felt gross.

Sun.
This might have been the day where I felt like watching a lot of movies? I think it very well might have been. I ended up watching 3 billboards outside ebbing Missouri which was really good, after that I watched Murder on The Orient Express (the new one that came out recently) and I found it to be pretty boring. I also started watching the movie Battle Royle but ended up going to bed before finishing it.

Mon.
This day I didn't work until later in the day so I decided to finish watching Battle Royle, this movie was excellent! I totally get why it's a cult classic and I want to read the book for it now. Afterwards I watched Lady Bird which I can't say enough bad things about. What a waste of time watching that shit film. It's a coming of age story that I could relate 0% to and the ""jokes"" all fell flat. Literally all of them. Afterwards I watched Dallas Buyers Club which I liked a lot. I thought everyone did really well in their roles and the movie was interesting and had good pacing. I did have some worried and bad thoughts about Her and made some questionable decisions but I think I feel ok with everything.

Tues.
Today I also had a rough morning making bad choices but not toooo bad and still having worries about Her and us and stuff. I overthink things too much sometimes and these few days were just some of these times (I think). What I else did I do today. She made this pretty delicious chicken ceaser pasta stuff for dinner. Idr what I did all evening. I might have watched an episode of Man In The High Castle. And I also did laundry I'm pretty sure. Maybe dishes and trash too, but that might have been Monday now that I think about it.

Wed.
Today was fine I guess. I actually got good hours at work (I still need to schedule for the week, ugh.) It felt like a long day of work though followed by a short evening that went by too fast. I made some bacon just because and decided to try making a peanut butter and bacon sandwich which was...dry. The second one I made I added some syrup and a slice of provolone and it was better, especially with mustard. Besides that I've just been watching a lot of TI videos. Trying to catch up on that really quick. Also watched the new Overwatch short which was very underwhelming (not that I care about lore for that game anyway). Alright, that's all for now! Wowie, what a big update."

Morning - supposed to help the group at school but I woke up at 13:00 so I didn't go. Not like I wouldn't gone if I were on time.

Midday - Playing drums, chilling. Calling potential internships, being denied by all of them, again. How demotivating. Calling and just knowing you're getting denied. Made me throw my phone away after the conversation, it was getting frustrating. I am qualified, have plenty of experience and good grades. Don't I deserve this?

Evening - Playing some sports with roommates. Frisbee was boring, enjoyed playing with the american football, more energetic. Having a couple beers with Ilse, witch was fun.

TRANSLATE YOUR EMOTIONS PLEASE

In the evening Ilse asked if I would you like to come over for boozes. She didn't ask the others? Makes me wonder what she sees in me? Am I a romantic option for her, or just a good friend? Either way, despite going in with doubts we actually had a lot of fun just talking. We talked about romantic options, and how she had a crush on someone I knew. Of course I knew who and said so, she is quite obvious in how she shows it. Reminds me of a night when a friend told me she was obviously in to me. I shrugged it off and said she just talked and danced with me because I'm her friend.

All in all I do not wish to pursue a further relation with her. Being a friend like today was good enough. Talking without there being some sort of pressure is more fun.

morning - like I wasn't sleeping

midday - waking up playing some drums, made some real progress with the song. Doing volunteer work for refugees, cooking. Had a lot of fun with Lou and Maxime. Didn't expect that I would click with them that well. We made plans to walk the airborne route on 1 september together just the three of us. Usually I don't stay too long, but today I had a lot of fun talking, even stayed for some coffee.

evening - chilling, listening to music. And as I am writing this agreeing to go out with friends and some other people, we'll see how it goes. I'm going on bike so I can leave early if I like.

EDIT *

OUT, AND WITHOUT
-
So I went out and yeah it was fun. Could I take the night away if I could: yes absolutely. I've made dumb mistakes, seen people make dumb mistakes. No progression at all. Empty, hollow interactions.

The mistake if made? Yeah I grabbed a friends between his legs with both hands and lifted him up. Absolutely moronic. I instantly felt shitty. As reconciliation I gave him my apologies and asked if he wanted to hit me as hard as he could. So he hit me between my lungs at my rib cage, it hurt, a lot. But I guess I deserved it, gave him my apologies more, saying that was a stupid mistake I made, yet I still feel stupid, that is not me. How can I be like this?

The things I have seen. Lighthearted when you see it then. But now afterwards it breaks me down. Seeing people dance absolutely crazy, knocking people down. Seeing someone grind my friend unsolicited by an older man. She asked for help, at first I didn't understand her, but then I saw the hands around her. The old man grabbing her from behind. I took her hands and dragged her away. It makes me remember what Lou said this midday. About how at work men say and do sexual intimidating things. And how it happens often, it is sickening.

So yeah overal this was a good day. Had fun making playing music. Had a lot of fun doing volunteer work, meeting new people and talking with them. And talking with Lou and Maxime. ~~9/10~~. But going out worsened it. Maybe it is because i'm a bit drunk and tired. But I know this night is going to haunt me. *7.5/10*

I was prescribed Macrobid (nitrofurantoin monohydrate) last Saturday in urgent care. It's Wednesday.

It's an antiobiotic for my urinary tract infection (UTI).

https://www.rxlist.com/macrobid-drug/patient-images-side-effects.htm

The side effect that was really bothering me was tingling in my arms and legs, as well as warmth. Apparently it's called peripheral neuropathy - numbness, tingling, or pain in hands or feet. It messes with your nerves. The side effects vary from person to person and in serious cases all feeling can be lost. Or worse. I had tingling for 2 hours in my legs yesterday, tingling in my fingers after I first took it, tingling in my left arm, unusual warmth in my left arm and leg at different times... Also too much information but when I pooped it was also bloody, more so than I was used to and it didn't even hurt.

I called urgent care that I got the prescription from and they said to stop taking it.

I called my doctor and I still can't come in until my appointment on Monday. I was asking whether I should wait to see him to get a new prescription or go to another urgent care. They called me back in an hour and said to go to urgent care. They didn't see anything on my last culture, most likely because I was in the middle of taking antiobiotics while I gave a urine sample. The receptionist also mentioned that I keep getting UTIs and reacting to the medications I've been prescribed... it's not intentional!

I'm so stressed. I have cried a couple of times because of this dumb urinary tract infection. I've been dealing with the flareups for 3 months already. On top of going to the bathroom so many times... I'm worried it will get worse and I'll end up in the ER. I don't have the money for it.

Plus multiple urgent care visits, bad side effects from antibiotics, doctor visits, so much of my time used up because of it. I have to change my eating habits and from researching I have to avoid sugar but sugar is in so many things! I don't know what to eat!

It is so stressful. I'm tired. I just want to get better and return to my normal life.

edit: After I wrote this post my sister recommended that I go check out Planned Parenthood. I didn't know that they also do women's health, which a urinary tract infection falls under. I decided to not go to urgent care for now and will go to my Planned Parenthood appointment on Friday. I called, see if they took my particular insurance, and then made an appointment.

I really hope it goes well... I hadn't cried in a long time and I cried out my stress earlier. I really needed it.

I still am having odd sensations in my limbs from Macrobid, pins and needles, heaviness when walking, slight numbness... can't wait till it wears off in 9 hours-ish. I wish it was easy to get rid of this UTI I've been battling since June. So much health bullshit. At least I know which antibiotics are and aren't compatible with me...

Bactrim - no (allergic). Keflex - yes (can't take it again due to possible bacterial resistance). Macrobid - no (experiencing peripheral neuropathy/affecting my nerves)."

Haven't written in a while. Jetlag makes me only sleep at around 07:00. I already miss my family in Mexico but life goes on. The last time I have written was in London, before I flew back home. In the plane I sat next to a nice youngman. I tapped him and asked how his vacation was, he answered he was doing a internship in Amsterdam. Spoke the entire flight with him, cool dude. Afterwards I gave him a mexican pesos and he gave me an english pence. Thanks John!

Arrived way to late in the Netherlands. My next train would leave at 3:03. I had to wait 4 hours more. Thankfully my friend was able to pick me up. The next day I was back I went on a date. Yeah, with the same girl I wrote about earlier. (2 august) I wrote about how she doesn't have a strong character. When I still was in customs in America, she and I texted a lot. We talked much and she dropped some spicy hints, this was a side of her that interested me. How she wasn't afraid to show interest. So we sort of went on a date. I'm not sure date is the correct word. Either way I don't really care what it was, it was a bland. Sure we talked a lot and playing pool was fun. But honestly I couldn't care less for the stuff she said. It was too detailed and without emotion. She didn't reciprocate whenever I got flirty. Bland. We'll just stay friends.

Been going out a lot since I came back. First day was fun, didn't went long. Second day was ok, but became annoyed by the shitty music. Another fucking cranberries - zombies hardstyle mix, fucking kill me. Atleast it wasn't shitty dutch music.

Been jamming again with my friends. Learning The black keys - Tighten up at the moment. It's good to play the drums again. Had a lot of fun.

Still have a lot of contact with the family. But messaging all, and maintaining contact is more than I can handle. And I still need to get a internship before september begins, good thing is I communicated my difficulties with my school coach. So atleast he is aware.

AND TOMMOROW I'M GOING TO CALL A DENTIST BEFORE MY TOOTH GETS INFECTED AND I'M GOING TO CALL FOR POSSIBLE INTERNSHIPS. Please stop fucking myself over k thx."

I went to urgent care for my UTI again, the one open today was in LA so I headed there to see if I really did have it. Did the urine sample and indeed I do have a UTI.

I have more respect for this doctor because he listened to everything that I said and wanted to be more thorough. Asked why I didn't see my doctor and I told him that I couldn't see him until the last week of the month since he's booked. Asked which medications I took and if I was allergic. He prescribed me an antibiotic that I haven't taken before (he knows about resistances!!). Also I had to get an antibiotic shot in the butt lol.

THAT was awkward, I didn't know how to show my butt - lift my maxi skirt? But the assistant who gave the shot told me to pull the top of my skirt down and I was like... oh. He was professional about it.

I didn't feel like I was brushed off after leaving, which I'm thankful for. My doctor and the other urgent care place didn't seem to care as much...

Anyway while I was in LA I went over to Koreatown to buy some things I wanted. And then I ate and took the medication. It was really hot, I walked the whole way (took the train and then walked) and I was sweating.

After I ate, I headed back home because I was so tired. The medication kicked in because I started feeling unusually drowsy and I was fighting keeping my eyes open on the train (sleeping on public transportation here is a no-no because of thieves).

It took a while but I finally got home, took a shower, and then just rested. I got pain medication with the antibiotic so I don't have to keep running to the toilet.

Also my mom is in the hospital for a kidney infection, so I've been home alone. I haven't visited her yet, I was going to today after I showered but my stepdad already left. So I will see her tomorrow because I'm sure she's lonely. And not getting visited by a family member feels bad if I were in her place. My mom may give me a hard time and though we don't have the best relationship, I care about her... I haven't told her I got a UTI again or that I went to urgent care because she has anxiety and will worry more.

My stepdad has been spending time at home doing things for my mom (cooking food for her, cleaning). My mom also didn't want me to be lonely, but joke's on her I'm always lonely. Just kidding. Okay I get lonely a lot, but I manage. It's weird seeing my stepdad so much because he lives in his own place (for religious reasons, wouldn't want people to keep coming over our place so we live separately).

Well, that's all. I will keep resting. I have work tomorrow but it's thankfully a short day."

I remember being left home alone. All the time when I was in high school. My alcoholic dad would go on days long binges and wouldn‚Äôt appear or call. I remember being pregnant. And left alone. It was difficult. Having a father who was gone and being pregnant by a man who also decided he didn‚Äôt want to be around. I remember opening the fridge to find nothing. A few pieces of bread and a lone egg. Cooked it up and ate it. Laying on the couch with the tv on. I was 16 and lost and looking for someone, anyone. Thank goodness for friends. For on some days there were no egg or bread. I‚Äôd go to friends houses. Hoping their mother was making some kind of dinner or would offer some kind of snack. They often did. One of my friends mom would even pack a to go plate to bring to my father. (Did she know?) maybe just a polite cultural thing. I was jealous. Of friends with mothers. Friends with fathers who had a job. And provided. And were home...

I wasn‚Äôt alone in being less than fortunate. Where we lived there was a lot of that. But i was definitely the worse off on some days.


I‚Äôd love to help. Those in need. What brought all of this up today? My beautiful kids saying they were done eating. But I always have a habit of scraping their plate up and giving them their one last bite. ‚ÄúEat‚Äù, I say. ‚ÄúThere are children all around the world who have nothing to eat. Kids right around here, down the street maybe. Eat.‚Äù And then I remembered. The feeling. Ever been so hungry that you had sleep for dinner? You don‚Äôt want to leave the house or see anyone. You lie down. And sleep.

I‚Äôd love to help. Those in need. But where do you find ‚Äúthose‚Äù? People don‚Äôt exactly advertise the fact that they‚Äôre starving and poor. People who go to food pantry‚Äôs and churches, those are already getting help. Where are the kids of the drug addicts? Absent fathers? The kids where if you‚Äôre the oldest you take care of all the littles? The kids who come from all too prideful families (my dad) and would never ask for anything. Any help. Would never apply for food stamps. Would never go to a food donation center. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a beggar. We are not beggars.‚Äù, he would say. No. Just drunks, I suppose.

I give all I can when I can. I email my kids teachers and say if there is anyone who can‚Äôt afford school supplies that I would be more than happy to buy them. I bring extra supplies and snacks etc for anyone who might have ‚Äúforgot‚Äù. I am fortunate. My children have never gone a day without. I pray that they never do. We have dogs. That is such a privileged thing. We have food. An abundance of it. We have all that we need. This is why we protest. This is why we march. This is why we try. And yet, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm making any sort of difference or enacting change.

I‚Äôm sorry for this world. I‚Äôm sorry for all of the ugly happening. I‚Äôm sorry for the drug epidemic happening and for the poor babies who don‚Äôt have clean pajamas or cereal to eat in the morning. Or the teenagers who have to go out and sell drugs to help their mom pay bills. Everyone is so quick to judge everyone else. Noses up. More compassion please. More empathy please. More love please. If you have, give. If you don‚Äôt have, I hope you have people around you who recognize and love you and give with full hearts without making you feel any sort of shame.

Please feel free to leave some advice or opinions

Monday is my first therapy session in about 2 years. The last time I went, I went once and that was it (for multiple reasons). So I've been struggling with a lot of stuff lately, mainly revolving around being lonely. I know that, I acknowledge it. I scheduled this appointment and hope to stick with it. But the past few days, since securing the appointment, I've had ""better"" days. Not exactly good or great, just better. So it's hard to think of all the things that have driven me to making this appointment. My best friend said to just write anything down I think of so I can remember later to talk to the therapist about. And I have been.

What am I to expect? Is it ok to not bring everything up at once? Or should i try to get as much out as possible? The issues I had last time I went aren't all the same reasons I'm going now. Is it ok that I'm nervous/scared? Sometimes I feel I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but sometimes I feel it's good I'm going. Any input from anybody?"

Ranting.

I suspect I have gotten a UTI again as I have been going to the restroom with little urine. Not as urgent right now, but I used a UTI home test from Azo to test and the color changed to a darker one as opposed to when I finished my antibiotics. Positive for leukocytes (white blood cells) that indicate infection.

I called my doctor for an appointment and I won't be able to see him for 10 days. I want to know the results of my urine culture and to see if I can get another one to make sure that I do not have it again (if the test was false-positive). I mean, it would only be logical to do a urine culture while NOT taking antibiotics right?

And I'm tired of having a UTI for 2 months already. I do not want to go to an urgent care center again.

I really dislike this logic:

1. Urgent care tells me to see doctor after prescribing me an antibiotic.

2. I see the doctor, they say ""why are you here if you have the medication?"" Like... why do everyone (friends, urgent care) say to see my doctor if my doctor's only solution was to prescribe medication? At least he made me do a urine culture, but it was in the middle of taking antibiotics (which can interfere with results), he didn't recognize that I had an allergic reaction to my first antibiotic, and he just didn't really seem to care at all.

I should probably change my doctor by now. I'll do that after my appointment on the 27th."

I figured that I would do a diary. Why not?

____

My cat, Nala, died on Sunday. Two days after an anniversary of my previous beauty, Shira. I feel like I'm not meant to have them. I feel so much guilt for their deaths because I usually just them go outside when I leave for work. Because someone would usually be home to let them in during that time.

With Shira, I found her. With Nala, my husband, Shawn found her..
It's hard got both of us. We both love animals like they are our babies. Our little ""furbabies"". I honestly hate that term. But that's how we feel.

So losing Nala was hard. We're still trying to recover from it. Being in a stressful living situation, this was a hard hit.

Watching Shawn cry was heart wretching. But he was so strong for me. I felt so... I don't know. Watching him practically hurt his body to make a grave for her. He wrapped her in one of his shirts in such a delicate way. It reminded me of when we got her those stupid little cat sweaters and how much she hated it. But I realized she was gone.

After he did all this, he wrapped his arms around me and sobbed.
We cried together for a while. Then we decided to get her flowers like we did with Shira.

I just want her back. I want more time with her. I want to kiss her forehead and scratch under her chin. Watch her jump onto the fence and tease the dogs to chase her. Her cute way of rubbing against the walls with mild purring every morning. Her annoying antics to be let outside like jumping into the kitchen counters or running amok up and down the hall at 5 in the morning. How she would greet everyone that came home at the front door with a loud meow.

I miss you, Nala baby."

I go off topic a few times lmao.

08.13.18

Had the day off. I was busy on Sunday and a little bit on Monday trying to download some some Ad*be programs for free lmao. I just wanted to see if I could do it. I tried before, but I didn't understand the guide the first time months ago because I didn't read it carefully and I was sleepy. But I actually read it this time yesterday, made some mistakes along the way, but I did it! I was so thankful I made a post over in the /r/piracy sub thanking the people behind it and one of the mods gilded the post, it was really unexpected. It was enough having the programs, but the mod went and gilded... it was kind of them to do that as a ""you're welcome"" kind of thing. Actually I'm not sure why they did that, but I appreciate that they felt good enough to do that. :')

After that, I was just chillin on Twitter, learning about doing some color editing on Photoshop by following a tutorial... I like BTS and they uploaded some nice photos on their twitter for their new album release later this month, so I was editing those pictures as practice.

By the way, this [video](https://twitter.com/autumnin1997/status/1029176240333193216) on Twitter for one of the members (the leader) made me laugh, every time I thought about it I just start laughing. He loves finding little crabs on the beach, but the video was edited in such a weird way that it looked like he threw the crab into the ocean (he did not). It just transitioned into him and another member skipping rocks, but the editing made it look like... ""hello friend... goodbye friend!"" * *throws crab* * But he really loves sea animals so much that he doesn't even eat seafood. Anyway... back on topic.

8.14.18

Worked today. Corporate was supposed to visit with an important guy, but I worked the whole day without seeing them (thank goodness). I received a shipment today right in the morning so it was hot. The store was full in the back so I had to wheel everything out to the front. I'm good with my section so there's hardly any issues with it, it's just the workload that's too much given the amount of hours I have plus the number of responsibilities too.

Off topic, when I first received the food section last year, there wasn't as many responsibilities as there are now. More and more food vendors, more paperwork, more food to stock, not great hours because Corporate gives each store a certain amount of hours... I hardly had time to keep up with stocking. Hence why I have an assistant, I kept saying that I needed help and I agreed to have her in my section. It was mutual. She's my assistant, but we get paid the same anyway. One day she will be up to speed, it just kind of sucks that our shifts don't coincide so I can't personally teach her things she needs to know, I have to type everything out and communicate on paper.

But as a result of the rise in responsibilities, I am getting more experience and got irritated with work enough to want to learn Microsoft Excel on my own time. By the way... I bought a key off someone for Microsoft Office for like $15 and it's a legit copy too. Microsoft Office usually goes for like $100+ and I'm just not about that life.

Anyway during my lunch today I went to the nearby boba shop (or bubble tea) since I was craving a drink and something sweet, and I saw one of my coworkers! He works there on Tuesdays so he took my order on paper and gave me free drinks! I expected one as I ordered one drink, yet to my surprise he handed me two drinks! I was like ""Did someone ask for that drink?"" (sometimes people ask to get a drink for them) and he was like ""No it's yours."" I was shook, but happily so. And he was busy so we both said bye, but I was happy. I tipped him the cost for the drink I was going to pay for originally. :)

Oh, and at work there is a rumor among the employees that the store is haunted. Stuff like... seeing a little boy, the backdoor swinging open on its own, the trash can moving on its own as if someone was throwing out trash, boxes moving on their own (like there was something inside but nothing is inside except for products), etc.

My coworker showed me a video that happened yesterday, it was when she was in the backroom by herself and a marker moved on its own as if someone rolled it. I would've tried to debunk it, but it wasn't sitting on top of anything and the shelf was not slanted. But interesting, wish there was something like a shadow person or something more... obvious. But it's just little things.

Regarding the little boy, my other coworker saw him months ago but he was crouched so the cameras couldn't see him. I don't really take it seriously, but I love hearing the stories.

Something did happen to me too while I was in the bathroom months back, but not really a big deal. So I was in the employee restroom doing a numero dos while browsing on my phone and I heard a light knock on the door and no one talking. Usually my coworkers would notice if someone is in the restroom and leave the door alone or use the toilet in the other restroom, so I thought whoever it was must've been desperate lol. I thought I just imagined it so I stayed there, but a few minutes later I heard a few more knocks so I hurried up. After I peeked my head out the restroom door, I looked around and no one was there. I saw my coworkers in the office across the backroom (not close) and I called out to them asking if anyone knocked on the door. Everyone was like ""no"" so I was like wtf. So that's my story lmao, not scary or anything like that.

Back to my day, my ex-stepdad took me home and I talked about how my little sister was sleeping with my other sister's cat. Me and my siblings all love cats. My parents don't.

Background, we have a language barrier as I primarily speak English but they speak Cambodian so it's hard to communicate often times without misunderstandings. I wasn't raised to speak Cambodian nor are there good classes out there.

And likewise there aren't good classes for Cambodian speakers to get good at English, but honestly English is a hard language. People who say that people should be fluent after living the US for many years are native English speakers, so they don't understand that there aren't classes for every language out there, especially good ones. And it'd be costly too as not everyone can afford it. It takes a lot of effort and resources to learn another language in general.

Sorry I rambled again lmao. Back to cats, my mom and ex-stepdad have mentioned that people get cat hair in their nose and have a hard time breathing... but what they really meant is that people can get allergic. But my ex-stepdad called it asthma, which has a totally different meaning. So just imagine me sitting there going ""what"" and trying to explain that people don't get asthma just by getting allergies... or do they. Never heard of it. Oh shit, I just googled it, allergy-induced asthma is a thing. Holy shit. Wow. Okay I give them credit then lmao. I have much to learn about allergies. Today I learned.

Anyway that's all. I half rambled, half talked about my day. lmaoo"

FOREIGN UNIVERSITY
-
visiting UNAM for a possible minor / student exchange. Really loved the school, all the facilities are on campus are free and the area is very large. Once back at home I want to arrange it. If I could I would love to join the faculty American football team.

MEXICAN BONER
-
On the way to the school we were joined by Paco a friend of my cousin's. He mentioned how I shouldn't come here because the country is shit. Pretty much the opposite of my brother who seems to get a hard-on from anything Mexican related, kind of similar to Nazis and the arian race. Hard-ons not because of what it does but of what it is.  Personally I like this country but I wouldn't say it beats other countries. Yeah I like it here, but that is mainly because of my family and the culture.

A HOLE IN TOOTH
Afterwards getting my teeth checked and drilled by my cousin. My tooth is a gaping hole now. In Holland I need to get it fixed, which might cost a lot of money. Funny how one stupid ball to my face caused this.

BACK TO BACK
-
spending my last moments in Mexico with my family. Now it is back to real life. Fixing my internship, fixing my tooth, fixing my financial crap. Life is simpeler when you don't have to do a lot of things. I'll miss it. But I'll be happy to regain my independence and distance myself from my brother. I can't be myself around him, he makes me feel negative, no empathy. I miss my friends. My friends know how I feel, and most importantly respect it and don't see it as a weakness.

Overal okayish day. I enjoyed visiting the campus and going to the dentist. At night I was absolutely exhausted not physically but mentally.  6/10"

Anyways, I had a productive day today at least so that is good. I paid some bills, made a phone call i needed to make, did some scheduling. Her and I went shopping together when we got home too.

""More stuff doesn't mean more fun""

Yeah another lazy day. Had a hangover and a weak stomach because of the alcohol. Just chilled mainly and avoided others, sometimes I need these days to recharge.

In the evening we went out again. We went to a bar with was really expensive. It was boring but we stayed there because it was some guys birthday. He ordered some bottles and sodiepops. I had a glass of rum and coke (which didn't taste good). I didn't really talk a lot because the others had their own conversation and I don't speak much Spanish to just enter conversations. I was happy when my cousin Lucy arrived. We hugged a lot and hold hands and talked. At the end of the evening I was bored and tired and was happy we left, until I saw the check. Goddamn it cost a lot about 400 euros or more. We shared the check which meant I had to pay like 30 euros solely for a rum and coke... fugg.

After that we went home. With 8 people in a car the size of a mini. At home we drank more but I didn't really have much energy to talk. I messaged the girl I sort of like and had a good conversation with her. Recently I made a post about how she and I aren't really a fit. But the conversation brought back old feelings. Sometimes you just want to be loved.

I give this day 1 rum and cokes out of 3. 3.3/10.

Morning - sleeping

Midday - sleeping and watching YouTube vids. I didn't have any energy. We had plans to go out but at that moment I didn't want to. I wanted to lie in bed all night, and I almost did.

Evening - I was bored, my phone didn't have a any charge so I went to the store, Jessica came with, and I'm happy she did. She lifted my spirits. At the store, bought cigarettes with 4 flavours and some cookies to try. Watched a movie I enjoyed (forgot the name, have to ask).

At midnight visiting some mariachi bar. Drank a lot and had fun. Place was bad for my ears, constant singing and instruments. But it was lots of fun, talked with a lot of strangers, it was good to see this side of me again. Lots of Tequila. Looking back I took like 15 shots and some other stuff. Jessica tought me a little salsa dancing.  I talked with the bathroom lady, was fun, she was pretty. Came home around 06:00.

Overal good day. In daylight I did nothing meaningful. The night was a lot of fun. 8/10"

0,"week update, really long post
Lots of things happened this week...

Monday - met with 2 old friends. Kinda lazy to reiterate about Jay but I talked about him in another post. Jay kept changing the topic, interrupting me, etc. Me and Jon were kind of frustrated because we really meant well and were also talking about our own struggles and it seemed like Jay just wanted to focus on playing board games and video games.

Me and Jon were on the same page, but Jay was not. It's Jay's life though, if he doesn't want to do anything, we can't force him to. He also kept trying to tease about my major, which kind of irritated me. I also asked him why he kept interrupting me and changing the topic when I was trying to be serious, it was rude.

A different time I asked him some personal questions that he didn't really have an answer to. I told him that I don't have bad intentions, that I was genuinely curious... which was true. Jay's really closed off, introverted, and not very sociable so it was difficult to be able to talk because he didn't contribute much or express himself... we joke around just fine, but the more serious topics, he avoids. Seems like he just sees me and Jon as people to play with, not take seriously. It's a real bummer.

We had met at Jon's home and he was very hospitable. It was my first time there. Jon said that I articulate ideas verbally and understand what he wants to say without trying to be offensive. Honestly I can be though, not that I'm proud.

We hit up a boba place by the university Jon & I graduated from, after the talk. We also kept making jokes about Jay (which he wasn't upset about, otherwise we would've stopped), and he made jokes about himself too in this video game we were playing (which was like mad-libs).

After Jay left, me and Jon had another talk. Turns out me and Jon have a lot in common and similar regrets in regards to family and how we treat them, it makes me glad that I am not alone like that. I really felt like I was a horrible person, but we both do have difficult backgrounds in our own ways. And then Jon started to fall asleep so I bid him and his boyfriend good night and took a Lyft home.

The driver who took me to Jon's place was quite chatty, he talked about going to a horror brewery after dropping me off and it seemed pretty cool. The driver who took me home was also quite chatty, he was a computer technician with a gamer girlfriend with a fondness for beating Donkey Kong games (I forgot what else). They both were nice.

Tuesday - Worked. I barely remember Tuesday. I did the usual - worked, went home, etc. I was likely catching up on twitter on BTS news and whatnot.

Wednesday - Saw my therapist in the morning, talked about what I went through in the past month. I woke up early to meet her. By the end, I was pretty tired of talking. She mentioned that I've been going out more, which is true. I hardly had a full day of staying home lately at that point. The weather was also pretty hot. I went to a nearby deli and it was good the first time I went there. I don't remember what I got the first time so I couldn't order it again. This time I ordered the St. Patrick's which was roast beef, tomato, lettuce, aeoli sauce (not sure if I spelled it right), in 6 inch bread. It was alright. Nice employees. Then went home and slept most of the day since I was lacking sleep. My youngest sis brought in food for me after I was awake, which was nice of her. I gave her the other half of my sandwich, we often give each other stuff.

Thursday - Worked. My sis came to pick up the youngest for a road trip and they went to the beach before going home in the next state over. There was a fire up north that day so it was cloudy, but humid. The sky was a strange color and so was the moon.

It was lonely without the youngest, so I understand how my mom feels when I take the youngest to go on a trip and my mom stays home by herself (mom hates traveling and freeways, which is why she always stays home but she has my ex-stepdad to keep her company).

Went to the 99 cent store for some snacks since I don't have a UTI anymore and binged on gummy candies like crazy because I couldn't have any sugar for the past month lol.

Friday - First actual day off without plans and it was nice. I was playing some choose-your-own adventure story games since I like that kind of stuff.

I listened to ""BTS - Epiphany"" (Jin's solo) on youtube and I was all up in my feels. I love his ballads. Also Jin is my bias in BTS, I have a soft spot for him because I can relate to him a lot. Plus I just think he's really adorable, handsome, funny, extra, talented, well-mannered, humble, considerate, I can go on. He's been my fave for almost 2 years. I go soooo soft. :')

I also fooled around in some chat rooms. Met a guy who kept throwing a tantrum because people were ignoring him because he kept trying to troll. Said he was 34... lmao.

Today - Worked again. Mostly was printing out and typing up stuff for my coworker (who is assistant in my section atm) and the rest of the employees, assistant manager, and manager.

I'm not in management, I can be, but I just don't like my job or current management enough to bust my ass for them. I used to work really hard, but then my hours got drastically cut because corporate got stingy with hours and realized there was no reward or encouragement so I just stopped caring.

My coworker who was supposed to close the store got an anxiety attack so all the people closing today are all cashiers, which is a first to ever happen the whole time I've worked there (and I've worked there since the store opened). The other floor staff who was supposed to close had another job so he couldn't come in. The manager (as usual was useless and didn't call back the assistant manager), so the assistant manager was struggling to find people to close. I told her that it wouldn't hurt to ask the cashier who was already working. He agreed, she wouldn't have asked if I hadn't mentioned it. I also stayed an extra hour since we would've been real short-staffed.

The cashier who volunteered to close took his lunch and the assistant manager was up at the registers while I was working at the computer in the office still printing and typing up guides to put into a folder for my section. The assistant manager approved of it as she needed to know the information that I already knew.

I work food, which is a lot of work and can be overwhelming. The purpose of the guides were to inform everyone of new updates, how to send invoices and food orders, how to read orders, email and contact information, just details like that. Information like that was always in email instead of actually compiled together. It really should've been done in the first place, but corporate is a mess when it comes to organizing the finer details and just blame others when people don't know what they're supposed to know. Plus the manager not a good communicator, people complain about him because he doesn't tell people what they should know.

During the extra hour that I stayed, assistant manager called me up to the register to deal with the phone while she handled a long line. A lady called asking about her hat that she may have left behind. She described it, worried, and it seemed like she really loved that hat. She said she lived far away, but was in the area. I didn't find it at first, but after we hung up I found it in our go-backs pile and immediately called her back. Turns out the cashier mistook it for one of our items, even though it didn't have a bar code lol. She started screaming out of joy haha. Made me happier that she was happy too.

Anyway I didn't really see this about myself, but the assistant manager said that if I were to be in management, I would be scary. I asked her why (I know that I have a temper but I don't yell at people so I was curious) and she said that it's because I can be strict.

I have heard other things from people that I do get angry, like if they don't do food a certain way. Honestly that was a long time ago, people don't say that anymore, but I can still see that. Food is a huge deal, sometimes people stock when I'm not there and expiration dates get mixed up, drinks are messy/disorganized in the back but neat in the front, etc.

I mean I do complain to whoever's closest by about what I saw, but I don't throw people under the bus or confront them lol. I have also been described as blunt. I don't try to be blunt all the time, but sometimes it is needed... And I mean... I guess. I just never really considered myself as somewhat intimidating. There are people who say I'm nice too, kind, cool... Though I do like to talk to my coworkers, no one really hates me or has a bad attitude towards me... or do they. Just kidding. I have nice coworkers and we hang out sometimes.

Eh.... I just think a lot. Rambling. I feel done now. I've been typing very openly and typed a lot. I kind of talked in excess. Thanks for reading to whoever made it to the end. Good night."

Work came and went, I am none the worse for it but every so slightly less poor. More work tomorrow too. I didn't hang out with Her much at all today. I tried to, but She didn't seem interested.

I have been really struggling with anxiety lately and I hate it :/ I feel like it is just going to get worse when school starts too. I am not sure what to do about it.  I could go see someone about it, but then I would have to pay for any would be meds I might get prescribed, if I even got a prescription. Work sucked today. My job is annoying me lately too. I work from like 9-6:30 most days of the week, well, I'm not home for those times due to work, but I only actually work about 6.5 hours a day usually. It sucks and is making me feel blegh. I also wasn't good with Her today. I just didn't communicate with Her at all really or do anything to help Her. I feel bad. I am going to sleep. Ugh. I am excited for the weekend...the one day on Sunday that I get because I'm back to working 10 hour Saturdays because I'm a push over. Woohoo"

I worked up the courage to join a dating app. Matched, talked, went out, and it just wasn't there for me so I called it off. So I know it's my fault I'm back to feeling lonely but I'd rather feel that than bad for lying. But in the few days we talked, it felt nice to have those kind of conversations with someone again.

The ghost is still haunting me. Close to a month of nothing from him, yet I couldn't stop thinking about him the whole time I'm out on a date with someone else. His name keeps popping up still in my autotext, but I deleted his number. So there's at least that.

I went out with some people from work and that was a lot of fun, as usual.

Went 4 days without smoking. Bought a pack today though.

I have a feeling I'm going to go through one of those no eating weeks coming up.

I'm feeling the...""physical loneliness"" of being single. And it sucks lol

Still haven't called the therapist yet but I almost feel as soon as I can find someone, I won't need one...

Still missing the ghost. Ex misses me.

I finally have the nerve to admit and write about it. Yeah it is my body that is my most fragile part of my ego. I should come to no surprise. I mean it is visible to all. And I know people notice it.

It's hard to admit you got tits bigger than some girls. You are a fucking dude. It is enormously depressing. Memories of my mom thinking I had a body of a girl. Embarrassing moments in the store, with other people. Currently my body is in a better shape. I'm less afraid to put my shirt off. But the scars are visible. I have 4 lines underneath my curves always reminding my pain.

I was close to deleting this text because even now it is hard to admit. I chose to write it because this is my diary, my thoughts should be in this book. And I have to be honest about it. I haven't always been honest, otherwise I would've written this a long time ago.

Next insecurity to write about is my penis size.

""Go down so I can go high""

Morning - waking up was annoying. Constantly noises and waking up because of alarms. My brother woke up on the wrong leg and had a bad moment. Reminds me myself.

Midday - visiting markets in the centre of Acapulco with cousins and nieces. Bought some china and had ice cream. My brother didn't went along, and honestly without being too mean, I enjoyed it. I was happy he didn't come along because I don't want to suffer because of his negativity.

Evening - visiting a ""shopping village"" or as I like to call it ""capitalism ville"". A shirt of a local football team costs a small amount of 1400 pesos. Or 65 euro. A reasonable price for a piece of cloth, right?
~
At night me and the family played hints(?). Of course I have trouble speaking Spanish but it was fun. And according to my sobrino I'm his favourite uncle. And he wanted to play hints on my team so much he cried.

Overal my brother had a down moment that I enjoyed so I could have a moment to be myself and shine. Had fun with my family. I give this day a 7.5. Could be higher if I could sleep. Right now I am tired and the rest is still playing hints at 2:00 AM +

Kicked down and out, the substitute takes place.

""What is wrong with your brother? Why does he sit all alone."" He is probably tired and didn't sleep well.    At least now he isn't hogging all the spotlight. Yeah, how sweet of me to care for my brother like that. Why don't I talk some reason to my brother? Well it's simple, primarily I don't really care how he feels after all those years of him mistreating me. Second, he might hit me or say mean things and my fragile ego can't handle that. Third, he'll probably not listen to me. So for now I focus on myself, and it feels nice.

""Two sides of the rusted coin both of the same material.""

Yesterday (3 August) - such a boring day, we were supposed to leave for Acapulco. But due to complications we decided to leave tomorrow.

Morning - 4:00 leaving for Acapulco. With 11 people in a van. I hate long trips in narrow spaces.

Midday - arriving at the house we rented. Swimming at the beach, not much fun today. We left early because it looked like tornadoes were starting everywhere.

Evening - biljarts and beer in the centre of the touristhub that Acapulco is. Had a absolute bad time, also had a good time. I'd all swing one direction in depending my ego.

Overall pretty OK day. A bit bummed that it has to end with me sleeping in a room full of other family members. I'd rather have some privacy. I give this day a 6.2 /10. But I could've have a very different scoring.

Losing makes me a sour cunt. Winning makes me a overconfident asshole.

We played pool, and I'm not the best but I surely can play a bit decent. All the balls I hit were just horrible, we played in teams and knowing in two games I haven't scored anything besides a ball of our own. I felt bad. I felt horrible. Because I messed up all the shots (and broke a beer bottle) Why can't I just admit I'm playing poorly but still enjoy it with my family. I was just sitting in the corner with a beer in my hand. And yeah here it comes, they are walking over me and asking if anything is alright. ""Are you tired?"", ""Are you sad?"". Well clearly it's yes to both of them. I can't admit it out loud.

And then I start to hit something, and a another one. 4x in a row.
Watch and notice how that fat virgin suddenly becomes more talkative. Didn't he just a few minutes ago almost cried in the corner?

The rest of the evening switched from bad to good. Just because I finally hit something."

Alright, time for another post! the anxiety monster got the better of me again today which is laaame. I am feeling better now though and told Her about my anxieties. I didn't do anything since I got home I feel. I watched a bunch of food youtube videos, and ate a lot of food because of that :p I need to make a lunch still and empty the dishwasher.

This is a post for yesterday! I was just tired and didn't feel like doing this last night and planned on doing it this morning but I totally forgot! Yesterday was ok from what I remember. I am pretty sure that I didn't end up going into work until later than I was originally scheduled to due to stupid cancellations. I don't remember feeling anxious much yesterday (not that I can say the same for today). Her and I went grocery shopping yesterday which was kind of cool. It is nice to have it done with I suppose. We also ended up cleaning some of the apartment up, we did all of our dishes which is good. Alright, that's all for now I suppose!"

Today felt long! Ick, what a Monday. I ended up going into work late again to to yet ANOTHER cancellation. But in good news it will be the last week spent dealing with this as services will be terminated due to a lack of ability to arrive on time. I feel bad about it but I think it will be better for everyone. Work was a pretty chill day honestly, I feel like i didn't do much. Time at home just flew by. I didn't do much of anything fun honestly. I did finish reading the book I was on. Only 2 left in this series and then 2 more after that for the whole universe and I will be all caught up! Man, that's pretty crazy. I had a rough morning with anxiety and feel a bit wound up now, but I just need to take some breaths and focus on mindfulness. Alright, that's all for now."
0,"1. Installing new doors, learning to be content with present
*6 August, 2018*

I desperately wanted to write a diary last week but I chose to finish reading *Eat Pray Love made me do it*. It's not because the book was so interesting, in fact, to be honest, kind of boring. Simply I set finishing the book as my plan, therefore I forced myself to fulfill it. At least, I have learned new phrases/vocabularies.

It had been raining non-stop over the last week; everything looked so dull, cloudy, wet and sad. Except rains in Saigon where they come and go fast and the glorious sunshine appears right after that, my mood is never good in rainy, gloomy days. S doesn't mind raining. He loves it. He cut grass, fixed the mail box, worked on the damp route to the pond under the rain with no raincoat. He works all the time; if it's not on his job, then the house, the yard, the pond or anything related to fixing, upgrading, repairing, building, maintaining or even destroying. In short, he needs to be busy to release energy, to feel important, accomplishments which will make him more secured and his anxiety go away.

Last Saturday, the first doors finally were delivered. S took the old, rotten French doors out, strengthened the bottom door frame and a part of the inside plywood floor devastatingly damaged by rain with wood boards; covered the door frame with asphalt (?) water-proof  sheet - it's interesting to see him use a dust-off chalk line to make perfect straight lines as marks to cut the whole panel into different sheets. Then came the most challenging part, bringing the new doors. It was a huge mistake to underestimate how heavy the doors were; S hadn't asked the delivers to place the new doors closer to the replacing area, as the result, S and especially Daddy R (poor my 66-year-old man!) were very struggling to be able to move the doors 65 feet from the back yard to the front, lift them up on the porch and fit them into the frame. The finishing part, installing the jamb and hinges which will require accuracy and correctness and another full day on the weekend to have it done hasn't come yet. Also paint them. Now, we have the beautiful partly- finished brass full-glass double doors.

During the last week, I watched some videos of Viet wives living in the U.S. on Youtube. Some go to work, some go to school; others stay at home by choice or not by choice, cooking or gardening or taking care of kids or doing all such things. No matter what they do, who they are, how older/younger their spouses are than them, they are happy with their lives, their present, their decisions, whatever roles they chose voluntarily or not. That's the most meaningful to me and what I should learn: be content with the present. I fear S's DUI past life. Now he doesn't drink (he did, quietly behind me, a few times a year and I know this will happen again as a cycle); the projects, the 26+ acre property, the married life keep him too busy to drink,  but what happened to his young years and a very-cautious-but-yet reckless S that I've known of have interfered many times with my ability to enjoy life. I know I am so weak sometimes, but I need to live a fearless, worry-free life. I am working on it. Life is unpredictable; what scares me now may end up not happening but something else. I live means I fight; so instead of fighting over unforeseen, intangible future things, I should keep focusing on what I have been doing now...."

Time for another post! I was just lazy last night and didn't feel like typing then, not a good thing to make a habit of. I've been having anxiety issues for the past few days again and I hate it. Yesterday felt pretty long (in a good way). I got to help Her write a paper She is working on for class (although I don't know how much help I was). I also found all of the books I need for when my classes start and I figured out when my classes actually begin. Everything is happening so fast! Ugh, it makes me nervous. Alright, that's all for now. I need to leave for work soon. "

Had work again today. Woke up really early because of an earthquake jolt. In my sleepy haze, I somehow thought the earthquake happened because I didn't order something at work lol. Also I had cramps... felt nauseous. Was pretty lethargic and dead on my feet. Had some Mexican candy that actually pepped me up until lunch. I was so sugar-deprived as I intentionally didn't eat anything with sugar in it for 2 months (because of my UTI).

Anyway some coworkers confided in me today about what was on their minds, I think they just really needed open ears.

After work, went to Walmart with mom. I usually go off on my own most of the time, but mom really just wanted to talk about whatever. I ended up buying a whiteboard calendar with dry erase markers and my sis was drawing on them when we got home.

Also at checkout, this guy by the registers turned his boombox on and was dancing to Miley Cyrus ""Party in the USA"" lol. All the lines stopped and many people turned their phones to the guy. The cashiers thought it was funny, the managers did not haha. Managers kept getting called to the front. Only at Walmart.

Well now that I'm home and have a day off now, I want to take it easy tomorrow. Still gotta meet Jon and Jay about that serious talk, but at least I can sleep in and have a little bit of time to myself."

So I missed the date as it's currently midnight right now lol. Going to be a really long post.

Anyway, woke up earlier than usual this morning so I'm pretty sleepy.

My friend Jon messaged me about another friend ""Jay."" Not that they'll see this or anything. Jon called me when I was about to clock in at work so he's been pretty patient since I called him around almost 11pm today. Worked, had an easy and surprisingly slow day for a Saturday. Not that I really minded since I was sleepy as heck, but everyone was bored though. Day was kinda fast and kinda slow from a mental standpoint.

Went to Joce's birthday bbq, so I just brought a bunch of cookies and ate some good food. She was a surprisingly attentive host and was pacing herself well with the alcohol.

Kept asking me if I wanted to take shots, but I had to hold off since I had been taking antibiotics and only finished yesterday. I didn't want to risk stomach bleeding so I held off just in case... plus I just started my period so I'm also not going to risk Advil tomorrow while being buzzed lol. People were doing ""cheers"" with their shots and I held up a water bottle and Joce's relative was like ""nah put that down you don't hold up water"" lmaoooo.

I played chess against Eric and I was kind of being reckless, though I did put some thought into it... not too much since I didn't want to take too long making a move. I managed to completely put him in a checkmate without taking too many pawns and he shook my hand cuz he couldn't find a way out lol. Kind of boosted my ego for a bit  even though I got lucky lol. Had good company at the kickback, but had to leave earlier than I wanted to talk to Jon like I said I would.

Anyway after I got home, it was around 10:50pm when I called him back (I was keeping him up to date about when I'd get back to him, didn't keep him hanging). Jon brought up his concerns regarding Jay, what he heard, what he's observed, etc. I was taking down some notes. I do worry about Jay too... we're going to meet on Monday at Jon's place. Jon is very concerned and worried about Jay for various reasons (Jay knows too, it's not a surprise meeting)."

Another week. Another roller coaster.

I almost enjoy the stress at work because it keeps my mind away from the loneliness at home. My best friend is worried about me smoking again. I find it almost hypocritical, but at the same time, helpful. He knows what it's like so its coming from a point of view of experience. But I told him in due time I'll quit. Just not right now.

The ghost keeps haunting me, and yet I haven't heard from him in 2 weeks. I realized when I last heard from him and thought ""wow, it's been almost a month"" until I realized it's just been two, slow, painful weeks. I'm sure he's forgotten about me by now. Yesterday at work, I was in my comforting stress, and just out of the blue, he hit me hard. Suddenly and as painful as if it was a physical hit. Just flooded with the wanting to hear from him again. But I fell asleep and moved on with my night/day. But then, Tonight, I went to text my sister and his name popped up on my phone due to their names having similar letters. That goofy ass picture, the only one he sent me, flashed for just a moment and it was another punch to the stomach. I've thought about joining a dating site or something. But then thought to myself ""if I can't handle what this one guy did to me, I can't handle more doing the same.""

From loneliness, I can't seem to drop my ex as I did before. Sending him small things like a picture of his favorite movie or my dog. Never of me. He can't get that again. But I hate myself because it just needs to end like it did before. I would just block him from everything but if anything happens in an emergency, I have no one else physically close enough to help. I wont fall for him again, and that isnt self pep talk. No I literally know I cant because that ship has sailed. A while ago.

For the first time in months, I have alcohol in my house. Not from sadness, but simply because I wanted beer and it's cheaper to buy a 6 pack than a tab at the bar.

I'm watching the new season of one of my shows. And there's a tense romantic scene. So in start the waterworks... part of the reason I don't drink at home anymore. Just wanting that connection with someone... not just anyone. The ghost..

Seven years ago today, I had my first experience with a friend passing away. He was only 20. In seven years, I haven't gone to his grave, yet I've always wanted to. I remember when I found out he died, I thought it was a stupid joke going around Facebook. And then I cried. For days. Had dreams about him, so real, I still remember the details to the day. I'm going to go see him tomorrow. Have a little talk. We didn't have a lot of moments together but the ones we did were pretty awesome...

4 months ago, I told my sister I wanted to be the new me by my birthday. 3 weeks to go, and I'm not going to make that deadline. Yet I feel like a disappointment because I won't get there.

Monday I'm scheduling my appointment with a therapist. Medication will be the last option as there's a family history of that going bad.

It keeps raining. And I used to love the rain (except for lightning). But now I just look at it and think of the one cliche thing every girl dreams of: being kissed in a downpour. And in starts the loneliness, sadness, depression... I know, everyone says ""don't rely on others for your happiness"" but when making someone happy makes me my absolute happiest, how can I deny myself that?

So, TLDR: Still lonely. Still depressed. Visiting my friend's grave.

It's going to be a long weekend...."

Morning - saying goodbye to coatepetec and my family there. My little niece finally doesn't cry anymore when I get close. When she played with rubber bands she dropped the box. I helped her. And afterwards she said thanks (with her moms help). I was able to give her a kiss and say goodbye.

Midday - in the car back to Mexico. So tired constantly fell asleep.

Evening - nothing much, ate a pizza and watched last chance U. I'm excited the NFL season is beginning soon. It's super American but I enjoy the long season of sport.

Short day, nothing special but sometimes it is nice to know you have nothing planned. I give this day a 5.8. Got some love from my niece. Ate unealthy. And watched TV for like 4 hours.

Creatures that enter your sleep and possess you. Those things cause sleep paralysis and seduce you to do bad things. Figures that move in the shadow and watch you all day. At least so my brother tells me. He also mentioned various encounters that some of his friends endured. I'm a grown man that isn't easily scared. But at night in my bed it creeped me out a little.

Sometimes I wonder I've there might be truly things such as demons or other ""higher powers"". But I know as long as I stay a positive, humble and respectful person I'll be safe."

Alright, time for another post. Today was.... kind of blegh. I feel stressed out about the future and not really knowing what I want to do in life. I need to look into more school stuff. I think I will like my future field more than my current work, and I don't even hate my current work really. I just need to figure out a way to avoid student loans as best as I possibly can. But it is looking like I will have a pretty hefty amount of loans regardless which is going to suck. And now reading more into my field makes me worried that there won't be even good pay to get out of it which is more nerve wracking. Life is hard. I tried to do some mindfulness stuff today though and just focus on the present and I liked that. I will do more of that tomorrow. Alright, that's all for now.

Today was alright. Went to work in the morning, grocery shopped for a bit, then went home.

At work I learned that the robberies might have actually been internal and someone from corporate may have been leaking the info to the robbers. The robbers knew the layouts of the stores and where the safes were being kept. And dude!! 5 stores were broken into since the string of robberies started happening. Seriously nuts. I wonder who in corporate may be leaking the info... but it's not really the first time I've heard of someone in corporate who had a hand in some shady stuff.

The last head of the company was actually laundering money. Another guy in corporate was fired for working for the competitor (double-crossing our company) and he was also stealing money. The list goes on.

Anyway, went to a nearby grocery store with my coworker because I wasn't getting picked up today (mom took sis to the mall bc sis wanted to hang out with her friends). We took the same bus since we live along the same route and chatted for a bit.

Also I'm still recovering from my UTI but good news!! I'm going to the bathroom normally again... I also have 2 more pills left for my antibiotic. I really really hope my UTI issue has been dealt with. I will make the appropriate follow up appointment again next week."

I've been having a rough marriage my wife has cheated and after some time I forgave her and allowed her to move back in. Now she's doing everything like before and expects me not to believe that she's cheating.

I keep saying if I can just get her to answer the big questions that she won't ask herself then instead of this quagmire of pain and doubt there will be an answer. The biggest is also the easiest, are you using the past to help us or to seperate us.

""Today my heart swings""

Morning - I woke up feeling messy, not much sleep and the children are making a lot of noise. I did wake up with a message from the girl I like. We had a decent conversation which made me think.

Midday - we wanted to go rafting but it was too expensive and not everyone could join. So swimming it was. In the jungle there were waterfall ridges were you could swim, a really fun experience. The mountains, the vegetation and the noise.

Evening - visiting a friend of my uncle for my brother who wants more information about vanilla and vanilla products. And driving around town, because my uncle needs to paint it? I don't know and don't really care. I just was there along for the ride.

Swimming was fun but made me very tired. Slowed down the rest for the day. I got stressed a lot because one of my baby nieces. She keeps crying when I get close, and refuses to shake any of our hands. She keeps crying for her mom and demands her attention. When your having a conversation it gets annoying quickly. Overall this day gets 6/10, not bad but nothing special.

And someone commented on my diariy which is think is really dope.

Morning message: how do you (really) feel
-
Waking up and seeing her message gave me energy, my brother noticed my smile as I texted her. I was happy she texted me as it is a sign of affection, but how far does it go? There is two questions I have:

‚Ä¢ Does she like me?
  When she asked what I really wanted to see. I said ""you"". As she followed with saying. ""Yeah, I really want to see you and the rest too."" I know she struggled with that one. I could see she kept writing new lines on WhatsApp. And it took long. The thing is she doesn't have a strong character, she doubts a lot.

‚Ä¢ Does she match with me?
I like women with a strong character. Women with clear goals, but also an open mind, independent and caring. She wants a man who takes her by the hand and shows her the world. A machoman if you will. And I am everything besides a macho, and she isn't feisty, not capable of adjusting to the situation in her own character.

She is a ball that rolls with only the environment directing it. I want a RC car. Something that can go one direction but still change if it wants to."

Alright time for another post. My diet got off the rails a bit today. I just had to wake up for work a bit earlier than usual and I am staying up later so I ate more throughout the day. I also didn't log everything that I ate and I didn't workout (my excuse being that my body is still, but that's not a good reason). I had some anxiety earlier in the day about smallish stuff that I am just trying to ignore. She went to bed pretty quickly after I got home, She was really tired.

Just gonna talk about my UTI (urinary tract infection). It's an infection in the urethra and mine was infected by e-coli. I had been battling it for the past 2 months. Not fun. Basically it's the urge to pee constantly, like 5 times in an hour. It also burns. It can be caused by different things: sex, bad hygiene, holding urine and/or other bodily fluids in, wiping from back to front, etc.

So I slept last night around 7pm and woke up around 9am. I was really exhausted and catching up on sleep and I have been stressed by various things. I've been rethinking some things due to trauma, but that's for another time.

I think I'm feeling better today in regards to my UTI. I used a strip test that shows colors depending on whether it detects white blood cells in my urine. The color is lighter than when I first took the test, which means the antibiotic is working.

And I am pleased to say that I'm not allergic to penicillin!! I am so relieved and happy about that. I will see until I finish the medication to see if I don't have bad side effects. I'm using penicillin medication instead of sulfa.

With the sulfa antibiotic I had muscle weakness, swollen lymph nodes, oral thrush, and a stiff neck. Turns out I was allergic to sulfa medications and I found out last week when I got put back on it and I had an allergic reaction. The reaction was that I had sores in my mouth, tongue rawness, red eyes from swollen blood vessels, redness in my palms, skin discoloration (beginnings of rashes I think), a migraine, tingly lips, and a puffed up face with swollen lips/eyes/cheeks.

Repeated doses of sulfa caused my body to produce antibodies to fight the medication last month and that's what happened. I wasn't allergic at first until about 10 days in. So my UTI didn't completely go away because the medication was being rejected by my body and without the medication, it couldn't fight the UTI.

I also had a swollen lymph node a few days ago which indicates infection, but it has gotten SMALLER now so it means the new medication was fighting the infection (instead of my body fighting the medication). :)

I will test my urine again with the strip on Friday to test for white blood cells after I finish the antibiotic and also ask my doctor for a urine culture as well.

Also apparently the doctor I have is kind of incompetent. He ordered a urine culture in the middle of me taking the antibiotic instead of in the beginning so it won't be an accurate test. And that he didn't recognize that I had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic I had, he said it was a side-effect due to my stiff neck and swollen lymph nodes. I could've died had I chosen to continue the dose the following month, I had the prescription from an urgent care doctor.

Anyway, I'm still going to the toilet a lot. It will be a while until my body is normal again. But it doesn't burn down there right now. It was still burning on Sunday (and today's Wednesday). I have one more day's worth of the antibiotic and then I will ask for an appointment next week so the antibiotic will be out of my system and I can test more accurately.

I want this to be over with, I'm tired of taking medication, going to doctors, doing urine tests... I just want to live life normally again."

Morning - leaving poza rica, glad I'm leaving that hell hole behind. So damn hot. Gonna miss my family over there though.

Midday - driving to coatepetec. I hate long drives, the music gets stale, my leg gets numb and I can't fall asleep.

Evening - arriving at my tio abuelitos house. There is a strange atmosphere here. And one of my young cousins instantly dislikes me and starts to cry when I get close. The other nephew and cousin are strangely nice. And the family here is very rich I think. Visiting the village with my uncle. Confusing, but I enjoyed it.

Overall a good day, very strange but hey, it makes for some good talking material. 7/10

Beers, bakery's and the bolice.

My uncle took me and my brother for a beer. Little did I know that one beer was 1 liter. After that we went to visit a bakery at 11:59 pm. Smoke filled the street from the bakery. And inside where men working who didn't mind us coming inside. A tray with leftover food was in the middle and we were free too take what we wanted. We went on foot and learned more about the village. After that we knocked on bar doors which were supposed to be closed (I think), to get some strange drink. The rest of the evening was us trying to find a nightclub to party at with no success (it is Tuesday). We went and saw (partially) the Nestl√© and coca cola factory and the (evil) story behind them.

The uncle likes to drive fast, which I like too. He also likes to run red lights. Which the police (might?) have noticed. Lights and the sound of sirens where very noticeable behind us, and we stopped. Our uncle apologised but the cops drove further.

I honestly thought we were just going for a beer run.

Pain brings us together.

But honestly as a outsider, or in this case myself. Reading about times that were fun, what fun is that? Talking about how shitty life is, how much you want to off yourself is far more interesting. Or writing about that one girl you really like and how much you want to stick your peeper in her hoocher. People bond more over pain. And people fetish themselves over massive enjoyments. The extremes are what is interesting."
0,"Talking to someone who won't hear me
Tonight I socialized with strangers. Went well, had fun, but I'll never see those people again. They play D&D, you would've had more to talk to them about than I did. And even though it's far from you, I was hoping to see you there simply because it was nerdy. Part of me hoped you would go hoping to see me (knowing how much I love that fandom). And for 1 fleeting moment, I thought I saw you. But it wasn't, obviously. I think about you when I sing now. Which sucks, because I love to sing. I think about your reaction to my bag, how you thought it was so cool. I think about you more than I should. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" run into you over the weekend, but I didn't. More angry, imaginary conversations with you today. And when I hear someone describe someone, I try to pick out details to see if somehow it's you. I know I'm crazy. Maybe call me obsessed, I don't care at this point. All I know is something change within me because of you. I was almost done with you and then tonight just sent me crashing back to Planet You. I don't want to wear that dress from our first date. I don't want to see Jurassic Park again. I don't want to go downtown again. I don't want to do any of that. Unless you surface me from your memory banks.
You made me feel forgettable. You made me feel stupid. You made me feel like I was nobody...
You made me feel happy. And joyful. And like the light was back in my eyes and the spark was in my smile. You made me feel safe. And adored. And pretty.

And you don't care. But if you knew all this, I tell myself you would care, tremendously.

If by some random chance you see this... I'm sorry."

How it it already Wednesday tomorrow? I really don't understand. Anyways yesterday was ok. I only worked for like 2 hours though which is kind of sucky. Today I worked more (less than usual still) and it felt long. I think I need to just quit playing Overwatch after work. Yesterday Her and I ate chipotle for dinner which wasn't that great. It kind of tasted like tuna salad which is really bizarre. Ugh. I feel sad and frustrated for stupid reasons right now and I don't like it. I had some bad thoughts both today and yesterday. I need to get that under control. I exercised today though which is awesome. I don't feel like working tomorrow. I need to find something to eat. Also, today I got some free food which is good. And I am really under on my calories so far today which is also good. Alright, that's all for now. I am tired of typing. blegh."

I'm getting ready to the better travel of my live, hitchhiking, without money around 8 countries at South America. I'm waiting for the summer to start. While it don't happen, I try improve my spanish skills, self-development, mindfulness, bodyweight skills, and save money (but I won't use travelling).

I hitchhiked 2.000 Kilometers and while I'm living at a big city. This month I became so antisocial, maybe because the people here only job, sleep, job, and do it again and again.

But I enjoyed the beginning of the month. I visited my old friends and hang out at differents places that we don't knew. I was to some parties, it was crazy and fun haha And now I'll continue enjoying only at house.

Work pretty much sucks. The environment sucks. I like most of my coworkers, but the management styles of corporate and such leaves much to be desired.

I don't expect management to kiss my ass or anything. Just treat me like a normal human being, with respect and decency like you would a colleague.

Went to a meeting today and one of the guys in corporate just started yelling to the room of managers and employees: ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS. I DON'T CARE IF-"" blah blah blah. I don't care either, I don't even know his name, his words are irrelevant to me as it didn't apply to me anyway. It was about doing bank deposits because a string of robberies have been happening by criminals (not internal theft)...

It's the attitude that really makes me hate my workplace. I don't shout at people saying ""I don't care,"" honestly nobody may have said anything but we don't care either lmao. Like if you don't care, I don't care. We only get paid minimum wage anyway, aside from the managers.

Like it's been said, people quit managers, not jobs. Applies to the upper level. Three people in HR have quit in the same week, that really says a lot.

Also saw an email last year that had an ex-manager talking shit about someone in corporate, which I thought was hilarious and I actually sent the email to myself to laugh at later. Of course I covered my tracks and got rid of the evidence that I sent it to myself. Like I'm not the only one who feels this way. But easy pay, pays a little more than some other places, and flexible schedule. Got comfortable. Also I got sick recently so I had to hold off on building hard skills.

Our corporate has this kind of attitude where they don't tell you everything, then tell you when you needed to know earlier, and a minute later they shame you or make you look like an idiot for not knowing. Even though they say ""If you have any questions ask us."" Like sure tell me but don't be condescending about it. And they don't properly train people or inform people. Not even the manager knew everything he should.

And lmao the manager was trying to send his assistant managers to other stores (probably to upwards hire his favorite employee) and the assistant managers were like... nah. If they had to leave, they would've taken either me or the favorite because we know our shit (I've been an employee for 3.5 years and I do my stuff). But anyway it's a dead-end job, there's openings for upwards mobility but hell nah. If they treated their employees better I would've considered it tbh. Or open another location in our city and I'll consider, but I'm not going to another city for shit pay and shit treatment.

Plus they've been scrambling to up their security and get their shit together like I've been saying since I almost got my ass beat by some thieves months back (I got their pictures on my phone, which is why they targeted me). I stopped closing since then. And now that robberies have been happening we finally get a security guard... but only after closing hours.

TBH I'm so sorry for that security guard, I met him today and he's kind of an old guy... the criminals are strong and can likely beat him up. Our store might be targeted soon because they're getting closer to us. But we'll see..."

""Constantly thinking, what on earth do they say? It requires energy.""

Morning - breakfast at some restaurant, my uncle was talking to me, but he is hard to understand, I love the man, but he kept on talking. I want to follow, but a different language and hard to understand, it requires a lot of energy.

Midday - to the beach once more. I am officially poor right now with a balance of 0 pesos. The beach was fun, nothing really special.

Evening - driving back home and eating quesadillas. It seems like I have a better connection with my niece now, which I like!

My Spanish is getting much better, but it still requires a lot of energy to listen and talk. At the end of the day I'm exhausted.

HOUSES AND MONEY
Metal plates as roof, open holes in the wall, no faucets. No TV and the garden is just a slid next to the open wall. The floor is concrete, and the wall is just bricks. I just realized how accustomed to modernization I am.

Sometimes I get the feeling that my Mexican family thinks I'm rich. Which I assure you I am not. In fact I constantly stress over my financial situation. It is not because I'm unwise with my money but because I am a student and pay for everything myself, without a steady income. The thought of having to pay back my student loan later haunts me.

My aunt jokingly said I should get a good job and buy a luxurious house here close to the beach for my future wife and myself. So I can share it with the rest of my family. I know she said it jokingly, but what does she aspect that in the future I'll be having multiple houses? Right now I feel pain for looking at the prices on a menu card at a simple restaurant."

Negative first, to get it out of the way:
- I've gone from neutral about him to almost mad. Part of my process I guess. I keep going through all these imaginary conversations I'd have if I ever got the chance. Yet I still find myself obsessing over simply how he made me feel. I could practically see him last night as I went over one of these conversations. Can't help get a tiny bit hopeful when my phone goes off, especially late at night.
- I'm angry at being alone. Not just in a relationship stand point, but just in general. Mad at all the people I once called friends. Mad at my exes. Mad at him. Mad at my coworkers. Just....mad. Hurt. Confused. I don't do well with no having answers, and I have a lot of unanswered questions. All boiling down to one simple word. ""Why"".
- I'm getting very unhappy with how I look. I was ok for a while. I guess because I wasn't eating after he ghosted me. And without a scale, I guess I thought I was losing the weight I wanted, even though not in the right way. But once I catch up financially, I want to start trying again. I just have no will power. And my only workout buddy only likes to really talk about the guy she's (emotionally) cheating on her husband with.
- My dog doesn't even want to be around me anymore.
- $575 behind in bills.
- Back to smoking, already.

Positive, to end on a good note:
- My raise from Friday was actually activated last Monday so I'll have a full paycheck this week with a little bit of OT. Hoping that helps.
- Going to see my favorite football team, on my birthday. Big-ish deal when they're across the country and rarely ever play in my home state.
- I'm baking a pie (at some point) for my boss. I love baking, so I'm hoping it helps take my mind off things, even for a few hours.
- Had a good weekend with my brother and his fiancee. Though it does remind me how alone I am sometimes.
- Stressful day at work, but the increase in pay made it easier to push through.
- Thought I was more in the $700s behind in bills, so I'm not as bad as I thought.
- Too broke to buy more cigarettes after this pack, so that's good in a way.
- Trying to get my life back, even just a little insignificant change at a time."

""one beats many depending on how much you care""

Morning - visited the house of Tio abuelito Lalo. A bit weird, I have a weird connection with him. Although I feel blessed that he cares for us to visit his house. His energy at his age is inspiring.

Midday - visiting the centrum of poza rica, bought some souvenirs for friends and family. The markets made me feel dizzy, it is so crowded and small.

Evening - dinner and karaoke at tio Angel's house. I had a real good time. I keep meeting family members I've never seen.

Veracruz, poza rica. The place where my mother grew up with her brothers and sisters. Although my mom is gone, her family is what she left me.

HOMESICK (a little bit)
-
I know what I miss.
I miss my friends.
I miss playing the drums.
I miss watching TV series on my own.
I miss the opportunity to be alone.
I miss the opportunity to go to the bathroom with privacy.
I miss being able to exercise and eating healthy.

And honestly that is about it. I tell you what I don't miss.

The mess our student kitchen can be.
The heat and drought in the Netherlands at the moment.
The financial/internship stress
Being alone constantly and isolating myself.
Eating mediocre food.
Being bored a lot and not knowing what to do.
Mainly the hole of feeling alone and confused.

KARAOKE WITH LOVE
-
""Karaoke, again?"" As my aunt whips out her microphone. My family loves karaoke it's the third time in two weeks we've done a karaoke night. At first only two aunt's were singing. Of course they pressured me, and after a few beers I wanted to sing. Later in the evening my uncle and I stayed outside while the rest of my family is inside. We've already sang a few songs. But we kept on singing. Songs like ""like a stone"", ""kryptonite"" and some Mexican songs. We both can't sing well. But together it was fun. I am glad we had such a good time together.

BAD WRITING

This would have been Thursday I believe. I am trying to remember why I didn't post this day and I really am not sure. I know that I got home pretty late from work, maybe that is the reason? Oh. I also had a lot of cancellations for work earlier in the day and couldn't move any of them up which sucked. But what did I do that day? I think I might have played some video games. I don't think Her and I watched anything though. But I feel like we did something fun. Idr anymore. Anyways, it was a good day overall I think.

Part 613
This was Friday! This happened to be a great day actually. I a short day due to more cancellations, which is really unfortunate honestly. I need more hours but there is no way for me to get them. But I was able to get off of work earlier which was nice and then Her and I cleaned the apartment up nice and good. Then some of Her family got here and we played a short little board game for a while before heading off to another escape room! No one else in the party except for Her and I had done one before and it was cool to have such a large group. I still feel like I didn't help much which isn't that fun :/ but we did get out! Alright, that's all for that day.

For Her part 614
Another solid day but it did give me some anxiety. Well, first we spent the morning planning to look around at different car lots for Her with Her brother... but She ended up getting one at the first place we went :p She seems happy with it and if She doesn't like it well the lease is still up in 2 years anyway. Live and learn. It's a nice car though. After that I had to go to work which was ok. One of my coworkers made me anxious but I told Her about it and I'm just being crazy. When I got back everyone pretty much went to sleepy shortly thereafter. That's all for that! Oh, I also made killer tips at work.

For Her Part 615
Ahhh Sunday. My one actual day off. It was good. We all woke up early and went to the zoo near us (which I've never been to) and it was pretty cool. I don't love zoos, but they are still kind of fun. After that we got lunch at a local buffet and then Her family had to drive back home. Her and I got some groceries and cleaned our vehicles. We also ended up getting pizza for dinner which was delicious. Her and I just did our own stuff for the night, I should have done something with Her. Well, I need a shower.

Evening - visiting the centrum for dinner and buying stuff.

I haven't written much in my actual diary, I tried to write some at the beach, but I don't enjoy writing with other people next to me. And in the mornings or evenings I don't have the time or energy to write and draw. I'm 3 days behind now.

DEATH IS GOOD
-
During my visit at the beach I talked with a very nice Mexican hombre. We talked about various things such as: languages, his family, and beers. When we talked about beers he gave me one to try, and after that another. Before you know it I've got a good buzz going on and I start to talk more like I normally do.

When he mentioned his family the topic of his wife came up. When she went to visit the sea. The man told me how she was 10 months sick, and hasn't got long to live anymore. A bit weird, but death is part of the Mexican culture. Still, it makes me a bit sad that this nice man might lose his loved one. He seemed to love to have conversations. And talking with him lifted my spirit up, I too should talk with more people.

Thanks for talking with me se√±or, I wish you and your family the best.

UP DOWN, DOWN UP

Goddamn, from being suicidal to ""oh wow life isn't too bad"". How fast things change. Maybe it's just my bipolar acting up. Either way i'm in a good flow now, and I'm getting drunk on it. I've been chatting with my aunt's, chatting with random people. Overal: good shit. Although in the morning it wasn't too good, in the literal sense. It's these chili's man. Fire in the hole.

PINA COLADA WITH VODKA AND PERMANENT PMS
-
One of my aunt's is a true firery woman. I haven't got a good connection with her. But today we connected a little. I helped her by choosing a pair of sunglasses. Using my uber design skilzz, I mentioned how the outline of the glasses fits her face better than the other. She seemed to appreciate the opinion.

It's hard to understand her. She doesn't seem like an angry or mean spirited person. She looks rather like she is stressed. Which I understand as she has two young children and a husband who is away a lot. But boy, I had a taste of her pina colada and it's safe to say she wasn't humble on the wodka. I like alcohol but damn, that stuff was on another level."

Morning - preparing to leave for mexico city
Midday - chilling at Tia Gloria and watching TV  with nieces
Evening - taking the autobus with abuelita and Niels

One thing that I have learned here in Mexico is the warmth of the people. Hello and saying heartfelt goodbye. Giving your uncle a hand and a hug, your aunt and niece a kiss and a hug. With my nieces I notice the ""warmth"" more. It almost like they are your girlfriend; holding hands, giving hugs, leaning against eachother and sharing a lot.

I notice how cold I can be sometimes. Eventhough I know that I can be a warm person. I can be friendly, I can share, tell good stories. But I close myself if I can't show who I really am, if I am at the bottom, if I am not ""cool"", because I barely speak their language. I say nothing and hide in the corner. I mainly notice this in the company of my brother. So far he hasn't shared anything positive, the only things he shares is negativety. And he doesn't slowdown on it. The negativety is where he gets his pride, his proof that he is higher than other people.

At home I am too cold aswell, it is not who I am. I am not the cold, heartless calculist that people think I am. I am the guy that laughs with a big grin, that shares, and wants the best for everybody. I will find him again.

It was pretty fun though. A lot of the people that I like working with the most were on my shift so it was a good time and not too stressful at all. I need to take a shower but I think I'm just going to do that in the morning. Her and I need to go grocery shopping together tomorrow, ugh. Alright, that's all for now. "

Why am I not sad he left? Earlier this week, he was so mad at me for something I didn't do. I was upset that he didn't believe me, but I never cried. Last night while I was at work, he packed up his kid and left my house with no text or call, he didn't respond to my text til this morning. I'm still not sad. I don't have any urge to find out why. I'm more upset that I spent so much money at the grocery store yesterday to feed all of us this weekend than I am that he left. Is it over? I don't know, but I do know, right now, I don't care. He's my best friend, not my bf, it's not a break up. Friends do drift apart."

Today was an ok day overall. I know I had some bad thoughts throughout the day, but I'm feeling good now. Today went by so quickly and so slowly at the same time. I feel that, overall, this Summer is sprinting by though. My hours got kind of weird at work today but ended up working themselves out. I didn't get home till 7ish because I worked till 6 and then picked up pizza for dinner for Her and I. We didn't really interact much this evening and that's on both of us. We are going to get up early and go to the store though so that will be something. I just spent the evening watch twich and youtube videos and redditing. Nothing of value gained and kind of a waste of time tbh. bleh. Alright, that's all for now."
